<a name="l257"><span class="ln">257  </span></a><span class="s0">Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home</span>
<a name="l258"><span class="ln">258  </span></a><span class="s0">and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings</span>
<a name="l259"><span class="ln">259  </span></a><span class="s0">of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world</span>
<a name="l260"><span class="ln">260  </span></a><span class="s0">with very little to distress or vex her.</span>
<a name="l261"><span class="ln">261  </span></a>
<a name="l262"><span class="ln">262  </span></a><span class="s0">She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,</span>
<a name="l263"><span class="ln">263  </span></a><span class="s0">indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,</span>
<a name="l264"><span class="ln">264  </span></a><span class="s0">been mistress of his house from a very early period.  Her mother</span>
<a name="l265"><span class="ln">265  </span></a><span class="s0">had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct</span>
<a name="l266"><span class="ln">266  </span></a><span class="s0">remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied</span>
<a name="l267"><span class="ln">267  </span></a><span class="s0">by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short</span>
<a name="l268"><span class="ln">268  </span></a><span class="s0">of a mother in affection.</span>
<a name="l269"><span class="ln">269  </span></a>
<a name="l270"><span class="ln">270  </span></a><span class="s0">Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family,</span>
<a name="l271"><span class="ln">271  </span></a><span class="s0">less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,</span>
<a name="l272"><span class="ln">272  </span></a><span class="s0">but particularly of Emma.  Between _them_ it was more the intimacy</span>
<a name="l273"><span class="ln">273  </span></a><span class="s0">of sisters.  Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal</span>
<a name="l274"><span class="ln">274  </span></a><span class="s0">office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed</span>
<a name="l275"><span class="ln">275  </span></a><span class="s0">her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being</span>
<a name="l276"><span class="ln">276  </span></a><span class="s0">now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and</span>
<a name="l277"><span class="ln">277  </span></a><span class="s0">friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;</span>
<a name="l278"><span class="ln">278  </span></a><span class="s0">highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by</span>
<a name="l279"><span class="ln">279  </span></a><span class="s0">her own.</span>
<a name="l280"><span class="ln">280  </span></a>
<a name="l281"><span class="ln">281  </span></a><span class="s0">The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having</span>
<a name="l282"><span class="ln">282  </span></a><span class="s0">rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little</span>
<a name="l283"><span class="ln">283  </span></a><span class="s0">too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened</span>
<a name="l284"><span class="ln">284  </span></a><span class="s0">alloy to her many enjoyments.  The danger, however, was at present</span>
<a name="l285"><span class="ln">285  </span></a><span class="s0">so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes</span>
<a name="l286"><span class="ln">286  </span></a><span class="s0">with her.</span>
<a name="l287"><span class="ln">287  </span></a>
<a name="l288"><span class="ln">288  </span></a><span class="s0">Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any</span>
<a name="l289"><span class="ln">289  </span></a><span class="s0">disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.  It was Miss</span>
<a name="l290"><span class="ln">290  </span></a><span class="s0">Taylor's loss which first brought grief.  It was on the wedding-day</span>
<a name="l291"><span class="ln">291  </span></a><span class="s0">of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought</span>
<a name="l292"><span class="ln">292  </span></a><span class="s0">of any continuance.  The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,</span>
<a name="l293"><span class="ln">293  </span></a><span class="s0">her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect</span>
<a name="l294"><span class="ln">294  </span></a><span class="s0">of a third to cheer a long evening.  Her father composed himself</span>
<a name="l295"><span class="ln">295  </span></a><span class="s0">to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit</span>
<a name="l296"><span class="ln">296  </span></a><span class="s0">and think of what she had lost.</span>
<a name="l297"><span class="ln">297  </span></a>
<a name="l298"><span class="ln">298  </span></a><span class="s0">The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.  Mr. Weston</span>
<a name="l299"><span class="ln">299  </span></a><span class="s0">was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,</span>
<a name="l300"><span class="ln">300  </span></a><span class="s0">and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering</span>
<a name="l301"><span class="ln">301  </span></a><span class="s0">with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished</span>
<a name="l302"><span class="ln">302  </span></a><span class="s0">and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.</span>
<a name="l303"><span class="ln">303  </span></a><span class="s0">The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.</span>
<a name="l304"><span class="ln">304  </span></a><span class="s0">She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen</span>
<a name="l305"><span class="ln">305  </span></a><span class="s0">years--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five</span>
<a name="l306"><span class="ln">306  </span></a><span class="s0">years old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse</span>
<a name="l307"><span class="ln">307  </span></a><span class="s0">her in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses</span>
<a name="l308"><span class="ln">308  </span></a><span class="s0">of childhood.  A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the</span>
<a name="l309"><span class="ln">309  </span></a><span class="s0">intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect</span>
<a name="l310"><span class="ln">310  </span></a><span class="s0">unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their</span>
<a name="l311"><span class="ln">311  </span></a><span class="s0">being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.</span>
<a name="l312"><span class="ln">312  </span></a><span class="s0">She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,</span>
<a name="l313"><span class="ln">313  </span></a><span class="s0">well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,</span>
<a name="l314"><span class="ln">314  </span></a><span class="s0">interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,</span>
<a name="l315"><span class="ln">315  </span></a><span class="s0">in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak</span>
<a name="l316"><span class="ln">316  </span></a><span class="s0">every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her</span>
<a name="l317"><span class="ln">317  </span></a><span class="s0">as could never find fault.</span>
<a name="l318"><span class="ln">318  </span></a>
<a name="l319"><span class="ln">319  </span></a><span class="s0">How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was</span>
<a name="l320"><span class="ln">320  </span></a><span class="s0">going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must</span>
<a name="l321"><span class="ln">321  </span></a><span class="s0">be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them,</span>
<a name="l322"><span class="ln">322  </span></a><span class="s0">and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,</span>
<a name="l323"><span class="ln">323  </span></a><span class="s0">natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering</span>
<a name="l324"><span class="ln">324  </span></a><span class="s0">from intellectual solitude.  She dearly loved her father, but he</span>
<a name="l325"><span class="ln">325  </span></a><span class="s0">was no companion for her.  He could not meet her in conversation,</span>
<a name="l326"><span class="ln">326  </span></a><span class="s0">rational or playful.</span>
<a name="l327"><span class="ln">327  </span></a>
<a name="l328"><span class="ln">328  </span></a><span class="s0">The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had</span>
<a name="l329"><span class="ln">329  </span></a><span class="s0">not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;</span>
<a name="l330"><span class="ln">330  </span></a><span class="s0">for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity</span>
<a name="l331"><span class="ln">331  </span></a><span class="s0">of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;</span>
<a name="l332"><span class="ln">332  </span></a><span class="s0">and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart</span>
<a name="l333"><span class="ln">333  </span></a><span class="s0">and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him</span>
<a name="l334"><span class="ln">334  </span></a><span class="s0">at any time.</span>
<a name="l335"><span class="ln">335  </span></a>
<a name="l336"><span class="ln">336  </span></a><span class="s0">Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,</span>
<a name="l337"><span class="ln">337  </span></a><span class="s0">being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond</span>
<a name="l338"><span class="ln">338  </span></a><span class="s0">her daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must</span>
<a name="l339"><span class="ln">339  </span></a><span class="s0">be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next</span>
<a name="l340"><span class="ln">340  </span></a><span class="s0">visit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children,</span>
<a name="l341"><span class="ln">341  </span></a><span class="s0">to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.</span>
<a name="l342"><span class="ln">342  </span></a>
<a name="l343"><span class="ln">343  </span></a><span class="s0">Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,</span>
<a name="l344"><span class="ln">344  </span></a><span class="s0">to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,</span>
<a name="l345"><span class="ln">345  </span></a><span class="s0">and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.  The Woodhouses</span>
<a name="l346"><span class="ln">346  </span></a><span class="s0">were first in consequence there.  All looked up to them.  She had</span>
<a name="l347"><span class="ln">347  </span></a><span class="s0">many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,</span>
<a name="l348"><span class="ln">348  </span></a><span class="s0">but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss</span>
<a name="l349"><span class="ln">349  </span></a><span class="s0">Taylor for even half a day.  It was a melancholy change; and Emma</span>
<a name="l350"><span class="ln">350  </span></a><span class="s0">could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,</span>
<a name="l351"><span class="ln">351  </span></a><span class="s0">till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.</span>
<a name="l352"><span class="ln">352  </span></a><span class="s0">His spirits required support.  He was a nervous man, easily depressed;</span>
<a name="l353"><span class="ln">353  </span></a><span class="s0">fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;</span>
<a name="l354"><span class="ln">354  </span></a><span class="s0">hating change of every kind.  Matrimony, as the origin of change,</span>
<a name="l355"><span class="ln">355  </span></a><span class="s0">was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled</span>
<a name="l356"><span class="ln">356  </span></a><span class="s0">to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but</span>
<a name="l357"><span class="ln">357  </span></a><span class="s0">with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,</span>
<a name="l358"><span class="ln">358  </span></a><span class="s0">when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from</span>
<a name="l359"><span class="ln">359  </span></a><span class="s0">his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to</span>
<a name="l360"><span class="ln">360  </span></a><span class="s0">suppose that other people could feel differently from himself,</span>
<a name="l361"><span class="ln">361  </span></a><span class="s0">he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad</span>
<a name="l362"><span class="ln">362  </span></a><span class="s0">a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal</span>
<a name="l363"><span class="ln">363  </span></a><span class="s0">happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l364"><span class="ln">364  </span></a><span class="s0">Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him</span>
<a name="l365"><span class="ln">365  </span></a><span class="s0">from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him</span>
<a name="l366"><span class="ln">366  </span></a><span class="s0">not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,</span>
<a name="l367"><span class="ln">367  </span></a>
<a name="l368"><span class="ln">368  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.  What a pity it</span>
<a name="l369"><span class="ln">369  </span></a><span class="s0">is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!&quot;</span>
<a name="l370"><span class="ln">370  </span></a>
<a name="l371"><span class="ln">371  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.  Mr. Weston is such</span>

<a name="l377"><span class="ln">377  </span></a><span class="s0">This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,</span>
<a name="l378"><span class="ln">378  </span></a><span class="s0">my dear.&quot;</span>
<a name="l379"><span class="ln">379  </span></a>
<a name="l380"><span class="ln">380  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see</span>
<a name="l381"><span class="ln">381  </span></a><span class="s0">us!--We shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay</span>
<a name="l382"><span class="ln">382  </span></a><span class="s0">wedding visit very soon.&quot;</span>
<a name="l383"><span class="ln">383  </span></a>
<a name="l384"><span class="ln">384  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance.</span>
<a name="l385"><span class="ln">385  </span></a><span class="s0">I could not walk half so far.&quot;</span>
<a name="l386"><span class="ln">386  </span></a>
<a name="l387"><span class="ln">387  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.  We must go in the carriage,</span>
<a name="l388"><span class="ln">388  </span></a><span class="s0">to be sure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l389"><span class="ln">389  </span></a>
<a name="l390"><span class="ln">390  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for</span>
<a name="l391"><span class="ln">391  </span></a><span class="s0">such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we</span>
<a name="l392"><span class="ln">392  </span></a><span class="s0">are paying our visit?&quot;</span>
<a name="l393"><span class="ln">393  </span></a>
<a name="l394"><span class="ln">394  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa.  You know we</span>
<a name="l395"><span class="ln">395  </span></a><span class="s0">have settled all that already.  We talked it all over with Mr. Weston</span>
<a name="l396"><span class="ln">396  </span></a><span class="s0">last night.  And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like</span>
<a name="l397"><span class="ln">397  </span></a><span class="s0">going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there.</span>
<a name="l398"><span class="ln">398  </span></a><span class="s0">I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.  That was</span>
<a name="l399"><span class="ln">399  </span></a><span class="s0">your doing, papa.  You got Hannah that good place.  Nobody thought</span>
<a name="l400"><span class="ln">400  </span></a><span class="s0">of Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!&quot;</span>
<a name="l401"><span class="ln">401  </span></a>
<a name="l402"><span class="ln">402  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am very glad I did think of her.  It was very lucky, for I would</span>
<a name="l403"><span class="ln">403  </span></a><span class="s0">not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account;</span>
<a name="l404"><span class="ln">404  </span></a><span class="s0">and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,</span>
<a name="l405"><span class="ln">405  </span></a><span class="s0">pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.  Whenever I see her,</span>
<a name="l406"><span class="ln">406  </span></a><span class="s0">she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;</span>
<a name="l407"><span class="ln">407  </span></a><span class="s0">and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she</span>
<a name="l408"><span class="ln">408  </span></a><span class="s0">always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.</span>
<a name="l409"><span class="ln">409  </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great</span>
<a name="l410"><span class="ln">410  </span></a><span class="s0">comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is</span>
<a name="l411"><span class="ln">411  </span></a><span class="s0">used to see.  Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know,</span>
<a name="l412"><span class="ln">412  </span></a><span class="s0">she will be hearing of us.  He will be able to tell her how we</span>
<a name="l413"><span class="ln">413  </span></a><span class="s0">all are.&quot;</span>
<a name="l414"><span class="ln">414  </span></a>
<a name="l415"><span class="ln">415  </span></a><span class="s0">Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,</span>
<a name="l416"><span class="ln">416  </span></a><span class="s0">and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably</span>
<a name="l417"><span class="ln">417  </span></a><span class="s0">through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.</span>
<a name="l418"><span class="ln">418  </span></a><span class="s0">The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards</span>
<a name="l419"><span class="ln">419  </span></a><span class="s0">walked in and made it unnecessary.</span>
<a name="l420"><span class="ln">420  </span></a>
<a name="l421"><span class="ln">421  </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not</span>
<a name="l422"><span class="ln">422  </span></a><span class="s0">only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly</span>
<a name="l423"><span class="ln">423  </span></a><span class="s0">connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.</span>
<a name="l424"><span class="ln">424  </span></a><span class="s0">He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,</span>
<a name="l425"><span class="ln">425  </span></a><span class="s0">and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,</span>
<a name="l426"><span class="ln">426  </span></a><span class="s0">as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.  He had</span>
<a name="l427"><span class="ln">427  </span></a><span class="s0">returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked</span>
<a name="l428"><span class="ln">428  </span></a><span class="s0">up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.</span>
<a name="l429"><span class="ln">429  </span></a><span class="s0">It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.</span>
<a name="l430"><span class="ln">430  </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;</span>
<a name="l431"><span class="ln">431  </span></a><span class="s0">and his many inquiries after &quot;poor Isabella&quot; and her children were</span>
<a name="l432"><span class="ln">432  </span></a><span class="s0">answered most satisfactorily.  When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l433"><span class="ln">433  </span></a><span class="s0">gratefully observed, &quot;It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come</span>
<a name="l434"><span class="ln">434  </span></a><span class="s0">out at this late hour to call upon us.  I am afraid you must have</span>
<a name="l435"><span class="ln">435  </span></a><span class="s0">had a shocking walk.&quot;</span>
<a name="l436"><span class="ln">436  </span></a>
<a name="l437"><span class="ln">437  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not at all, sir.  It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild</span>
<a name="l438"><span class="ln">438  </span></a><span class="s0">that I must draw back from your great fire.&quot;</span>
<a name="l439"><span class="ln">439  </span></a>
<a name="l440"><span class="ln">440  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But you must have found it very damp and dirty.  I wish you may</span>
<a name="l441"><span class="ln">441  </span></a><span class="s0">not catch cold.&quot;</span>
<a name="l442"><span class="ln">442  </span></a>
<a name="l443"><span class="ln">443  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes.  Not a speck on them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l444"><span class="ln">444  </span></a>
<a name="l445"><span class="ln">445  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal</span>
<a name="l446"><span class="ln">446  </span></a><span class="s0">of rain here.  It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour</span>
<a name="l447"><span class="ln">447  </span></a><span class="s0">while we were at breakfast.  I wanted them to put off the wedding.&quot;</span>
<a name="l448"><span class="ln">448  </span></a>
<a name="l449"><span class="ln">449  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;By the bye--I have not wished you joy.  Being pretty well aware</span>
<a name="l450"><span class="ln">450  </span></a><span class="s0">of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry</span>
<a name="l451"><span class="ln">451  </span></a><span class="s0">with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.</span>
<a name="l452"><span class="ln">452  </span></a><span class="s0">How did you all behave? Who cried most?&quot;</span>
<a name="l453"><span class="ln">453  </span></a>
<a name="l454"><span class="ln">454  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business.&quot;</span>
<a name="l455"><span class="ln">455  </span></a>
<a name="l456"><span class="ln">456  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly</span>
<a name="l457"><span class="ln">457  </span></a><span class="s0">say `poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma;</span>
<a name="l458"><span class="ln">458  </span></a><span class="s0">but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At</span>
<a name="l459"><span class="ln">459  </span></a><span class="s0">any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.&quot;</span>
<a name="l460"><span class="ln">460  </span></a>
<a name="l461"><span class="ln">461  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!&quot;</span>
<a name="l462"><span class="ln">462  </span></a><span class="s0">said Emma playfully.  &quot;That is what you have in your head,</span>
<a name="l463"><span class="ln">463  </span></a><span class="s0">I know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.&quot;</span>
<a name="l464"><span class="ln">464  </span></a>
<a name="l465"><span class="ln">465  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l466"><span class="ln">466  </span></a><span class="s0">with a sigh.  &quot;I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.&quot;</span>
<a name="l467"><span class="ln">467  </span></a>
<a name="l468"><span class="ln">468  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose</span>
<a name="l469"><span class="ln">469  </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley to mean _you_.  What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant</span>
<a name="l470"><span class="ln">470  </span></a><span class="s0">only myself.  Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--</span>
<a name="l471"><span class="ln">471  </span></a><span class="s0">in a joke--it is all a joke.  We always say what we like to one another.&quot;</span>
<a name="l472"><span class="ln">472  </span></a>
<a name="l473"><span class="ln">473  </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see</span>
<a name="l474"><span class="ln">474  </span></a><span class="s0">faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:</span>
<a name="l475"><span class="ln">475  </span></a><span class="s0">and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself,</span>
<a name="l476"><span class="ln">476  </span></a><span class="s0">she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would</span>
<a name="l477"><span class="ln">477  </span></a><span class="s0">not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being</span>
<a name="l478"><span class="ln">478  </span></a><span class="s0">thought perfect by every body.</span>
<a name="l479"><span class="ln">479  </span></a>
<a name="l480"><span class="ln">480  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Emma knows I never flatter her,&quot; said Mr. Knightley, &quot;but I</span>
<a name="l481"><span class="ln">481  </span></a><span class="s0">meant no reflection on any body.  Miss Taylor has been used</span>
<a name="l482"><span class="ln">482  </span></a><span class="s0">to have two persons to please; she will now have but one.</span>
<a name="l483"><span class="ln">483  </span></a><span class="s0">The chances are that she must be a gainer.&quot;</span>
<a name="l484"><span class="ln">484  </span></a>
<a name="l485"><span class="ln">485  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said Emma, willing to let it pass--&quot;you want to hear</span>
<a name="l486"><span class="ln">486  </span></a><span class="s0">about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all</span>
<a name="l487"><span class="ln">487  </span></a><span class="s0">behaved charmingly.  Every body was punctual, every body in their</span>
<a name="l488"><span class="ln">488  </span></a><span class="s0">best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.  Oh no;</span>
<a name="l489"><span class="ln">489  </span></a><span class="s0">we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart,</span>
<a name="l490"><span class="ln">490  </span></a><span class="s0">and were sure of meeting every day.&quot;</span>
<a name="l491"><span class="ln">491  </span></a>
<a name="l492"><span class="ln">492  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Dear Emma bears every thing so well,&quot; said her father.</span>
<a name="l493"><span class="ln">493  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor,</span>
<a name="l494"><span class="ln">494  </span></a><span class="s0">and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.&quot;</span>
<a name="l495"><span class="ln">495  </span></a>
<a name="l496"><span class="ln">496  </span></a><span class="s0">Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.</span>
<a name="l497"><span class="ln">497  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,&quot;</span>
<a name="l498"><span class="ln">498  </span></a><span class="s0">said Mr. Knightley.  &quot;We should not like her so well as we do, sir,</span>
<a name="l499"><span class="ln">499  </span></a><span class="s0">if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to</span>
<a name="l500"><span class="ln">500  </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Taylor's advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be,</span>
<a name="l501"><span class="ln">501  </span></a><span class="s0">at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her own,</span>
<a name="l502"><span class="ln">502  </span></a><span class="s0">and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision,</span>
<a name="l503"><span class="ln">503  </span></a><span class="s0">and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.</span>
<a name="l504"><span class="ln">504  </span></a><span class="s0">Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily</span>
<a name="l505"><span class="ln">505  </span></a><span class="s0">married.&quot;</span>
<a name="l506"><span class="ln">506  </span></a>
<a name="l507"><span class="ln">507  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,&quot; said Emma,</span>
<a name="l508"><span class="ln">508  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.</span>
<a name="l509"><span class="ln">509  </span></a><span class="s0">I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place,</span>
<a name="l510"><span class="ln">510  </span></a><span class="s0">and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would</span>
<a name="l511"><span class="ln">511  </span></a><span class="s0">never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l512"><span class="ln">512  </span></a>
<a name="l513"><span class="ln">513  </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley shook his head at her.  Her father fondly replied,</span>
<a name="l514"><span class="ln">514  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things,</span>
<a name="l515"><span class="ln">515  </span></a><span class="s0">for whatever you say always comes to pass.  Pray do not make any</span>
<a name="l516"><span class="ln">516  </span></a><span class="s0">more matches.&quot;</span>
<a name="l517"><span class="ln">517  </span></a>
<a name="l518"><span class="ln">518  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,</span>
<a name="l519"><span class="ln">519  </span></a><span class="s0">for other people.  It is the greatest amusement in the world! And</span>
<a name="l520"><span class="ln">520  </span></a><span class="s0">after such success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would</span>
<a name="l521"><span class="ln">521  </span></a><span class="s0">never marry again.  Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower</span>
<a name="l522"><span class="ln">522  </span></a><span class="s0">so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife,</span>
<a name="l523"><span class="ln">523  </span></a><span class="s0">so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his</span>
<a name="l524"><span class="ln">524  </span></a><span class="s0">friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--</span>
<a name="l525"><span class="ln">525  </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did</span>
<a name="l526"><span class="ln">526  </span></a><span class="s0">not like it.  Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.</span>
<a name="l527"><span class="ln">527  </span></a><span class="s0">Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed,</span>
<a name="l528"><span class="ln">528  </span></a><span class="s0">and others of the son and the uncle not letting him.  All manner</span>
<a name="l529"><span class="ln">529  </span></a><span class="s0">of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none</span>
<a name="l530"><span class="ln">530  </span></a><span class="s0">of it.</span>
<a name="l531"><span class="ln">531  </span></a>
<a name="l532"><span class="ln">532  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I</span>
<a name="l533"><span class="ln">533  </span></a><span class="s0">met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,</span>
<a name="l534"><span class="ln">534  </span></a><span class="s0">he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas</span>
<a name="l535"><span class="ln">535  </span></a><span class="s0">for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject.</span>
<a name="l536"><span class="ln">536  </span></a><span class="s0">I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed</span>
<a name="l537"><span class="ln">537  </span></a><span class="s0">me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave</span>
<a name="l538"><span class="ln">538  </span></a><span class="s0">off match-making.&quot;</span>
<a name="l539"><span class="ln">539  </span></a>
<a name="l540"><span class="ln">540  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not understand what you mean by `success,'&quot; said Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l541"><span class="ln">541  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Success supposes endeavour.  Your time has been properly and</span>
<a name="l542"><span class="ln">542  </span></a><span class="s0">delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four</span>
<a name="l543"><span class="ln">543  </span></a><span class="s0">years to bring about this marriage.  A worthy employment for a young</span>
<a name="l544"><span class="ln">544  </span></a><span class="s0">lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match,</span>
<a name="l545"><span class="ln">545  </span></a><span class="s0">as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself</span>
<a name="l546"><span class="ln">546  </span></a><span class="s0">one idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor</span>
<a name="l547"><span class="ln">547  </span></a><span class="s0">if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself</span>
<a name="l548"><span class="ln">548  </span></a><span class="s0">every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where</span>
<a name="l549"><span class="ln">549  </span></a><span class="s0">is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess;</span>
<a name="l550"><span class="ln">550  </span></a><span class="s0">and _that_ is all that can be said.&quot;</span>
<a name="l551"><span class="ln">551  </span></a>
<a name="l552"><span class="ln">552  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--</span>
<a name="l553"><span class="ln">553  </span></a><span class="s0">I pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky</span>
<a name="l554"><span class="ln">554  </span></a><span class="s0">guess is never merely luck.  There is always some talent in it.</span>
<a name="l555"><span class="ln">555  </span></a><span class="s0">And as to my poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not</span>
<a name="l556"><span class="ln">556  </span></a><span class="s0">know that I am so entirely without any claim to it.  You have drawn</span>
<a name="l557"><span class="ln">557  </span></a><span class="s0">two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something</span>
<a name="l558"><span class="ln">558  </span></a><span class="s0">between the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's</span>
<a name="l559"><span class="ln">559  </span></a><span class="s0">visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed</span>
<a name="l560"><span class="ln">560  </span></a><span class="s0">many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.</span>
<a name="l561"><span class="ln">561  </span></a><span class="s0">I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.&quot;</span>
<a name="l562"><span class="ln">562  </span></a>
<a name="l563"><span class="ln">563  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,</span>
<a name="l564"><span class="ln">564  </span></a><span class="s0">unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their</span>
<a name="l565"><span class="ln">565  </span></a><span class="s0">own concerns.  You are more likely to have done harm to yourself,</span>
<a name="l566"><span class="ln">566  </span></a><span class="s0">than good to them, by interference.&quot;</span>
<a name="l567"><span class="ln">567  </span></a>
<a name="l568"><span class="ln">568  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,&quot;</span>
<a name="l569"><span class="ln">569  </span></a><span class="s0">rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.  &quot;But, my dear,</span>
<a name="l570"><span class="ln">570  </span></a><span class="s0">pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up</span>
<a name="l571"><span class="ln">571  </span></a><span class="s0">one's family circle grievously.&quot;</span>
<a name="l572"><span class="ln">572  </span></a>
<a name="l573"><span class="ln">573  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton.  Poor Mr. Elton! You</span>
<a name="l574"><span class="ln">574  </span></a><span class="s0">like Mr. Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him.</span>
<a name="l575"><span class="ln">575  </span></a><span class="s0">There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him--and he has been</span>
<a name="l576"><span class="ln">576  </span></a><span class="s0">here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably,</span>
<a name="l577"><span class="ln">577  </span></a><span class="s0">that it would be a shame to have him single any longer--and I thought</span>
<a name="l578"><span class="ln">578  </span></a><span class="s0">when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if</span>
<a name="l579"><span class="ln">579  </span></a><span class="s0">he would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think</span>
<a name="l580"><span class="ln">580  </span></a><span class="s0">very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing</span>
<a name="l581"><span class="ln">581  </span></a><span class="s0">him a service.&quot;</span>
<a name="l582"><span class="ln">582  </span></a>
<a name="l583"><span class="ln">583  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very</span>
<a name="l584"><span class="ln">584  </span></a><span class="s0">good young man, and I have a great regard for him.  But if you</span>
<a name="l585"><span class="ln">585  </span></a><span class="s0">want to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come</span>
<a name="l586"><span class="ln">586  </span></a><span class="s0">and dine with us some day.  That will be a much better thing.</span>
<a name="l587"><span class="ln">587  </span></a><span class="s0">I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l588"><span class="ln">588  </span></a>
<a name="l589"><span class="ln">589  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,&quot; said Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l590"><span class="ln">590  </span></a><span class="s0">laughing, &quot;and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much</span>
<a name="l591"><span class="ln">591  </span></a><span class="s0">better thing.  Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best</span>
<a name="l592"><span class="ln">592  </span></a><span class="s0">of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.</span>
<a name="l593"><span class="ln">593  </span></a><span class="s0">Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care</span>
<a name="l594"><span class="ln">594  </span></a><span class="s0">of himself.&quot;</span>

<a name="l598"><span class="ln">598  </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>
<a name="l599"><span class="ln">599  </span></a>
<a name="l600"><span class="ln">600  </span></a>
<a name="l601"><span class="ln">601  </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,</span>
<a name="l602"><span class="ln">602  </span></a><span class="s0">which for the last two or three generations had been rising into</span>
<a name="l603"><span class="ln">603  </span></a><span class="s0">gentility and property.  He had received a good education, but,</span>
<a name="l604"><span class="ln">604  </span></a><span class="s0">on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become</span>
<a name="l605"><span class="ln">605  </span></a><span class="s0">indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers</span>
<a name="l606"><span class="ln">606  </span></a><span class="s0">were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social</span>
<a name="l607"><span class="ln">607  </span></a><span class="s0">temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.</span>
<a name="l608"><span class="ln">608  </span></a>
<a name="l609"><span class="ln">609  </span></a><span class="s0">Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances</span>
<a name="l610"><span class="ln">610  </span></a><span class="s0">of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,</span>
<a name="l611"><span class="ln">611  </span></a><span class="s0">of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love</span>
<a name="l612"><span class="ln">612  </span></a><span class="s0">with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,</span>
<a name="l613"><span class="ln">613  </span></a><span class="s0">who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,</span>
<a name="l614"><span class="ln">614  </span></a><span class="s0">which the connexion would offend.</span>
<a name="l615"><span class="ln">615  </span></a>
<a name="l616"><span class="ln">616  </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command</span>
<a name="l617"><span class="ln">617  </span></a><span class="s0">of her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the</span>
<a name="l618"><span class="ln">618  </span></a><span class="s0">family-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it</span>
<a name="l619"><span class="ln">619  </span></a><span class="s0">took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,</span>
<a name="l620"><span class="ln">620  </span></a><span class="s0">who threw her off with due decorum.  It was an unsuitable connexion,</span>
<a name="l621"><span class="ln">621  </span></a><span class="s0">and did not produce much happiness.  Mrs. Weston ought to have found</span>
<a name="l622"><span class="ln">622  </span></a><span class="s0">more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper</span>
<a name="l623"><span class="ln">623  </span></a><span class="s0">made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness</span>
<a name="l624"><span class="ln">624  </span></a><span class="s0">of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,</span>
<a name="l625"><span class="ln">625  </span></a><span class="s0">she had not the best.  She had resolution enough to pursue</span>
<a name="l626"><span class="ln">626  </span></a><span class="s0">her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain</span>
<a name="l627"><span class="ln">627  </span></a><span class="s0">from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger,</span>
<a name="l628"><span class="ln">628  </span></a><span class="s0">nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.  They lived beyond</span>
<a name="l629"><span class="ln">629  </span></a><span class="s0">their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:</span>
<a name="l630"><span class="ln">630  </span></a><span class="s0">she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once</span>
<a name="l631"><span class="ln">631  </span></a><span class="s0">to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.</span>
<a name="l632"><span class="ln">632  </span></a>
<a name="l633"><span class="ln">633  </span></a><span class="s0">Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,</span>
<a name="l634"><span class="ln">634  </span></a><span class="s0">as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst</span>
<a name="l635"><span class="ln">635  </span></a><span class="s0">of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage,</span>
<a name="l636"><span class="ln">636  </span></a><span class="s0">he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.</span>
<a name="l637"><span class="ln">637  </span></a><span class="s0">From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.</span>
<a name="l638"><span class="ln">638  </span></a><span class="s0">The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering</span>
<a name="l639"><span class="ln">639  </span></a><span class="s0">illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;</span>
<a name="l640"><span class="ln">640  </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,</span>
<a name="l641"><span class="ln">641  </span></a><span class="s0">nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to</span>
<a name="l642"><span class="ln">642  </span></a><span class="s0">take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.</span>
<a name="l643"><span class="ln">643  </span></a><span class="s0">Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed</span>
<a name="l644"><span class="ln">644  </span></a><span class="s0">to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,</span>
<a name="l645"><span class="ln">645  </span></a><span class="s0">the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,</span>
<a name="l646"><span class="ln">646  </span></a><span class="s0">and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to</span>
<a name="l647"><span class="ln">647  </span></a><span class="s0">improve as he could.</span>
<a name="l648"><span class="ln">648  </span></a>
<a name="l649"><span class="ln">649  </span></a><span class="s0">A complete change of life became desirable.  He quitted the militia</span>
<a name="l650"><span class="ln">650  </span></a><span class="s0">and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a</span>
<a name="l651"><span class="ln">651  </span></a><span class="s0">good way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.</span>
<a name="l652"><span class="ln">652  </span></a><span class="s0">It was a concern which brought just employment enough.  He had still</span>
<a name="l653"><span class="ln">653  </span></a><span class="s0">a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;</span>
<a name="l654"><span class="ln">654  </span></a><span class="s0">and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,</span>
<a name="l655"><span class="ln">655  </span></a><span class="s0">the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.</span>
<a name="l656"><span class="ln">656  </span></a><span class="s0">He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure</span>
<a name="l657"><span class="ln">657  </span></a><span class="s0">the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had</span>
<a name="l658"><span class="ln">658  </span></a><span class="s0">always longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even</span>
<a name="l659"><span class="ln">659  </span></a><span class="s0">as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own</span>
<a name="l660"><span class="ln">660  </span></a><span class="s0">friendly and social disposition.</span>
<a name="l661"><span class="ln">661  </span></a>
<a name="l662"><span class="ln">662  </span></a><span class="s0">It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence</span>
<a name="l663"><span class="ln">663  </span></a><span class="s0">his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth</span>
<a name="l664"><span class="ln">664  </span></a><span class="s0">on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling</span>
<a name="l665"><span class="ln">665  </span></a><span class="s0">till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long</span>
<a name="l666"><span class="ln">666  </span></a><span class="s0">looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects</span>
<a name="l667"><span class="ln">667  </span></a><span class="s0">in view, till they were accomplished.  He had made his fortune,</span>
<a name="l668"><span class="ln">668  </span></a><span class="s0">bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new</span>
<a name="l669"><span class="ln">669  </span></a><span class="s0">period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness</span>
<a name="l670"><span class="ln">670  </span></a><span class="s0">than in any yet passed through.  He had never been an unhappy man;</span>
<a name="l671"><span class="ln">671  </span></a><span class="s0">his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;</span>
<a name="l672"><span class="ln">672  </span></a><span class="s0">but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly</span>
<a name="l673"><span class="ln">673  </span></a><span class="s0">amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof</span>
<a name="l674"><span class="ln">674  </span></a><span class="s0">of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,</span>
<a name="l675"><span class="ln">675  </span></a><span class="s0">to excite gratitude than to feel it.</span>
<a name="l676"><span class="ln">676  </span></a>
<a name="l677"><span class="ln">677  </span></a><span class="s0">He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was</span>
<a name="l678"><span class="ln">678  </span></a><span class="s0">his own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought</span>
<a name="l679"><span class="ln">679  </span></a><span class="s0">up as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption</span>
<a name="l680"><span class="ln">680  </span></a><span class="s0">as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.</span>
<a name="l681"><span class="ln">681  </span></a><span class="s0">It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his</span>
<a name="l682"><span class="ln">682  </span></a><span class="s0">father's assistance.  His father had no apprehension of it.</span>
<a name="l683"><span class="ln">683  </span></a><span class="s0">The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;</span>
<a name="l684"><span class="ln">684  </span></a><span class="s0">but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice</span>
<a name="l685"><span class="ln">685  </span></a><span class="s0">could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,</span>
<a name="l686"><span class="ln">686  </span></a><span class="s0">so deservedly dear.  He saw his son every year in London,</span>
<a name="l687"><span class="ln">687  </span></a><span class="s0">and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine</span>
<a name="l688"><span class="ln">688  </span></a><span class="s0">young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.</span>
<a name="l689"><span class="ln">689  </span></a><span class="s0">He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his</span>
<a name="l690"><span class="ln">690  </span></a><span class="s0">merits and prospects a kind of common concern.</span>
<a name="l691"><span class="ln">691  </span></a>
<a name="l692"><span class="ln">692  </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively</span>
<a name="l693"><span class="ln">693  </span></a><span class="s0">curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little</span>
<a name="l694"><span class="ln">694  </span></a><span class="s0">returned that he had never been there in his life.  His coming</span>
<a name="l695"><span class="ln">695  </span></a><span class="s0">to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.</span>
<a name="l696"><span class="ln">696  </span></a>
<a name="l697"><span class="ln">697  </span></a><span class="s0">Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed,</span>
<a name="l698"><span class="ln">698  </span></a><span class="s0">as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.</span>
<a name="l699"><span class="ln">699  </span></a><span class="s0">There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when</span>
<a name="l700"><span class="ln">700  </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and</span>
<a name="l701"><span class="ln">701  </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates returned the visit.  Now was the time for Mr. Frank</span>
<a name="l702"><span class="ln">702  </span></a><span class="s0">Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was</span>
<a name="l703"><span class="ln">703  </span></a><span class="s0">understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.</span>
<a name="l704"><span class="ln">704  </span></a><span class="s0">For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention</span>
<a name="l705"><span class="ln">705  </span></a><span class="s0">of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.  &quot;I suppose you</span>
<a name="l706"><span class="ln">706  </span></a><span class="s0">have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written</span>
<a name="l707"><span class="ln">707  </span></a><span class="s0">to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.</span>
<a name="l708"><span class="ln">708  </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.  Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he</span>
<a name="l709"><span class="ln">709  </span></a><span class="s0">says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.&quot;</span>
<a name="l710"><span class="ln">710  </span></a>
<a name="l711"><span class="ln">711  </span></a><span class="s0">It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.  Mrs. Weston had, of course,</span>
<a name="l712"><span class="ln">712  </span></a><span class="s0">formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing</span>
<a name="l713"><span class="ln">713  </span></a><span class="s0">attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense,</span>
<a name="l714"><span class="ln">714  </span></a><span class="s0">and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression</span>
<a name="l715"><span class="ln">715  </span></a><span class="s0">of congratulation which her marriage had already secured.  She felt</span>
<a name="l716"><span class="ln">716  </span></a><span class="s0">herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough</span>
<a name="l717"><span class="ln">717  </span></a><span class="s0">to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only</span>
<a name="l718"><span class="ln">718  </span></a><span class="s0">regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship</span>
<a name="l719"><span class="ln">719  </span></a><span class="s0">for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.</span>
<a name="l720"><span class="ln">720  </span></a>
<a name="l721"><span class="ln">721  </span></a><span class="s0">She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,</span>
<a name="l722"><span class="ln">722  </span></a><span class="s0">without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering</span>
<a name="l723"><span class="ln">723  </span></a><span class="s0">an hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear</span>
<a name="l724"><span class="ln">724  </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation</span>
<a name="l725"><span class="ln">725  </span></a><span class="s0">than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy,</span>
<a name="l726"><span class="ln">726  </span></a><span class="s0">and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily</span>
<a name="l727"><span class="ln">727  </span></a><span class="s0">through its little difficulties and privations.  And then there was</span>
<a name="l728"><span class="ln">728  </span></a><span class="s0">such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l729"><span class="ln">729  </span></a><span class="s0">so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's</span>
<a name="l730"><span class="ln">730  </span></a><span class="s0">disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching</span>
<a name="l731"><span class="ln">731  </span></a><span class="s0">season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the</span>
<a name="l732"><span class="ln">732  </span></a><span class="s0">week together.</span>
<a name="l733"><span class="ln">733  </span></a>
<a name="l734"><span class="ln">734  </span></a><span class="s0">Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude</span>
<a name="l735"><span class="ln">735  </span></a><span class="s0">to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her</span>
<a name="l736"><span class="ln">736  </span></a><span class="s0">satisfaction--her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment,</span>
<a name="l737"><span class="ln">737  </span></a><span class="s0">was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father,</span>
<a name="l738"><span class="ln">738  </span></a><span class="s0">was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity</span>
<a name="l739"><span class="ln">739  </span></a><span class="s0">`poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre</span>
<a name="l740"><span class="ln">740  </span></a><span class="s0">of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening</span>
<a name="l741"><span class="ln">741  </span></a><span class="s0">attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own.</span>
<a name="l742"><span class="ln">742  </span></a><span class="s0">But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,</span>
<a name="l743"><span class="ln">743  </span></a><span class="s0">and saying, &quot;Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.&quot;</span>
<a name="l744"><span class="ln">744  </span></a>
<a name="l745"><span class="ln">745  </span></a><span class="s0">There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of</span>
<a name="l746"><span class="ln">746  </span></a><span class="s0">ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation</span>
<a name="l747"><span class="ln">747  </span></a><span class="s0">to Mr. Woodhouse.  The compliments of his neighbours were over;</span>
<a name="l748"><span class="ln">748  </span></a><span class="s0">he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event;</span>
<a name="l749"><span class="ln">749  </span></a><span class="s0">and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him,</span>
<a name="l750"><span class="ln">750  </span></a><span class="s0">was all eat up.  His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he</span>
<a name="l751"><span class="ln">751  </span></a><span class="s0">could never believe other people to be different from himself.</span>
<a name="l752"><span class="ln">752  </span></a><span class="s0">What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;</span>
<a name="l753"><span class="ln">753  </span></a><span class="s0">and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having</span>
<a name="l754"><span class="ln">754  </span></a><span class="s0">any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly</span>
<a name="l755"><span class="ln">755  </span></a><span class="s0">tried to prevent any body's eating it.  He had been at the pains</span>
<a name="l756"><span class="ln">756  </span></a><span class="s0">of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.  Mr. Perry</span>
<a name="l757"><span class="ln">757  </span></a><span class="s0">was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one</span>
<a name="l758"><span class="ln">758  </span></a><span class="s0">of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,</span>
<a name="l759"><span class="ln">759  </span></a><span class="s0">he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the</span>
<a name="l760"><span class="ln">760  </span></a><span class="s0">bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree</span>
<a name="l761"><span class="ln">761  </span></a><span class="s0">with many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.</span>
<a name="l762"><span class="ln">762  </span></a><span class="s0">With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped</span>
<a name="l763"><span class="ln">763  </span></a><span class="s0">to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the</span>
<a name="l764"><span class="ln">764  </span></a><span class="s0">cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till</span>
<a name="l765"><span class="ln">765  </span></a><span class="s0">it was all gone.</span>
<a name="l766"><span class="ln">766  </span></a>
<a name="l767"><span class="ln">767  </span></a><span class="s0">There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys</span>
<a name="l768"><span class="ln">768  </span></a><span class="s0">being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their</span>
<a name="l769"><span class="ln">769  </span></a><span class="s0">hands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.</span>
<a name="l770"><span class="ln">770  </span></a>
<a name="l771"><span class="ln">771  </span></a>
<a name="l772"><span class="ln">772  </span></a>
<a name="l773"><span class="ln">773  </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>
<a name="l774"><span class="ln">774  </span></a>
<a name="l775"><span class="ln">775  </span></a>
<a name="l776"><span class="ln">776  </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.  He liked very much</span>
<a name="l777"><span class="ln">777  </span></a><span class="s0">to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,</span>
<a name="l778"><span class="ln">778  </span></a><span class="s0">from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature,</span>
<a name="l779"><span class="ln">779  </span></a><span class="s0">from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the</span>
<a name="l780"><span class="ln">780  </span></a><span class="s0">visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.</span>
<a name="l781"><span class="ln">781  </span></a><span class="s0">He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle;</span>
<a name="l782"><span class="ln">782  </span></a><span class="s0">his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit</span>
<a name="l783"><span class="ln">783  </span></a><span class="s0">for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.</span>
<a name="l784"><span class="ln">784  </span></a><span class="s0">Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,</span>
<a name="l785"><span class="ln">785  </span></a><span class="s0">and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l786"><span class="ln">786  </span></a><span class="s0">comprehended many such.  Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion,</span>
<a name="l787"><span class="ln">787  </span></a><span class="s0">he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening</span>
<a name="l788"><span class="ln">788  </span></a><span class="s0">parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any</span>
<a name="l789"><span class="ln">789  </span></a><span class="s0">time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week</span>
<a name="l790"><span class="ln">790  </span></a><span class="s0">in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.</span>
<a name="l791"><span class="ln">791  </span></a>
<a name="l792"><span class="ln">792  </span></a><span class="s0">Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;</span>
<a name="l793"><span class="ln">793  </span></a><span class="s0">and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it,</span>
<a name="l794"><span class="ln">794  </span></a><span class="s0">the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude</span>
<a name="l795"><span class="ln">795  </span></a><span class="s0">for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room,</span>
<a name="l796"><span class="ln">796  </span></a><span class="s0">and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being</span>
<a name="l797"><span class="ln">797  </span></a><span class="s0">thrown away.</span>
<a name="l798"><span class="ln">798  </span></a>
<a name="l799"><span class="ln">799  </span></a><span class="s0">After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able</span>
<a name="l800"><span class="ln">800  </span></a><span class="s0">of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies</span>
<a name="l801"><span class="ln">801  </span></a><span class="s0">almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l802"><span class="ln">802  </span></a><span class="s0">and who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l803"><span class="ln">803  </span></a><span class="s0">thought it no hardship for either James or the horses.  Had it</span>
<a name="l804"><span class="ln">804  </span></a><span class="s0">taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.</span>
<a name="l805"><span class="ln">805  </span></a>
<a name="l806"><span class="ln">806  </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a</span>
<a name="l807"><span class="ln">807  </span></a><span class="s0">very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.</span>
<a name="l808"><span class="ln">808  </span></a><span class="s0">She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was</span>
<a name="l809"><span class="ln">809  </span></a><span class="s0">considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady,</span>
<a name="l810"><span class="ln">810  </span></a><span class="s0">under such untoward circumstances, can excite.  Her daughter enjoyed</span>
<a name="l811"><span class="ln">811  </span></a><span class="s0">a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young,</span>
<a name="l812"><span class="ln">812  </span></a><span class="s0">handsome, rich, nor married.  Miss Bates stood in the very worst</span>
<a name="l813"><span class="ln">813  </span></a><span class="s0">predicament in the world for having much of the public favour;</span>
<a name="l814"><span class="ln">814  </span></a><span class="s0">and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself,</span>
<a name="l815"><span class="ln">815  </span></a><span class="s0">or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.</span>
<a name="l816"><span class="ln">816  </span></a><span class="s0">She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.  Her youth</span>
<a name="l817"><span class="ln">817  </span></a><span class="s0">had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted</span>
<a name="l818"><span class="ln">818  </span></a><span class="s0">to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small</span>
<a name="l819"><span class="ln">819  </span></a><span class="s0">income go as far as possible.  And yet she was a happy woman,</span>
<a name="l820"><span class="ln">820  </span></a><span class="s0">and a woman whom no one named without good-will.  It was her own</span>
<a name="l821"><span class="ln">821  </span></a><span class="s0">universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.</span>
<a name="l822"><span class="ln">822  </span></a><span class="s0">She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness,</span>
<a name="l823"><span class="ln">823  </span></a><span class="s0">quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate</span>
<a name="l824"><span class="ln">824  </span></a><span class="s0">creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother,</span>
<a name="l825"><span class="ln">825  </span></a><span class="s0">and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted</span>
<a name="l826"><span class="ln">826  </span></a><span class="s0">for nothing.  The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature,</span>
<a name="l827"><span class="ln">827  </span></a><span class="s0">her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body,</span>
<a name="l828"><span class="ln">828  </span></a><span class="s0">and a mine of felicity to herself.  She was a great talker upon</span>
<a name="l829"><span class="ln">829  </span></a><span class="s0">little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial</span>
<a name="l830"><span class="ln">830  </span></a><span class="s0">communications and harmless gossip.</span>
<a name="l831"><span class="ln">831  </span></a>
<a name="l832"><span class="ln">832  </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary,</span>
<a name="l833"><span class="ln">833  </span></a><span class="s0">or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of</span>
<a name="l834"><span class="ln">834  </span></a><span class="s0">refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,</span>
<a name="l835"><span class="ln">835  </span></a><span class="s0">upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for</span>
<a name="l836"><span class="ln">836  </span></a><span class="s0">enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but</span>
<a name="l837"><span class="ln">837  </span></a><span class="s0">a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable</span>
<a name="l838"><span class="ln">838  </span></a><span class="s0">quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price,</span>
<a name="l839"><span class="ln">839  </span></a><span class="s0">and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble</span>
<a name="l840"><span class="ln">840  </span></a><span class="s0">themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming</span>
<a name="l841"><span class="ln">841  </span></a><span class="s0">back prodigies.  Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and</span>
<a name="l842"><span class="ln">842  </span></a><span class="s0">very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy</span>
<a name="l843"><span class="ln">843  </span></a><span class="s0">spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty</span>
<a name="l844"><span class="ln">844  </span></a><span class="s0">of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,</span>
<a name="l845"><span class="ln">845  </span></a><span class="s0">and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.</span>
<a name="l846"><span class="ln">846  </span></a><span class="s0">It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked</span>
<a name="l847"><span class="ln">847  </span></a><span class="s0">after her to church.  She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,</span>
<a name="l848"><span class="ln">848  </span></a><span class="s0">who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled</span>
<a name="l849"><span class="ln">849  </span></a><span class="s0">to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly</span>
<a name="l850"><span class="ln">850  </span></a><span class="s0">owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim</span>
<a name="l851"><span class="ln">851  </span></a><span class="s0">on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work,</span>
<a name="l852"><span class="ln">852  </span></a><span class="s0">whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.</span>
<a name="l853"><span class="ln">853  </span></a>
<a name="l854"><span class="ln">854  </span></a><span class="s0">These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently</span>
<a name="l855"><span class="ln">855  </span></a><span class="s0">able to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake,</span>
<a name="l856"><span class="ln">856  </span></a><span class="s0">in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned,</span>
<a name="l857"><span class="ln">857  </span></a><span class="s0">it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.  She was delighted</span>
<a name="l858"><span class="ln">858  </span></a><span class="s0">to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with</span>
<a name="l859"><span class="ln">859  </span></a><span class="s0">herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings</span>
<a name="l860"><span class="ln">860  </span></a><span class="s0">of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent</span>
<a name="l861"><span class="ln">861  </span></a><span class="s0">was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.</span>
<a name="l862"><span class="ln">862  </span></a>
<a name="l863"><span class="ln">863  </span></a><span class="s0">As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close</span>
<a name="l864"><span class="ln">864  </span></a><span class="s0">of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting,</span>
<a name="l865"><span class="ln">865  </span></a><span class="s0">in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her;</span>
<a name="l866"><span class="ln">866  </span></a><span class="s0">a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen,</span>
<a name="l867"><span class="ln">867  </span></a><span class="s0">whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in,</span>
<a name="l868"><span class="ln">868  </span></a><span class="s0">on account of her beauty.  A very gracious invitation was returned,</span>
<a name="l869"><span class="ln">869  </span></a><span class="s0">and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.</span>
<a name="l870"><span class="ln">870  </span></a>
<a name="l871"><span class="ln">871  </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody.  Somebody had</span>
<a name="l872"><span class="ln">872  </span></a><span class="s0">placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school,</span>
<a name="l873"><span class="ln">873  </span></a><span class="s0">and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar</span>
<a name="l874"><span class="ln">874  </span></a><span class="s0">to that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known</span>
<a name="l875"><span class="ln">875  </span></a><span class="s0">of her history.  She had no visible friends but what had been</span>
<a name="l876"><span class="ln">876  </span></a><span class="s0">acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit</span>
<a name="l877"><span class="ln">877  </span></a><span class="s0">in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her.</span>
<a name="l878"><span class="ln">878  </span></a>
<a name="l879"><span class="ln">879  </span></a><span class="s0">She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort</span>
<a name="l880"><span class="ln">880  </span></a><span class="s0">which Emma particularly admired.  She was short, plump, and fair,</span>
<a name="l881"><span class="ln">881  </span></a><span class="s0">with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,</span>
<a name="l882"><span class="ln">882  </span></a><span class="s0">and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,</span>
<a name="l883"><span class="ln">883  </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite</span>
<a name="l884"><span class="ln">884  </span></a><span class="s0">determined to continue the acquaintance.</span>
<a name="l885"><span class="ln">885  </span></a>
<a name="l886"><span class="ln">886  </span></a><span class="s0">She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's</span>
<a name="l887"><span class="ln">887  </span></a><span class="s0">conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not</span>
<a name="l888"><span class="ln">888  </span></a><span class="s0">inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,</span>
<a name="l889"><span class="ln">889  </span></a><span class="s0">shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly</span>
<a name="l890"><span class="ln">890  </span></a><span class="s0">grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly</span>
<a name="l891"><span class="ln">891  </span></a><span class="s0">impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style</span>
<a name="l892"><span class="ln">892  </span></a><span class="s0">to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense,</span>
<a name="l893"><span class="ln">893  </span></a><span class="s0">and deserve encouragement.  Encouragement should be given.</span>
<a name="l894"><span class="ln">894  </span></a><span class="s0">Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be</span>
<a name="l895"><span class="ln">895  </span></a><span class="s0">wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.</span>
<a name="l896"><span class="ln">896  </span></a><span class="s0">The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.</span>
<a name="l897"><span class="ln">897  </span></a><span class="s0">The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort</span>
<a name="l898"><span class="ln">898  </span></a><span class="s0">of people, must be doing her harm.  They were a family of the name</span>
<a name="l899"><span class="ln">899  </span></a><span class="s0">of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm</span>
<a name="l900"><span class="ln">900  </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably,</span>
<a name="l901"><span class="ln">901  </span></a><span class="s0">she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them--but they</span>
<a name="l902"><span class="ln">902  </span></a><span class="s0">must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates</span>
<a name="l903"><span class="ln">903  </span></a><span class="s0">of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance</span>
<a name="l904"><span class="ln">904  </span></a><span class="s0">to be quite perfect.  _She_ would notice her; she would improve her;</span>
<a name="l905"><span class="ln">905  </span></a><span class="s0">she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her</span>
<a name="l906"><span class="ln">906  </span></a><span class="s0">into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.</span>
<a name="l907"><span class="ln">907  </span></a><span class="s0">It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking;</span>
<a name="l908"><span class="ln">908  </span></a><span class="s0">highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.</span>
<a name="l909"><span class="ln">909  </span></a>
<a name="l910"><span class="ln">910  </span></a><span class="s0">She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking</span>
<a name="l911"><span class="ln">911  </span></a><span class="s0">and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that</span>
<a name="l912"><span class="ln">912  </span></a><span class="s0">the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,</span>
<a name="l913"><span class="ln">913  </span></a><span class="s0">which always closed such parties, and for which she had been</span>
<a name="l914"><span class="ln">914  </span></a><span class="s0">used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready,</span>
<a name="l915"><span class="ln">915  </span></a><span class="s0">and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.  With an</span>
<a name="l916"><span class="ln">916  </span></a><span class="s0">alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never</span>
<a name="l917"><span class="ln">917  </span></a><span class="s0">indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively,</span>
<a name="l918"><span class="ln">918  </span></a><span class="s0">with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas,</span>
<a name="l919"><span class="ln">919  </span></a><span class="s0">did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend</span>
<a name="l920"><span class="ln">920  </span></a><span class="s0">the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she</span>
<a name="l921"><span class="ln">921  </span></a><span class="s0">knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.</span>
<a name="l922"><span class="ln">922  </span></a>
<a name="l923"><span class="ln">923  </span></a><span class="s0">Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare.</span>
<a name="l924"><span class="ln">924  </span></a><span class="s0">He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion</span>
<a name="l925"><span class="ln">925  </span></a><span class="s0">of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome</span>
<a name="l926"><span class="ln">926  </span></a><span class="s0">made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his</span>
<a name="l927"><span class="ln">927  </span></a><span class="s0">hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,</span>
<a name="l928"><span class="ln">928  </span></a><span class="s0">his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.</span>
<a name="l929"><span class="ln">929  </span></a>
<a name="l930"><span class="ln">930  </span></a><span class="s0">Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that</span>
<a name="l931"><span class="ln">931  </span></a><span class="s0">he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he</span>
<a name="l932"><span class="ln">932  </span></a><span class="s0">might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing</span>
<a name="l933"><span class="ln">933  </span></a><span class="s0">the nicer things, to say:</span>
<a name="l934"><span class="ln">934  </span></a>
<a name="l935"><span class="ln">935  </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.</span>
<a name="l936"><span class="ln">936  </span></a><span class="s0">An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.  Serle understands boiling</span>
<a name="l937"><span class="ln">937  </span></a><span class="s0">an egg better than any body.  I would not recommend an egg boiled</span>
<a name="l938"><span class="ln">938  </span></a><span class="s0">by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small,</span>
<a name="l939"><span class="ln">939  </span></a><span class="s0">you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.  Miss Bates,</span>
<a name="l940"><span class="ln">940  </span></a><span class="s0">let Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit.</span>
<a name="l941"><span class="ln">941  </span></a><span class="s0">Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome</span>
<a name="l942"><span class="ln">942  </span></a><span class="s0">preserves here.  I do not advise the custard.  Mrs. Goddard, what say</span>
<a name="l943"><span class="ln">943  </span></a><span class="s0">you to _half_ a glass of wine? A _small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler</span>
<a name="l944"><span class="ln">944  </span></a><span class="s0">of water? I do not think it could disagree with you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l945"><span class="ln">945  </span></a>
<a name="l946"><span class="ln">946  </span></a><span class="s0">Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in</span>
<a name="l947"><span class="ln">947  </span></a><span class="s0">a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had</span>
<a name="l948"><span class="ln">948  </span></a><span class="s0">particular pleasure in sending them away happy.  The happiness</span>
<a name="l949"><span class="ln">949  </span></a><span class="s0">of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions.  Miss Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l950"><span class="ln">950  </span></a><span class="s0">was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the</span>
<a name="l951"><span class="ln">951  </span></a><span class="s0">introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble,</span>
<a name="l952"><span class="ln">952  </span></a><span class="s0">grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings,</span>
<a name="l953"><span class="ln">953  </span></a><span class="s0">delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated</span>
<a name="l954"><span class="ln">954  </span></a><span class="s0">her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!</span>
<a name="l955"><span class="ln">955  </span></a>
<a name="l956"><span class="ln">956  </span></a>
<a name="l957"><span class="ln">957  </span></a>
<a name="l958"><span class="ln">958  </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>
<a name="l959"><span class="ln">959  </span></a>
<a name="l960"><span class="ln">960  </span></a>
<a name="l961"><span class="ln">961  </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.</span>
<a name="l962"><span class="ln">962  </span></a><span class="s0">Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,</span>
<a name="l963"><span class="ln">963  </span></a><span class="s0">and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased,</span>
<a name="l964"><span class="ln">964  </span></a><span class="s0">so did their satisfaction in each other.  As a walking companion,</span>
<a name="l965"><span class="ln">965  </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.</span>
<a name="l966"><span class="ln">966  </span></a><span class="s0">In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important.  Her father</span>
<a name="l967"><span class="ln">967  </span></a><span class="s0">never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground</span>
<a name="l968"><span class="ln">968  </span></a><span class="s0">sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied;</span>
<a name="l969"><span class="ln">969  </span></a><span class="s0">and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined.</span>
<a name="l970"><span class="ln">970  </span></a><span class="s0">She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant;</span>
<a name="l971"><span class="ln">971  </span></a><span class="s0">and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any</span>
<a name="l972"><span class="ln">972  </span></a><span class="s0">time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges.</span>
<a name="l973"><span class="ln">973  </span></a><span class="s0">But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her,</span>
<a name="l974"><span class="ln">974  </span></a><span class="s0">and was confirmed in all her kind designs.</span>
<a name="l975"><span class="ln">975  </span></a>
<a name="l976"><span class="ln">976  </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,</span>
<a name="l977"><span class="ln">977  </span></a><span class="s0">grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring</span>
<a name="l978"><span class="ln">978  </span></a><span class="s0">to be guided by any one she looked up to.  Her early attachment</span>
<a name="l979"><span class="ln">979  </span></a><span class="s0">to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company,</span>
<a name="l980"><span class="ln">980  </span></a><span class="s0">and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that</span>
<a name="l981"><span class="ln">981  </span></a><span class="s0">there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must</span>
<a name="l982"><span class="ln">982  </span></a><span class="s0">not be expected.  Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet</span>
<a name="l983"><span class="ln">983  </span></a><span class="s0">Smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the</span>
<a name="l984"><span class="ln">984  </span></a><span class="s0">something which her home required.  Such a friend as Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l985"><span class="ln">985  </span></a><span class="s0">was out of the question.  Two such could never be granted.</span>
<a name="l986"><span class="ln">986  </span></a><span class="s0">Two such she did not want.  It was quite a different sort of thing,</span>
<a name="l987"><span class="ln">987  </span></a><span class="s0">a sentiment distinct and independent.  Mrs. Weston was the object</span>
<a name="l988"><span class="ln">988  </span></a><span class="s0">of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.</span>
<a name="l989"><span class="ln">989  </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.</span>
<a name="l990"><span class="ln">990  </span></a><span class="s0">For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.</span>
<a name="l991"><span class="ln">991  </span></a>
<a name="l992"><span class="ln">992  </span></a><span class="s0">Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who</span>
<a name="l993"><span class="ln">993  </span></a><span class="s0">were the parents, but Harriet could not tell.  She was ready to tell</span>
<a name="l994"><span class="ln">994  </span></a><span class="s0">every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain.</span>
<a name="l995"><span class="ln">995  </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never</span>
<a name="l996"><span class="ln">996  </span></a><span class="s0">believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered</span>
<a name="l997"><span class="ln">997  </span></a><span class="s0">the truth.  Harriet had no penetration.  She had been satisfied</span>
<a name="l998"><span class="ln">998  </span></a><span class="s0">to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her;</span>
<a name="l999"><span class="ln">999  </span></a><span class="s0">and looked no farther.</span>
<a name="l1000"><span class="ln">1000 </span></a>
<a name="l1001"><span class="ln">1001 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the</span>
<a name="l1002"><span class="ln">1002 </span></a><span class="s0">school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and</span>
<a name="l1003"><span class="ln">1003 </span></a><span class="s0">but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm,</span>
<a name="l1004"><span class="ln">1004 </span></a><span class="s0">it must have been the whole.  But the Martins occupied her thoughts</span>
<a name="l1005"><span class="ln">1005 </span></a><span class="s0">a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,</span>
<a name="l1006"><span class="ln">1006 </span></a><span class="s0">and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe</span>
<a name="l1007"><span class="ln">1007 </span></a><span class="s0">the many comforts and wonders of the place.  Emma encouraged her</span>
<a name="l1008"><span class="ln">1008 </span></a><span class="s0">talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,</span>
<a name="l1009"><span class="ln">1009 </span></a><span class="s0">and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much</span>
<a name="l1010"><span class="ln">1010 </span></a><span class="s0">exultation of Mrs. Martin's having &quot;_two_ parlours, two very good parlours,</span>
<a name="l1011"><span class="ln">1011 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room;</span>
<a name="l1012"><span class="ln">1012 </span></a><span class="s0">and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years</span>
<a name="l1013"><span class="ln">1013 </span></a><span class="s0">with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys,</span>
<a name="l1014"><span class="ln">1014 </span></a><span class="s0">and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed;</span>
<a name="l1015"><span class="ln">1015 </span></a><span class="s0">and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it should be</span>
<a name="l1016"><span class="ln">1016 </span></a><span class="s0">called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house</span>
<a name="l1017"><span class="ln">1017 </span></a><span class="s0">in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink</span>
<a name="l1018"><span class="ln">1018 </span></a><span class="s0">tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1019"><span class="ln">1019 </span></a>
<a name="l1020"><span class="ln">1020 </span></a><span class="s0">For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause;</span>
<a name="l1021"><span class="ln">1021 </span></a><span class="s0">but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose.</span>
<a name="l1022"><span class="ln">1022 </span></a><span class="s0">She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter,</span>
<a name="l1023"><span class="ln">1023 </span></a><span class="s0">a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared</span>
<a name="l1024"><span class="ln">1024 </span></a><span class="s0">that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always</span>
<a name="l1025"><span class="ln">1025 </span></a><span class="s0">mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something</span>
<a name="l1026"><span class="ln">1026 </span></a><span class="s0">or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin,</span>
<a name="l1027"><span class="ln">1027 </span></a><span class="s0">no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little</span>
<a name="l1028"><span class="ln">1028 </span></a><span class="s0">friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she</span>
<a name="l1029"><span class="ln">1029 </span></a><span class="s0">were not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.</span>
<a name="l1030"><span class="ln">1030 </span></a>
<a name="l1031"><span class="ln">1031 </span></a><span class="s0">With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number</span>
<a name="l1032"><span class="ln">1032 </span></a><span class="s0">and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,</span>
<a name="l1033"><span class="ln">1033 </span></a><span class="s0">and there was evidently no dislike to it.  Harriet was very ready</span>
<a name="l1034"><span class="ln">1034 </span></a><span class="s0">to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry</span>
<a name="l1035"><span class="ln">1035 </span></a><span class="s0">evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured</span>
<a name="l1036"><span class="ln">1036 </span></a><span class="s0">and obliging.  He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring</span>
<a name="l1037"><span class="ln">1037 </span></a><span class="s0">her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them,</span>
<a name="l1038"><span class="ln">1038 </span></a><span class="s0">and in every thing else he was so very obliging.  He had his</span>
<a name="l1039"><span class="ln">1039 </span></a><span class="s0">shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.</span>
<a name="l1040"><span class="ln">1040 </span></a><span class="s0">She was very fond of singing.  He could sing a little himself.</span>
<a name="l1041"><span class="ln">1041 </span></a><span class="s0">She believed he was very clever, and understood every thing.</span>
<a name="l1042"><span class="ln">1042 </span></a><span class="s0">He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them,</span>
<a name="l1043"><span class="ln">1043 </span></a><span class="s0">he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country.</span>
<a name="l1044"><span class="ln">1044 </span></a><span class="s0">She believed every body spoke well of him.  His mother and sisters</span>
<a name="l1045"><span class="ln">1045 </span></a><span class="s0">were very fond of him.  Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there</span>
<a name="l1046"><span class="ln">1046 </span></a><span class="s0">was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body</span>
<a name="l1047"><span class="ln">1047 </span></a><span class="s0">to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married,</span>
<a name="l1048"><span class="ln">1048 </span></a><span class="s0">he would make a good husband.  Not that she _wanted_ him to marry.</span>
<a name="l1049"><span class="ln">1049 </span></a><span class="s0">She was in no hurry at all.</span>
<a name="l1050"><span class="ln">1050 </span></a>
<a name="l1051"><span class="ln">1051 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well done, Mrs. Martin!&quot; thought Emma.  &quot;You know what you are about.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1052"><span class="ln">1052 </span></a>
<a name="l1053"><span class="ln">1053 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send</span>
<a name="l1054"><span class="ln">1054 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had</span>
<a name="l1055"><span class="ln">1055 </span></a><span class="s0">ever seen.  Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all</span>
<a name="l1056"><span class="ln">1056 </span></a><span class="s0">the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson,</span>
<a name="l1057"><span class="ln">1057 </span></a><span class="s0">to sup with her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1058"><span class="ln">1058 </span></a>
<a name="l1059"><span class="ln">1059 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line</span>
<a name="l1060"><span class="ln">1060 </span></a><span class="s0">of his own business? He does not read?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1061"><span class="ln">1061 </span></a>
<a name="l1062"><span class="ln">1062 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has</span>
<a name="l1063"><span class="ln">1063 </span></a><span class="s0">read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of.</span>
<a name="l1064"><span class="ln">1064 </span></a><span class="s0">He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay</span>
<a name="l1065"><span class="ln">1065 </span></a><span class="s0">in one of the window seats--but he reads all _them_ to himself.</span>
<a name="l1066"><span class="ln">1066 </span></a><span class="s0">But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read</span>
<a name="l1067"><span class="ln">1067 </span></a><span class="s0">something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining.</span>
<a name="l1068"><span class="ln">1068 </span></a><span class="s0">And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield.  He never read the</span>
<a name="l1069"><span class="ln">1069 </span></a><span class="s0">Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey.  He had never</span>
<a name="l1070"><span class="ln">1070 </span></a><span class="s0">heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined</span>
<a name="l1071"><span class="ln">1071 </span></a><span class="s0">to get them now as soon as ever he can.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1072"><span class="ln">1072 </span></a>
<a name="l1073"><span class="ln">1073 </span></a><span class="s0">The next question was--</span>
<a name="l1074"><span class="ln">1074 </span></a>
<a name="l1075"><span class="ln">1075 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1076"><span class="ln">1076 </span></a>
<a name="l1077"><span class="ln">1077 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome.  I thought him very plain</span>
<a name="l1078"><span class="ln">1078 </span></a><span class="s0">at first, but I do not think him so plain now.  One does not, you know,</span>
<a name="l1079"><span class="ln">1079 </span></a><span class="s0">after a time.  But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every</span>
<a name="l1080"><span class="ln">1080 </span></a><span class="s0">now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way</span>
<a name="l1081"><span class="ln">1081 </span></a><span class="s0">to Kingston.  He has passed you very often.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1082"><span class="ln">1082 </span></a>
<a name="l1083"><span class="ln">1083 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without</span>
<a name="l1084"><span class="ln">1084 </span></a><span class="s0">having any idea of his name.  A young farmer, whether on horseback</span>
<a name="l1085"><span class="ln">1085 </span></a><span class="s0">or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity.</span>
<a name="l1086"><span class="ln">1086 </span></a><span class="s0">The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I</span>
<a name="l1087"><span class="ln">1087 </span></a><span class="s0">can have nothing to do.  A degree or two lower, and a creditable</span>
<a name="l1088"><span class="ln">1088 </span></a><span class="s0">appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their</span>
<a name="l1089"><span class="ln">1089 </span></a><span class="s0">families in some way or other.  But a farmer can need none of my help,</span>
<a name="l1090"><span class="ln">1090 </span></a><span class="s0">and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every</span>
<a name="l1091"><span class="ln">1091 </span></a><span class="s0">other he is below it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1092"><span class="ln">1092 </span></a>
<a name="l1093"><span class="ln">1093 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To be sure.  Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have</span>
<a name="l1094"><span class="ln">1094 </span></a><span class="s0">observed him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1095"><span class="ln">1095 </span></a>
<a name="l1096"><span class="ln">1096 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man.</span>
<a name="l1097"><span class="ln">1097 </span></a><span class="s0">I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well.</span>
<a name="l1098"><span class="ln">1098 </span></a><span class="s0">What do you imagine his age to be?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1099"><span class="ln">1099 </span></a>
<a name="l1100"><span class="ln">1100 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is</span>
<a name="l1101"><span class="ln">1101 </span></a><span class="s0">the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1102"><span class="ln">1102 </span></a>
<a name="l1103"><span class="ln">1103 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle.  His mother is</span>
<a name="l1104"><span class="ln">1104 </span></a><span class="s0">perfectly right not to be in a hurry.  They seem very comfortable</span>
<a name="l1105"><span class="ln">1105 </span></a><span class="s0">as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him,</span>
<a name="l1106"><span class="ln">1106 </span></a><span class="s0">she would probably repent it.  Six years hence, if he could meet</span>
<a name="l1107"><span class="ln">1107 </span></a><span class="s0">with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own,</span>
<a name="l1108"><span class="ln">1108 </span></a><span class="s0">with a little money, it might be very desirable.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1109"><span class="ln">1109 </span></a>
<a name="l1110"><span class="ln">1110 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!&quot;</span>
<a name="l1111"><span class="ln">1111 </span></a>
<a name="l1112"><span class="ln">1112 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry,</span>
<a name="l1113"><span class="ln">1113 </span></a><span class="s0">who are not born to an independence.  Mr. Martin, I imagine,</span>
<a name="l1114"><span class="ln">1114 </span></a><span class="s0">has his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with</span>
<a name="l1115"><span class="ln">1115 </span></a><span class="s0">the world.  Whatever money he might come into when his father died,</span>
<a name="l1116"><span class="ln">1116 </span></a><span class="s0">whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say,</span>
<a name="l1117"><span class="ln">1117 </span></a><span class="s0">all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though,</span>
<a name="l1118"><span class="ln">1118 </span></a><span class="s0">with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to</span>
<a name="l1119"><span class="ln">1119 </span></a><span class="s0">impossible that he should have realised any thing yet.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1120"><span class="ln">1120 </span></a>
<a name="l1121"><span class="ln">1121 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To be sure, so it is.  But they live very comfortably.</span>
<a name="l1122"><span class="ln">1122 </span></a><span class="s0">They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing;</span>
<a name="l1123"><span class="ln">1123 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1124"><span class="ln">1124 </span></a>
<a name="l1125"><span class="ln">1125 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does</span>
<a name="l1126"><span class="ln">1126 </span></a><span class="s0">marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though</span>
<a name="l1127"><span class="ln">1127 </span></a><span class="s0">his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether</span>
<a name="l1128"><span class="ln">1128 </span></a><span class="s0">objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit</span>
<a name="l1129"><span class="ln">1129 </span></a><span class="s0">for you to notice.  The misfortune of your birth ought to make you</span>
<a name="l1130"><span class="ln">1130 </span></a><span class="s0">particularly careful as to your associates.  There can be no doubt</span>
<a name="l1131"><span class="ln">1131 </span></a><span class="s0">of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support your</span>
<a name="l1132"><span class="ln">1132 </span></a><span class="s0">claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there</span>
<a name="l1133"><span class="ln">1133 </span></a><span class="s0">will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1134"><span class="ln">1134 </span></a>
<a name="l1135"><span class="ln">1135 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are.  But while I visit</span>
<a name="l1136"><span class="ln">1136 </span></a><span class="s0">at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l1137"><span class="ln">1137 </span></a><span class="s0">I am not afraid of what any body can do.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1138"><span class="ln">1138 </span></a>
<a name="l1139"><span class="ln">1139 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I</span>
<a name="l1140"><span class="ln">1140 </span></a><span class="s0">would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be</span>
<a name="l1141"><span class="ln">1141 </span></a><span class="s0">independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.  I want to see you</span>
<a name="l1142"><span class="ln">1142 </span></a><span class="s0">permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable</span>
<a name="l1143"><span class="ln">1143 </span></a><span class="s0">to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say</span>
<a name="l1144"><span class="ln">1144 </span></a><span class="s0">that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries,</span>
<a name="l1145"><span class="ln">1145 </span></a><span class="s0">I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters,</span>
<a name="l1146"><span class="ln">1146 </span></a><span class="s0">to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere</span>
<a name="l1147"><span class="ln">1147 </span></a><span class="s0">farmer's daughter, without education.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1148"><span class="ln">1148 </span></a>
<a name="l1149"><span class="ln">1149 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To be sure.  Yes.  Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body</span>
<a name="l1150"><span class="ln">1150 </span></a><span class="s0">but what had had some education--and been very well brought up.</span>
<a name="l1151"><span class="ln">1151 </span></a><span class="s0">However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's--and I</span>
<a name="l1152"><span class="ln">1152 </span></a><span class="s0">am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife.  I shall</span>
<a name="l1153"><span class="ln">1153 </span></a><span class="s0">always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth,</span>
<a name="l1154"><span class="ln">1154 </span></a><span class="s0">and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well</span>
<a name="l1155"><span class="ln">1155 </span></a><span class="s0">educated as me.  But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,</span>
<a name="l1156"><span class="ln">1156 </span></a><span class="s0">certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1157"><span class="ln">1157 </span></a>
<a name="l1158"><span class="ln">1158 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech,</span>
<a name="l1159"><span class="ln">1159 </span></a><span class="s0">and saw no alarming symptoms of love.  The young man had been</span>
<a name="l1160"><span class="ln">1160 </span></a><span class="s0">the first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold,</span>
<a name="l1161"><span class="ln">1161 </span></a><span class="s0">and that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side,</span>
<a name="l1162"><span class="ln">1162 </span></a><span class="s0">to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own.</span>
<a name="l1163"><span class="ln">1163 </span></a>
<a name="l1164"><span class="ln">1164 </span></a><span class="s0">They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the</span>
<a name="l1165"><span class="ln">1165 </span></a><span class="s0">Donwell road.  He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully</span>
<a name="l1166"><span class="ln">1166 </span></a><span class="s0">at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion.</span>
<a name="l1167"><span class="ln">1167 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey;</span>
<a name="l1168"><span class="ln">1168 </span></a><span class="s0">and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made</span>
<a name="l1169"><span class="ln">1169 </span></a><span class="s0">her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin.</span>
<a name="l1170"><span class="ln">1170 </span></a><span class="s0">His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man,</span>
<a name="l1171"><span class="ln">1171 </span></a><span class="s0">but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be</span>
<a name="l1172"><span class="ln">1172 </span></a><span class="s0">contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground</span>
<a name="l1173"><span class="ln">1173 </span></a><span class="s0">he had gained in Harriet's inclination.  Harriet was not insensible</span>
<a name="l1174"><span class="ln">1174 </span></a><span class="s0">of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness</span>
<a name="l1175"><span class="ln">1175 </span></a><span class="s0">with admiration as well as wonder.  Mr. Martin looked as if he</span>
<a name="l1176"><span class="ln">1176 </span></a><span class="s0">did not know what manner was.</span>
<a name="l1177"><span class="ln">1177 </span></a>
<a name="l1178"><span class="ln">1178 </span></a><span class="s0">They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must</span>
<a name="l1179"><span class="ln">1179 </span></a><span class="s0">not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a</span>
<a name="l1180"><span class="ln">1180 </span></a><span class="s0">smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l1181"><span class="ln">1181 </span></a><span class="s0">hoped very soon to compose.</span>
<a name="l1182"><span class="ln">1182 </span></a>
<a name="l1183"><span class="ln">1183 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was</span>
<a name="l1184"><span class="ln">1184 </span></a><span class="s0">quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls.</span>
<a name="l1185"><span class="ln">1185 </span></a><span class="s0">He did not think we ever walked this road.  He thought we walked</span>
<a name="l1186"><span class="ln">1186 </span></a><span class="s0">towards Randalls most days.  He has not been able to get the</span>
<a name="l1187"><span class="ln">1187 </span></a><span class="s0">Romance of the Forest yet.  He was so busy the last time he was</span>
<a name="l1188"><span class="ln">1188 </span></a><span class="s0">at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow.</span>
<a name="l1189"><span class="ln">1189 </span></a><span class="s0">So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he</span>
<a name="l1190"><span class="ln">1190 </span></a><span class="s0">like what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him</span>
<a name="l1191"><span class="ln">1191 </span></a><span class="s0">so very plain?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1192"><span class="ln">1192 </span></a>
<a name="l1193"><span class="ln">1193 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is</span>
<a name="l1194"><span class="ln">1194 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing compared with his entire want of gentility.  I had no</span>
<a name="l1195"><span class="ln">1195 </span></a><span class="s0">right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no</span>
<a name="l1196"><span class="ln">1196 </span></a><span class="s0">idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air.</span>
<a name="l1197"><span class="ln">1197 </span></a><span class="s0">I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1198"><span class="ln">1198 </span></a>
<a name="l1199"><span class="ln">1199 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To be sure,&quot; said Harriet, in a mortified voice, &quot;he is not</span>
<a name="l1200"><span class="ln">1200 </span></a><span class="s0">so genteel as real gentlemen.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1201"><span class="ln">1201 </span></a>
<a name="l1202"><span class="ln">1202 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been</span>
<a name="l1203"><span class="ln">1203 </span></a><span class="s0">repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen,</span>
<a name="l1204"><span class="ln">1204 </span></a><span class="s0">that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.</span>
<a name="l1205"><span class="ln">1205 </span></a><span class="s0">At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,</span>
<a name="l1206"><span class="ln">1206 </span></a><span class="s0">well bred men.  I should be surprized if, after seeing them,</span>
<a name="l1207"><span class="ln">1207 </span></a><span class="s0">you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving</span>
<a name="l1208"><span class="ln">1208 </span></a><span class="s0">him to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at</span>
<a name="l1209"><span class="ln">1209 </span></a><span class="s0">yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before.</span>
<a name="l1210"><span class="ln">1210 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure</span>
<a name="l1211"><span class="ln">1211 </span></a><span class="s0">you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner,</span>
<a name="l1212"><span class="ln">1212 </span></a><span class="s0">and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated</span>
<a name="l1213"><span class="ln">1213 </span></a><span class="s0">as I stood here.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1214"><span class="ln">1214 </span></a>
<a name="l1215"><span class="ln">1215 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley.  He has not such a fine</span>
<a name="l1216"><span class="ln">1216 </span></a><span class="s0">air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley.  I see the difference</span>
<a name="l1217"><span class="ln">1217 </span></a><span class="s0">plain enough.  But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!&quot;</span>
<a name="l1218"><span class="ln">1218 </span></a>
<a name="l1219"><span class="ln">1219 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair</span>
<a name="l1220"><span class="ln">1220 </span></a><span class="s0">to compare Mr. Martin with _him_.  You might not see one in a hundred</span>
<a name="l1221"><span class="ln">1221 </span></a><span class="s0">with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley.  But he is</span>
<a name="l1222"><span class="ln">1222 </span></a><span class="s0">not the only gentleman you have been lately used to.  What say you</span>
<a name="l1223"><span class="ln">1223 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_.</span>
<a name="l1224"><span class="ln">1224 </span></a><span class="s0">Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking;</span>
<a name="l1225"><span class="ln">1225 </span></a><span class="s0">of being silent.  You must see the difference.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1226"><span class="ln">1226 </span></a>
<a name="l1227"><span class="ln">1227 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes!--there is a great difference.  But Mr. Weston is almost</span>
<a name="l1228"><span class="ln">1228 </span></a><span class="s0">an old man.  Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1229"><span class="ln">1229 </span></a>
<a name="l1230"><span class="ln">1230 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Which makes his good manners the more valuable.  The older a</span>
<a name="l1231"><span class="ln">1231 </span></a><span class="s0">person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners</span>
<a name="l1232"><span class="ln">1232 </span></a><span class="s0">should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness,</span>
<a name="l1233"><span class="ln">1233 </span></a><span class="s0">or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes.  What is passable in youth</span>
<a name="l1234"><span class="ln">1234 </span></a><span class="s0">is detestable in later age.  Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt;</span>
<a name="l1235"><span class="ln">1235 </span></a><span class="s0">what will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1236"><span class="ln">1236 </span></a>
<a name="l1237"><span class="ln">1237 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There is no saying, indeed,&quot; replied Harriet rather solemnly.</span>
<a name="l1238"><span class="ln">1238 </span></a>
<a name="l1239"><span class="ln">1239 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But there may be pretty good guessing.  He will be a completely gross,</span>
<a name="l1240"><span class="ln">1240 </span></a><span class="s0">vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking</span>
<a name="l1241"><span class="ln">1241 </span></a><span class="s0">of nothing but profit and loss.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1242"><span class="ln">1242 </span></a>
<a name="l1243"><span class="ln">1243 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1244"><span class="ln">1244 </span></a>
<a name="l1245"><span class="ln">1245 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the</span>
<a name="l1246"><span class="ln">1246 </span></a><span class="s0">circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.</span>
<a name="l1247"><span class="ln">1247 </span></a><span class="s0">He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing</span>
<a name="l1248"><span class="ln">1248 </span></a><span class="s0">else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man.  What has</span>
<a name="l1249"><span class="ln">1249 </span></a><span class="s0">he to do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive,</span>
<a name="l1250"><span class="ln">1250 </span></a><span class="s0">and be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse</span>
<a name="l1251"><span class="ln">1251 </span></a><span class="s0">need not disturb _us_.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1252"><span class="ln">1252 </span></a>
<a name="l1253"><span class="ln">1253 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I wonder he did not remember the book&quot;--was all Harriet's answer,</span>
<a name="l1254"><span class="ln">1254 </span></a><span class="s0">and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might</span>
<a name="l1255"><span class="ln">1255 </span></a><span class="s0">be safely left to itself.  She, therefore, said no more for some time.</span>
<a name="l1256"><span class="ln">1256 </span></a><span class="s0">Her next beginning was,</span>
<a name="l1257"><span class="ln">1257 </span></a>
<a name="l1258"><span class="ln">1258 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior</span>
<a name="l1259"><span class="ln">1259 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness.</span>
<a name="l1260"><span class="ln">1260 </span></a><span class="s0">They might be more safely held up as a pattern.  There is an openness,</span>
<a name="l1261"><span class="ln">1261 </span></a><span class="s0">a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body</span>
<a name="l1262"><span class="ln">1262 </span></a><span class="s0">likes in _him_, because there is so much good-humour with it--but</span>
<a name="l1263"><span class="ln">1263 </span></a><span class="s0">that would not do to be copied.  Neither would Mr. Knightley's</span>
<a name="l1264"><span class="ln">1264 </span></a><span class="s0">downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits</span>
<a name="l1265"><span class="ln">1265 </span></a><span class="s0">_him_ very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem</span>
<a name="l1266"><span class="ln">1266 </span></a><span class="s0">to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him,</span>
<a name="l1267"><span class="ln">1267 </span></a><span class="s0">he would not be sufferable.  On the contrary, I think a young man</span>
<a name="l1268"><span class="ln">1268 </span></a><span class="s0">might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model.</span>
<a name="l1269"><span class="ln">1269 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.</span>
<a name="l1270"><span class="ln">1270 </span></a><span class="s0">He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late.  I do not</span>
<a name="l1271"><span class="ln">1271 </span></a><span class="s0">know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either</span>
<a name="l1272"><span class="ln">1272 </span></a><span class="s0">of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his</span>
<a name="l1273"><span class="ln">1273 </span></a><span class="s0">manners are softer than they used to be.  If he means any thing,</span>
<a name="l1274"><span class="ln">1274 </span></a><span class="s0">it must be to please you.  Did not I tell you what he said of you</span>
<a name="l1275"><span class="ln">1275 </span></a><span class="s0">the other day?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1276"><span class="ln">1276 </span></a>
<a name="l1277"><span class="ln">1277 </span></a><span class="s0">She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn</span>
<a name="l1278"><span class="ln">1278 </span></a><span class="s0">from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed</span>
<a name="l1279"><span class="ln">1279 </span></a><span class="s0">and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.</span>
<a name="l1280"><span class="ln">1280 </span></a>
<a name="l1281"><span class="ln">1281 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving</span>
<a name="l1282"><span class="ln">1282 </span></a><span class="s0">the young farmer out of Harriet's head.  She thought it would</span>
<a name="l1283"><span class="ln">1283 </span></a><span class="s0">be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural,</span>
<a name="l1284"><span class="ln">1284 </span></a><span class="s0">and probable, for her to have much merit in planning it.</span>
<a name="l1285"><span class="ln">1285 </span></a><span class="s0">She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict.</span>
<a name="l1286"><span class="ln">1286 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled</span>
<a name="l1287"><span class="ln">1287 </span></a><span class="s0">her in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during</span>
<a name="l1288"><span class="ln">1288 </span></a><span class="s0">the very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield.  The longer</span>
<a name="l1289"><span class="ln">1289 </span></a><span class="s0">she considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency.</span>
<a name="l1290"><span class="ln">1290 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself,</span>
<a name="l1291"><span class="ln">1291 </span></a><span class="s0">and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family</span>
<a name="l1292"><span class="ln">1292 </span></a><span class="s0">that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.  He had a</span>
<a name="l1293"><span class="ln">1293 </span></a><span class="s0">comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income;</span>
<a name="l1294"><span class="ln">1294 </span></a><span class="s0">for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known</span>
<a name="l1295"><span class="ln">1295 </span></a><span class="s0">to have some independent property; and she thought very highly</span>
<a name="l1296"><span class="ln">1296 </span></a><span class="s0">of him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man,</span>
<a name="l1297"><span class="ln">1297 </span></a><span class="s0">without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.</span>
<a name="l1298"><span class="ln">1298 </span></a>
<a name="l1299"><span class="ln">1299 </span></a><span class="s0">She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful</span>
<a name="l1300"><span class="ln">1300 </span></a><span class="s0">girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l1301"><span class="ln">1301 </span></a><span class="s0">was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be</span>
<a name="l1302"><span class="ln">1302 </span></a><span class="s0">little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all</span>
<a name="l1303"><span class="ln">1303 </span></a><span class="s0">the usual weight and efficacy.  And he was really a very pleasing</span>
<a name="l1304"><span class="ln">1304 </span></a><span class="s0">young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like.</span>
<a name="l1305"><span class="ln">1305 </span></a><span class="s0">He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general,</span>
<a name="l1306"><span class="ln">1306 </span></a><span class="s0">though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which</span>
<a name="l1307"><span class="ln">1307 </span></a><span class="s0">she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified</span>
<a name="l1308"><span class="ln">1308 </span></a><span class="s0">by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts</span>
<a name="l1309"><span class="ln">1309 </span></a><span class="s0">for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.</span>
<a name="l1310"><span class="ln">1310 </span></a>

<a name="l1315"><span class="ln">1315 </span></a>
<a name="l1316"><span class="ln">1316 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,&quot; said Mr. Knightley, &quot;of</span>
<a name="l1317"><span class="ln">1317 </span></a><span class="s0">this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1318"><span class="ln">1318 </span></a>
<a name="l1319"><span class="ln">1319 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1320"><span class="ln">1320 </span></a>
<a name="l1321"><span class="ln">1321 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I think they will neither of them do the other any good.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1322"><span class="ln">1322 </span></a>
<a name="l1323"><span class="ln">1323 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her</span>
<a name="l1324"><span class="ln">1324 </span></a><span class="s0">with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good.</span>
<a name="l1325"><span class="ln">1325 </span></a><span class="s0">I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.</span>
<a name="l1326"><span class="ln">1326 </span></a><span class="s0">How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any</span>
<a name="l1327"><span class="ln">1327 </span></a><span class="s0">good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels</span>
<a name="l1328"><span class="ln">1328 </span></a><span class="s0">about Emma, Mr. Knightley.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1329"><span class="ln">1329 </span></a>
<a name="l1330"><span class="ln">1330 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you,</span>
<a name="l1331"><span class="ln">1331 </span></a><span class="s0">knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1332"><span class="ln">1332 </span></a>
<a name="l1333"><span class="ln">1333 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here,</span>
<a name="l1334"><span class="ln">1334 </span></a><span class="s0">for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject.  We were speaking</span>
<a name="l1335"><span class="ln">1335 </span></a><span class="s0">of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma,</span>
<a name="l1336"><span class="ln">1336 </span></a><span class="s0">that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with.</span>
<a name="l1337"><span class="ln">1337 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.</span>
<a name="l1338"><span class="ln">1338 </span></a><span class="s0">You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value</span>
<a name="l1339"><span class="ln">1339 </span></a><span class="s0">of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort</span>
<a name="l1340"><span class="ln">1340 </span></a><span class="s0">a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used</span>
<a name="l1341"><span class="ln">1341 </span></a><span class="s0">to it all her life.  I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith.</span>
<a name="l1342"><span class="ln">1342 </span></a><span class="s0">She is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be.</span>
<a name="l1343"><span class="ln">1343 </span></a><span class="s0">But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed,</span>
<a name="l1344"><span class="ln">1344 </span></a><span class="s0">it will be an inducement to her to read more herself.  They will</span>
<a name="l1345"><span class="ln">1345 </span></a><span class="s0">read together.  She means it, I know.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1346"><span class="ln">1346 </span></a>
<a name="l1347"><span class="ln">1347 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve</span>
<a name="l1348"><span class="ln">1348 </span></a><span class="s0">years old.  I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at</span>
<a name="l1349"><span class="ln">1349 </span></a><span class="s0">various times of books that she meant to read regularly through--and</span>
<a name="l1350"><span class="ln">1350 </span></a><span class="s0">very good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly</span>
<a name="l1351"><span class="ln">1351 </span></a><span class="s0">arranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule.</span>
<a name="l1352"><span class="ln">1352 </span></a><span class="s0">The list she drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it</span>
<a name="l1353"><span class="ln">1353 </span></a><span class="s0">did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;</span>
<a name="l1354"><span class="ln">1354 </span></a><span class="s0">and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now.  But I</span>
<a name="l1355"><span class="ln">1355 </span></a><span class="s0">have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.</span>
<a name="l1356"><span class="ln">1356 </span></a><span class="s0">She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,</span>
<a name="l1357"><span class="ln">1357 </span></a><span class="s0">and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.  Where Miss Taylor</span>
<a name="l1358"><span class="ln">1358 </span></a><span class="s0">failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do</span>
<a name="l1359"><span class="ln">1359 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you</span>
<a name="l1360"><span class="ln">1360 </span></a><span class="s0">wished.--You know you could not.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1361"><span class="ln">1361 </span></a>
<a name="l1362"><span class="ln">1362 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I dare say,&quot; replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, &quot;that I thought</span>
<a name="l1363"><span class="ln">1363 </span></a><span class="s0">so _then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's</span>
<a name="l1364"><span class="ln">1364 </span></a><span class="s0">omitting to do any thing I wished.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1365"><span class="ln">1365 </span></a>
<a name="l1366"><span class="ln">1366 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,&quot;--said</span>
<a name="l1367"><span class="ln">1367 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done.  &quot;But I,&quot;</span>
<a name="l1368"><span class="ln">1368 </span></a><span class="s0">he soon added, &quot;who have had no such charm thrown over my senses,</span>
<a name="l1369"><span class="ln">1369 </span></a><span class="s0">must still see, hear, and remember.  Emma is spoiled by being the</span>
<a name="l1370"><span class="ln">1370 </span></a><span class="s0">cleverest of her family.  At ten years old, she had the misfortune of</span>
<a name="l1371"><span class="ln">1371 </span></a><span class="s0">being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen.</span>
<a name="l1372"><span class="ln">1372 </span></a><span class="s0">She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident.</span>
<a name="l1373"><span class="ln">1373 </span></a><span class="s0">And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house</span>
<a name="l1374"><span class="ln">1374 </span></a><span class="s0">and of you all.  In her mother she lost the only person able to cope</span>
<a name="l1375"><span class="ln">1375 </span></a><span class="s0">with her.  She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been</span>
<a name="l1376"><span class="ln">1376 </span></a><span class="s0">under subjection to her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1377"><span class="ln">1377 </span></a>
<a name="l1378"><span class="ln">1378 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on</span>
<a name="l1379"><span class="ln">1379 </span></a><span class="s0">_your_ recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted</span>
<a name="l1380"><span class="ln">1380 </span></a><span class="s0">another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for</span>
<a name="l1381"><span class="ln">1381 </span></a><span class="s0">me to any body.  I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1382"><span class="ln">1382 </span></a>
<a name="l1383"><span class="ln">1383 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, smiling.  &quot;You are better placed _here_; very fit</span>
<a name="l1384"><span class="ln">1384 </span></a><span class="s0">for a wife, but not at all for a governess.  But you were preparing</span>
<a name="l1385"><span class="ln">1385 </span></a><span class="s0">yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l1386"><span class="ln">1386 </span></a><span class="s0">You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would</span>
<a name="l1387"><span class="ln">1387 </span></a><span class="s0">seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_,</span>
<a name="l1388"><span class="ln">1388 </span></a><span class="s0">on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will,</span>
<a name="l1389"><span class="ln">1389 </span></a><span class="s0">and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend</span>
<a name="l1390"><span class="ln">1390 </span></a><span class="s0">him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1391"><span class="ln">1391 </span></a>
<a name="l1392"><span class="ln">1392 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you.  There will be very little merit in making a good wife</span>
<a name="l1393"><span class="ln">1393 </span></a><span class="s0">to such a man as Mr. Weston.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1394"><span class="ln">1394 </span></a>
<a name="l1395"><span class="ln">1395 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,</span>
<a name="l1396"><span class="ln">1396 </span></a><span class="s0">and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing</span>
<a name="l1397"><span class="ln">1397 </span></a><span class="s0">to be borne.  We will not despair, however.  Weston may grow cross</span>
<a name="l1398"><span class="ln">1398 </span></a><span class="s0">from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1399"><span class="ln">1399 </span></a>
<a name="l1400"><span class="ln">1400 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope not _that_.--It is not likely.  No, Mr. Knightley, do not</span>
<a name="l1401"><span class="ln">1401 </span></a><span class="s0">foretell vexation from that quarter.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1402"><span class="ln">1402 </span></a>
<a name="l1403"><span class="ln">1403 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not I, indeed.  I only name possibilities.  I do not pretend to Emma's</span>
<a name="l1404"><span class="ln">1404 </span></a><span class="s0">genius for foretelling and guessing.  I hope, with all my heart,</span>
<a name="l1405"><span class="ln">1405 </span></a><span class="s0">the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But</span>
<a name="l1406"><span class="ln">1406 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.  I think</span>
<a name="l1407"><span class="ln">1407 </span></a><span class="s0">her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have.</span>
<a name="l1408"><span class="ln">1408 </span></a><span class="s0">She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing.</span>
<a name="l1409"><span class="ln">1409 </span></a><span class="s0">She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,</span>
<a name="l1410"><span class="ln">1410 </span></a><span class="s0">because undesigned.  Her ignorance is hourly flattery.  How can</span>
<a name="l1411"><span class="ln">1411 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet</span>
<a name="l1412"><span class="ln">1412 </span></a><span class="s0">is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet,</span>
<a name="l1413"><span class="ln">1413 </span></a><span class="s0">I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance.</span>
<a name="l1414"><span class="ln">1414 </span></a><span class="s0">Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places</span>
<a name="l1415"><span class="ln">1415 </span></a><span class="s0">she belongs to.  She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable</span>
<a name="l1416"><span class="ln">1416 </span></a><span class="s0">with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home.</span>
<a name="l1417"><span class="ln">1417 </span></a><span class="s0">I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind,</span>
<a name="l1418"><span class="ln">1418 </span></a><span class="s0">or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties</span>
<a name="l1419"><span class="ln">1419 </span></a><span class="s0">of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1420"><span class="ln">1420 </span></a>
<a name="l1421"><span class="ln">1421 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more</span>
<a name="l1422"><span class="ln">1422 </span></a><span class="s0">anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.</span>
<a name="l1423"><span class="ln">1423 </span></a><span class="s0">How well she looked last night!&quot;</span>
<a name="l1424"><span class="ln">1424 </span></a>
<a name="l1425"><span class="ln">1425 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you?</span>
<a name="l1426"><span class="ln">1426 </span></a><span class="s0">Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1427"><span class="ln">1427 </span></a>
<a name="l1428"><span class="ln">1428 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Pretty! say beautiful rather.  Can you imagine any thing nearer</span>
<a name="l1429"><span class="ln">1429 </span></a><span class="s0">perfect beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1430"><span class="ln">1430 </span></a>
<a name="l1431"><span class="ln">1431 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have</span>
<a name="l1432"><span class="ln">1432 </span></a><span class="s0">seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers.</span>
<a name="l1433"><span class="ln">1433 </span></a><span class="s0">But I am a partial old friend.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1434"><span class="ln">1434 </span></a>
<a name="l1435"><span class="ln">1435 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,</span>
<a name="l1436"><span class="ln">1436 </span></a><span class="s0">open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,</span>
<a name="l1437"><span class="ln">1437 </span></a><span class="s0">and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!</span>
<a name="l1438"><span class="ln">1438 </span></a><span class="s0">There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head,</span>
<a name="l1439"><span class="ln">1439 </span></a><span class="s0">her glance.  One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture</span>
<a name="l1440"><span class="ln">1440 </span></a><span class="s0">of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete</span>

<a name="l1442"><span class="ln">1442 </span></a><span class="s0">is not she?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1443"><span class="ln">1443 </span></a>
<a name="l1444"><span class="ln">1444 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have not a fault to find with her person,&quot; he replied.</span>
<a name="l1445"><span class="ln">1445 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I think her all you describe.  I love to look at her; and I</span>
<a name="l1446"><span class="ln">1446 </span></a><span class="s0">will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain.</span>
<a name="l1447"><span class="ln">1447 </span></a><span class="s0">Considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little</span>
<a name="l1448"><span class="ln">1448 </span></a><span class="s0">occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.  Mrs. Weston, I am</span>
<a name="l1449"><span class="ln">1449 </span></a><span class="s0">not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread</span>
<a name="l1450"><span class="ln">1450 </span></a><span class="s0">of its doing them both harm.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1451"><span class="ln">1451 </span></a>
<a name="l1452"><span class="ln">1452 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its</span>
<a name="l1453"><span class="ln">1453 </span></a><span class="s0">not doing them any harm.  With all dear Emma's little faults,</span>
<a name="l1454"><span class="ln">1454 </span></a><span class="s0">she is an excellent creature.  Where shall we see a better daughter,</span>
<a name="l1455"><span class="ln">1455 </span></a><span class="s0">or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities</span>
<a name="l1456"><span class="ln">1456 </span></a><span class="s0">which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong;</span>
<a name="l1457"><span class="ln">1457 </span></a><span class="s0">she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the</span>
<a name="l1458"><span class="ln">1458 </span></a><span class="s0">right a hundred times.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1459"><span class="ln">1459 </span></a>
<a name="l1460"><span class="ln">1460 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very well; I will not plague you any more.  Emma shall be an angel,</span>
<a name="l1461"><span class="ln">1461 </span></a><span class="s0">and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John</span>
<a name="l1462"><span class="ln">1462 </span></a><span class="s0">and Isabella.  John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore</span>
<a name="l1463"><span class="ln">1463 </span></a><span class="s0">not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does;</span>
<a name="l1464"><span class="ln">1464 </span></a><span class="s0">except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children.</span>
<a name="l1465"><span class="ln">1465 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure of having their opinions with me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1466"><span class="ln">1466 </span></a>
<a name="l1467"><span class="ln">1467 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;</span>
<a name="l1468"><span class="ln">1468 </span></a><span class="s0">but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,</span>
<a name="l1469"><span class="ln">1469 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's</span>
<a name="l1470"><span class="ln">1470 </span></a><span class="s0">mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think</span>
<a name="l1471"><span class="ln">1471 </span></a><span class="s0">any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made</span>
<a name="l1472"><span class="ln">1472 </span></a><span class="s0">a matter of much discussion among you.  Pray excuse me; but supposing</span>
<a name="l1473"><span class="ln">1473 </span></a><span class="s0">any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy,</span>
<a name="l1474"><span class="ln">1474 </span></a><span class="s0">it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father,</span>
<a name="l1475"><span class="ln">1475 </span></a><span class="s0">who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it,</span>
<a name="l1476"><span class="ln">1476 </span></a><span class="s0">so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.  It has been so</span>
<a name="l1477"><span class="ln">1477 </span></a><span class="s0">many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,</span>
<a name="l1478"><span class="ln">1478 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1479"><span class="ln">1479 </span></a>
<a name="l1480"><span class="ln">1480 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not at all,&quot; cried he; &quot;I am much obliged to you for it.</span>
<a name="l1481"><span class="ln">1481 </span></a><span class="s0">It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your</span>
<a name="l1482"><span class="ln">1482 </span></a><span class="s0">advice has often found; for it shall be attended to.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1483"><span class="ln">1483 </span></a>
<a name="l1484"><span class="ln">1484 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy</span>
<a name="l1485"><span class="ln">1485 </span></a><span class="s0">about her sister.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1486"><span class="ln">1486 </span></a>
<a name="l1487"><span class="ln">1487 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Be satisfied,&quot; said he, &quot;I will not raise any outcry.  I will keep</span>
<a name="l1488"><span class="ln">1488 </span></a><span class="s0">my ill-humour to myself.  I have a very sincere interest in Emma.</span>
<a name="l1489"><span class="ln">1489 </span></a><span class="s0">Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a</span>
<a name="l1490"><span class="ln">1490 </span></a><span class="s0">greater interest; perhaps hardly so great.  There is an anxiety,</span>
<a name="l1491"><span class="ln">1491 </span></a><span class="s0">a curiosity in what one feels for Emma.  I wonder what will become</span>
<a name="l1492"><span class="ln">1492 </span></a><span class="s0">of her!&quot;</span>
<a name="l1493"><span class="ln">1493 </span></a>
<a name="l1494"><span class="ln">1494 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So do I,&quot; said Mrs. Weston gently, &quot;very much.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1495"><span class="ln">1495 </span></a>
<a name="l1496"><span class="ln">1496 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She always declares she will never marry, which, of course,</span>
<a name="l1497"><span class="ln">1497 </span></a><span class="s0">means just nothing at all.  But I have no idea that she has yet</span>
<a name="l1498"><span class="ln">1498 </span></a><span class="s0">ever seen a man she cared for.  It would not be a bad thing for her</span>
<a name="l1499"><span class="ln">1499 </span></a><span class="s0">to be very much in love with a proper object.  I should like to see</span>
<a name="l1500"><span class="ln">1500 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.</span>
<a name="l1501"><span class="ln">1501 </span></a><span class="s0">But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom</span>
<a name="l1502"><span class="ln">1502 </span></a><span class="s0">from home.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1503"><span class="ln">1503 </span></a>
<a name="l1504"><span class="ln">1504 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break</span>
<a name="l1505"><span class="ln">1505 </span></a><span class="s0">her resolution at present,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, &quot;as can well be;</span>
<a name="l1506"><span class="ln">1506 </span></a><span class="s0">and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be</span>
<a name="l1507"><span class="ln">1507 </span></a><span class="s0">forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties</span>
<a name="l1508"><span class="ln">1508 </span></a><span class="s0">on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account.  I do not recommend matrimony</span>
<a name="l1509"><span class="ln">1509 </span></a><span class="s0">at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1510"><span class="ln">1510 </span></a>
<a name="l1511"><span class="ln">1511 </span></a><span class="s0">Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of</span>
<a name="l1512"><span class="ln">1512 </span></a><span class="s0">her own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible.</span>
<a name="l1513"><span class="ln">1513 </span></a><span class="s0">There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it</span>
<a name="l1514"><span class="ln">1514 </span></a><span class="s0">was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition</span>
<a name="l1515"><span class="ln">1515 </span></a><span class="s0">which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to &quot;What does Weston</span>
<a name="l1516"><span class="ln">1516 </span></a><span class="s0">think of the weather; shall we have rain?&quot; convinced her that he</span>
<a name="l1517"><span class="ln">1517 </span></a><span class="s0">had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l1518"><span class="ln">1518 </span></a>

<a name="l1522"><span class="ln">1522 </span></a>
<a name="l1523"><span class="ln">1523 </span></a>
<a name="l1524"><span class="ln">1524 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy</span>
<a name="l1525"><span class="ln">1525 </span></a><span class="s0">a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity</span>
<a name="l1526"><span class="ln">1526 </span></a><span class="s0">to a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible</span>
<a name="l1527"><span class="ln">1527 </span></a><span class="s0">than before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most</span>
<a name="l1528"><span class="ln">1528 </span></a><span class="s0">agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up</span>
<a name="l1529"><span class="ln">1529 </span></a><span class="s0">the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon</span>
<a name="l1530"><span class="ln">1530 </span></a><span class="s0">pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet's side,</span>
<a name="l1531"><span class="ln">1531 </span></a><span class="s0">as there could be any occasion for.  She was quite convinced</span>
<a name="l1532"><span class="ln">1532 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love,</span>
<a name="l1533"><span class="ln">1533 </span></a><span class="s0">if not in love already.  She had no scruple with regard to him.</span>
<a name="l1534"><span class="ln">1534 </span></a><span class="s0">He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could</span>
<a name="l1535"><span class="ln">1535 </span></a><span class="s0">not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add.</span>
<a name="l1536"><span class="ln">1536 </span></a><span class="s0">His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner,</span>
<a name="l1537"><span class="ln">1537 </span></a><span class="s0">since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least</span>
<a name="l1538"><span class="ln">1538 </span></a><span class="s0">agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.</span>
<a name="l1539"><span class="ln">1539 </span></a>
<a name="l1540"><span class="ln">1540 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You have given Miss Smith all that she required,&quot; said he;</span>
<a name="l1541"><span class="ln">1541 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;you have made her graceful and easy.  She was a beautiful creature</span>
<a name="l1542"><span class="ln">1542 </span></a><span class="s0">when she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have</span>
<a name="l1543"><span class="ln">1543 </span></a><span class="s0">added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1544"><span class="ln">1544 </span></a>
<a name="l1545"><span class="ln">1545 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet</span>
<a name="l1546"><span class="ln">1546 </span></a><span class="s0">only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints.</span>
<a name="l1547"><span class="ln">1547 </span></a><span class="s0">She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness</span>
<a name="l1548"><span class="ln">1548 </span></a><span class="s0">in herself.  I have done very little.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1549"><span class="ln">1549 </span></a>
<a name="l1550"><span class="ln">1550 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If it were admissible to contradict a lady,&quot; said the gallant</span>
<a name="l1551"><span class="ln">1551 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton--</span>
<a name="l1552"><span class="ln">1552 </span></a>
<a name="l1553"><span class="ln">1553 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character,</span>
<a name="l1554"><span class="ln">1554 </span></a><span class="s0">have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her</span>
<a name="l1555"><span class="ln">1555 </span></a><span class="s0">way before.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1556"><span class="ln">1556 </span></a>
<a name="l1557"><span class="ln">1557 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me.  So much superadded</span>
<a name="l1558"><span class="ln">1558 </span></a><span class="s0">decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!&quot;</span>
<a name="l1559"><span class="ln">1559 </span></a>
<a name="l1560"><span class="ln">1560 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Great has been the pleasure, I am sure.  I never met with</span>
<a name="l1561"><span class="ln">1561 </span></a><span class="s0">a disposition more truly amiable.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1562"><span class="ln">1562 </span></a>
<a name="l1563"><span class="ln">1563 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have no doubt of it.&quot; And it was spoken with a sort</span>
<a name="l1564"><span class="ln">1564 </span></a><span class="s0">of sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover.</span>
<a name="l1565"><span class="ln">1565 </span></a><span class="s0">She was not less pleased another day with the manner</span>
<a name="l1566"><span class="ln">1566 </span></a><span class="s0">in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture.</span>
<a name="l1567"><span class="ln">1567 </span></a>
<a name="l1568"><span class="ln">1568 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?&quot; said she: &quot;did</span>
<a name="l1569"><span class="ln">1569 </span></a><span class="s0">you ever sit for your picture?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1570"><span class="ln">1570 </span></a>
<a name="l1571"><span class="ln">1571 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,</span>
<a name="l1572"><span class="ln">1572 </span></a><span class="s0">with a very interesting naivete,</span>
<a name="l1573"><span class="ln">1573 </span></a>
<a name="l1574"><span class="ln">1574 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! dear, no, never.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1575"><span class="ln">1575 </span></a>
<a name="l1576"><span class="ln">1576 </span></a><span class="s0">No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,</span>
<a name="l1577"><span class="ln">1577 </span></a>
<a name="l1578"><span class="ln">1578 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would</span>
<a name="l1579"><span class="ln">1579 </span></a><span class="s0">give any money for it.  I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.</span>
<a name="l1580"><span class="ln">1580 </span></a><span class="s0">You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had</span>
<a name="l1581"><span class="ln">1581 </span></a><span class="s0">a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of</span>
<a name="l1582"><span class="ln">1582 </span></a><span class="s0">my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general.</span>
<a name="l1583"><span class="ln">1583 </span></a><span class="s0">But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust.</span>
<a name="l1584"><span class="ln">1584 </span></a><span class="s0">But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me.</span>
<a name="l1585"><span class="ln">1585 </span></a><span class="s0">It would be such a delight to have her picture!&quot;</span>
<a name="l1586"><span class="ln">1586 </span></a>
<a name="l1587"><span class="ln">1587 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Let me entreat you,&quot; cried Mr. Elton; &quot;it would indeed be a delight!</span>
<a name="l1588"><span class="ln">1588 </span></a><span class="s0">Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a</span>
<a name="l1589"><span class="ln">1589 </span></a><span class="s0">talent in favour of your friend.  I know what your drawings are.</span>
<a name="l1590"><span class="ln">1590 </span></a><span class="s0">How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in</span>
<a name="l1591"><span class="ln">1591 </span></a><span class="s0">specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l1592"><span class="ln">1592 </span></a><span class="s0">some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1593"><span class="ln">1593 </span></a>
<a name="l1594"><span class="ln">1594 </span></a><span class="s0">Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking</span>
<a name="l1595"><span class="ln">1595 </span></a><span class="s0">likenesses? You know nothing of drawing.  Don't pretend to be</span>
<a name="l1596"><span class="ln">1596 </span></a><span class="s0">in raptures about mine.  Keep your raptures for Harriet's face.</span>
<a name="l1597"><span class="ln">1597 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe</span>
<a name="l1598"><span class="ln">1598 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall try what I can do.  Harriet's features are very delicate,</span>
<a name="l1599"><span class="ln">1599 </span></a><span class="s0">which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity</span>
<a name="l1600"><span class="ln">1600 </span></a><span class="s0">in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought</span>
<a name="l1601"><span class="ln">1601 </span></a><span class="s0">to catch.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1602"><span class="ln">1602 </span></a>
<a name="l1603"><span class="ln">1603 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I</span>
<a name="l1604"><span class="ln">1604 </span></a><span class="s0">have not a doubt of your success.  Pray, pray attempt it.</span>
<a name="l1605"><span class="ln">1605 </span></a><span class="s0">As you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words,</span>
<a name="l1606"><span class="ln">1606 </span></a><span class="s0">be an exquisite possession.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1607"><span class="ln">1607 </span></a>
<a name="l1608"><span class="ln">1608 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit.</span>
<a name="l1609"><span class="ln">1609 </span></a><span class="s0">She thinks so little of her own beauty.  Did not you observe her</span>
<a name="l1610"><span class="ln">1610 </span></a><span class="s0">manner of answering me? How completely it meant, `why should my</span>
<a name="l1611"><span class="ln">1611 </span></a><span class="s0">picture be drawn?'&quot;</span>
<a name="l1612"><span class="ln">1612 </span></a>
<a name="l1613"><span class="ln">1613 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you.  It was not lost on me.</span>
<a name="l1614"><span class="ln">1614 </span></a><span class="s0">But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1615"><span class="ln">1615 </span></a>
<a name="l1616"><span class="ln">1616 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;</span>
<a name="l1617"><span class="ln">1617 </span></a><span class="s0">and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest</span>
<a name="l1618"><span class="ln">1618 </span></a><span class="s0">pressing of both the others.  Emma wished to go to work directly,</span>
<a name="l1619"><span class="ln">1619 </span></a><span class="s0">and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts</span>
<a name="l1620"><span class="ln">1620 </span></a><span class="s0">at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they</span>
<a name="l1621"><span class="ln">1621 </span></a><span class="s0">might decide together on the best size for Harriet.  Her many</span>
<a name="l1622"><span class="ln">1622 </span></a><span class="s0">beginnings were displayed.  Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,</span>
<a name="l1623"><span class="ln">1623 </span></a><span class="s0">pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn.</span>
<a name="l1624"><span class="ln">1624 </span></a><span class="s0">She had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress</span>
<a name="l1625"><span class="ln">1625 </span></a><span class="s0">both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little</span>
<a name="l1626"><span class="ln">1626 </span></a><span class="s0">labour as she would ever submit to.  She played and sang;--and drew</span>
<a name="l1627"><span class="ln">1627 </span></a><span class="s0">in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting;</span>
<a name="l1628"><span class="ln">1628 </span></a><span class="s0">and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she</span>
<a name="l1629"><span class="ln">1629 </span></a><span class="s0">would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.</span>
<a name="l1630"><span class="ln">1630 </span></a><span class="s0">She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist</span>
<a name="l1631"><span class="ln">1631 </span></a><span class="s0">or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,</span>
<a name="l1632"><span class="ln">1632 </span></a><span class="s0">or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher</span>
<a name="l1633"><span class="ln">1633 </span></a><span class="s0">than it deserved.</span>
<a name="l1634"><span class="ln">1634 </span></a>
<a name="l1635"><span class="ln">1635 </span></a><span class="s0">There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the most;</span>
<a name="l1636"><span class="ln">1636 </span></a><span class="s0">her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there</span>
<a name="l1637"><span class="ln">1637 </span></a><span class="s0">been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions</span>
<a name="l1638"><span class="ln">1638 </span></a><span class="s0">would have been the same.  They were both in ecstasies.  A likeness</span>
<a name="l1639"><span class="ln">1639 </span></a><span class="s0">pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.</span>
<a name="l1640"><span class="ln">1640 </span></a>
<a name="l1641"><span class="ln">1641 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No great variety of faces for you,&quot; said Emma.  &quot;I had only my</span>
<a name="l1642"><span class="ln">1642 </span></a><span class="s0">own family to study from.  There is my father--another of my</span>
<a name="l1643"><span class="ln">1643 </span></a><span class="s0">father--but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,</span>
<a name="l1644"><span class="ln">1644 </span></a><span class="s0">that I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very</span>
<a name="l1645"><span class="ln">1645 </span></a><span class="s0">like therefore.  Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see.</span>
<a name="l1646"><span class="ln">1646 </span></a><span class="s0">Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion.</span>
<a name="l1647"><span class="ln">1647 </span></a><span class="s0">She would sit whenever I asked her.  There is my sister; and really</span>
<a name="l1648"><span class="ln">1648 </span></a><span class="s0">quite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike.</span>
<a name="l1649"><span class="ln">1649 </span></a><span class="s0">I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have</span>
<a name="l1650"><span class="ln">1650 </span></a><span class="s0">sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four</span>
<a name="l1651"><span class="ln">1651 </span></a><span class="s0">children that she would not be quiet.  Then, here come all my</span>
<a name="l1652"><span class="ln">1652 </span></a><span class="s0">attempts at three of those four children;--there they are,</span>
<a name="l1653"><span class="ln">1653 </span></a><span class="s0">Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other,</span>
<a name="l1654"><span class="ln">1654 </span></a><span class="s0">and any one of them might do for any one of the rest.  She was so</span>
<a name="l1655"><span class="ln">1655 </span></a><span class="s0">eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no</span>
<a name="l1656"><span class="ln">1656 </span></a><span class="s0">making children of three or four years old stand still you know;</span>
<a name="l1657"><span class="ln">1657 </span></a><span class="s0">nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the</span>
<a name="l1658"><span class="ln">1658 </span></a><span class="s0">air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any</span>
<a name="l1659"><span class="ln">1659 </span></a><span class="s0">of mama's children ever were.  Here is my sketch of the fourth,</span>
<a name="l1660"><span class="ln">1660 </span></a><span class="s0">who was a baby.  I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it</span>
<a name="l1661"><span class="ln">1661 </span></a><span class="s0">is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.</span>
<a name="l1662"><span class="ln">1662 </span></a><span class="s0">He had nestled down his head most conveniently.  That's very like.</span>
<a name="l1663"><span class="ln">1663 </span></a><span class="s0">I am rather proud of little George.  The corner of the sofa is very good.</span>
<a name="l1664"><span class="ln">1664 </span></a><span class="s0">Then here is my last,&quot;--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman</span>
<a name="l1665"><span class="ln">1665 </span></a><span class="s0">in small size, whole-length--&quot;my last and my best--my brother,</span>
<a name="l1666"><span class="ln">1666 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I</span>
<a name="l1667"><span class="ln">1667 </span></a><span class="s0">put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness.</span>
<a name="l1668"><span class="ln">1668 </span></a><span class="s0">I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I</span>
<a name="l1669"><span class="ln">1669 </span></a><span class="s0">had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I</span>
<a name="l1670"><span class="ln">1670 </span></a><span class="s0">were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too</span>
<a name="l1671"><span class="ln">1671 </span></a><span class="s0">flattering--but that was a fault on the right side--after</span>
<a name="l1672"><span class="ln">1672 </span></a><span class="s0">all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of--&quot;Yes,</span>
<a name="l1673"><span class="ln">1673 </span></a><span class="s0">it was a little like--but to be sure it did not do him justice.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1674"><span class="ln">1674 </span></a><span class="s0">We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all.</span>
<a name="l1675"><span class="ln">1675 </span></a><span class="s0">It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I</span>
<a name="l1676"><span class="ln">1676 </span></a><span class="s0">could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised</span>
<a name="l1677"><span class="ln">1677 </span></a><span class="s0">over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in</span>
<a name="l1678"><span class="ln">1678 </span></a><span class="s0">Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing</span>
<a name="l1679"><span class="ln">1679 </span></a><span class="s0">any body again.  But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own,</span>
<a name="l1680"><span class="ln">1680 </span></a><span class="s0">and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_,</span>
<a name="l1681"><span class="ln">1681 </span></a><span class="s0">I will break my resolution now.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1682"><span class="ln">1682 </span></a>
<a name="l1683"><span class="ln">1683 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea,</span>
<a name="l1684"><span class="ln">1684 </span></a><span class="s0">and was repeating, &quot;No husbands and wives in the case at present</span>
<a name="l1685"><span class="ln">1685 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed, as you observe.  Exactly so.  No husbands and wives,&quot;</span>
<a name="l1686"><span class="ln">1686 </span></a><span class="s0">with so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider</span>
<a name="l1687"><span class="ln">1687 </span></a><span class="s0">whether she had not better leave them together at once.  But as she</span>
<a name="l1688"><span class="ln">1688 </span></a><span class="s0">wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.</span>
<a name="l1689"><span class="ln">1689 </span></a>
<a name="l1690"><span class="ln">1690 </span></a><span class="s0">She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait.</span>
<a name="l1691"><span class="ln">1691 </span></a><span class="s0">It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John</span>
<a name="l1692"><span class="ln">1692 </span></a><span class="s0">Knightley's, and was destined, if she could please herself,</span>
<a name="l1693"><span class="ln">1693 </span></a><span class="s0">to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.</span>
<a name="l1694"><span class="ln">1694 </span></a>
<a name="l1695"><span class="ln">1695 </span></a><span class="s0">The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid</span>
<a name="l1696"><span class="ln">1696 </span></a><span class="s0">of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet</span>
<a name="l1697"><span class="ln">1697 </span></a><span class="s0">mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist.</span>
<a name="l1698"><span class="ln">1698 </span></a><span class="s0">But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind</span>
<a name="l1699"><span class="ln">1699 </span></a><span class="s0">her and watching every touch.  She gave him credit for stationing</span>
<a name="l1700"><span class="ln">1700 </span></a><span class="s0">himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence;</span>
<a name="l1701"><span class="ln">1701 </span></a><span class="s0">but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to</span>
<a name="l1702"><span class="ln">1702 </span></a><span class="s0">place himself elsewhere.  It then occurred to her to employ him</span>
<a name="l1703"><span class="ln">1703 </span></a><span class="s0">in reading.</span>
<a name="l1704"><span class="ln">1704 </span></a>
<a name="l1705"><span class="ln">1705 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness</span>
<a name="l1706"><span class="ln">1706 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen</span>
<a name="l1707"><span class="ln">1707 </span></a><span class="s0">the irksomeness of Miss Smith's.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1708"><span class="ln">1708 </span></a>
<a name="l1709"><span class="ln">1709 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton was only too happy.  Harriet listened, and Emma drew</span>
<a name="l1710"><span class="ln">1710 </span></a><span class="s0">in peace.  She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look;</span>
<a name="l1711"><span class="ln">1711 </span></a><span class="s0">any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover;</span>
<a name="l1712"><span class="ln">1712 </span></a><span class="s0">and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil,</span>
<a name="l1713"><span class="ln">1713 </span></a><span class="s0">to jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.--There was no</span>
<a name="l1714"><span class="ln">1714 </span></a><span class="s0">being displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration</span>
<a name="l1715"><span class="ln">1715 </span></a><span class="s0">made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible.</span>
<a name="l1716"><span class="ln">1716 </span></a><span class="s0">She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance</span>
<a name="l1717"><span class="ln">1717 </span></a><span class="s0">were unexceptionable.</span>
<a name="l1718"><span class="ln">1718 </span></a>
<a name="l1719"><span class="ln">1719 </span></a><span class="s0">The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite</span>
<a name="l1720"><span class="ln">1720 </span></a><span class="s0">enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on.</span>
<a name="l1721"><span class="ln">1721 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude,</span>
<a name="l1722"><span class="ln">1722 </span></a><span class="s0">and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure,</span>
<a name="l1723"><span class="ln">1723 </span></a><span class="s0">to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had</span>
<a name="l1724"><span class="ln">1724 </span></a><span class="s0">great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last,</span>
<a name="l1725"><span class="ln">1725 </span></a><span class="s0">and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a</span>
<a name="l1726"><span class="ln">1726 </span></a><span class="s0">standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other,</span>
<a name="l1727"><span class="ln">1727 </span></a><span class="s0">and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations</span>
<a name="l1728"><span class="ln">1728 </span></a><span class="s0">as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add.</span>
<a name="l1729"><span class="ln">1729 </span></a>
<a name="l1730"><span class="ln">1730 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,</span>
<a name="l1731"><span class="ln">1731 </span></a><span class="s0">entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.</span>
<a name="l1732"><span class="ln">1732 </span></a>
<a name="l1733"><span class="ln">1733 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;By all means.  We shall be most happy to consider you as one</span>
<a name="l1734"><span class="ln">1734 </span></a><span class="s0">of the party.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1735"><span class="ln">1735 </span></a>
<a name="l1736"><span class="ln">1736 </span></a><span class="s0">The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,</span>
<a name="l1737"><span class="ln">1737 </span></a><span class="s0">took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress</span>
<a name="l1738"><span class="ln">1738 </span></a><span class="s0">of the picture, which was rapid and happy.  Every body who saw it</span>
<a name="l1739"><span class="ln">1739 </span></a><span class="s0">was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended</span>
<a name="l1740"><span class="ln">1740 </span></a><span class="s0">it through every criticism.</span>
<a name="l1741"><span class="ln">1741 </span></a>
<a name="l1742"><span class="ln">1742 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she</span>
<a name="l1743"><span class="ln">1743 </span></a><span class="s0">wanted,&quot;--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting</span>
<a name="l1744"><span class="ln">1744 </span></a><span class="s0">that she was addressing a lover.--&quot;The expression of the eye is</span>
<a name="l1745"><span class="ln">1745 </span></a><span class="s0">most correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes.</span>
<a name="l1746"><span class="ln">1746 </span></a><span class="s0">It is the fault of her face that she has them not.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1747"><span class="ln">1747 </span></a>
<a name="l1748"><span class="ln">1748 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Do you think so?&quot; replied he.  &quot;I cannot agree with you.</span>
<a name="l1749"><span class="ln">1749 </span></a><span class="s0">It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature.</span>
<a name="l1750"><span class="ln">1750 </span></a><span class="s0">I never saw such a likeness in my life.  We must allow for the effect</span>
<a name="l1751"><span class="ln">1751 </span></a><span class="s0">of shade, you know.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1752"><span class="ln">1752 </span></a>
<a name="l1753"><span class="ln">1753 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You have made her too tall, Emma,&quot; said Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l1754"><span class="ln">1754 </span></a>
<a name="l1755"><span class="ln">1755 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,</span>
<a name="l1756"><span class="ln">1756 </span></a>
<a name="l1757"><span class="ln">1757 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall.  Consider,</span>
<a name="l1758"><span class="ln">1758 </span></a><span class="s0">she is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which</span>
<a name="l1759"><span class="ln">1759 </span></a><span class="s0">in short gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must</span>
<a name="l1760"><span class="ln">1760 </span></a><span class="s0">be preserved, you know.  Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it</span>
<a name="l1761"><span class="ln">1761 </span></a><span class="s0">gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!&quot;</span>
<a name="l1762"><span class="ln">1762 </span></a>
<a name="l1763"><span class="ln">1763 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is very pretty,&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse.  &quot;So prettily done! Just</span>
<a name="l1764"><span class="ln">1764 </span></a><span class="s0">as your drawings always are, my dear.  I do not know any body who draws</span>
<a name="l1765"><span class="ln">1765 </span></a><span class="s0">so well as you do.  The only thing I do not thoroughly like is,</span>
<a name="l1766"><span class="ln">1766 </span></a><span class="s0">that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl</span>
<a name="l1767"><span class="ln">1767 </span></a><span class="s0">over her shoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1768"><span class="ln">1768 </span></a>
<a name="l1769"><span class="ln">1769 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.</span>
<a name="l1770"><span class="ln">1770 </span></a><span class="s0">Look at the tree.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1771"><span class="ln">1771 </span></a>
<a name="l1772"><span class="ln">1772 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1773"><span class="ln">1773 </span></a>
<a name="l1774"><span class="ln">1774 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You, sir, may say any thing,&quot; cried Mr. Elton, &quot;but I must confess</span>
<a name="l1775"><span class="ln">1775 </span></a><span class="s0">that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss</span>
<a name="l1776"><span class="ln">1776 </span></a><span class="s0">Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable</span>
<a name="l1777"><span class="ln">1777 </span></a><span class="s0">spirit! Any other situation would have been much less in character.</span>
<a name="l1778"><span class="ln">1778 </span></a><span class="s0">The naivete of Miss Smith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is</span>
<a name="l1779"><span class="ln">1779 </span></a><span class="s0">most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it.  I never saw such</span>
<a name="l1780"><span class="ln">1780 </span></a><span class="s0">a likeness.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1781"><span class="ln">1781 </span></a>
<a name="l1782"><span class="ln">1782 </span></a><span class="s0">The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a</span>
<a name="l1783"><span class="ln">1783 </span></a><span class="s0">few difficulties.  It must be done directly; it must be done in London;</span>
<a name="l1784"><span class="ln">1784 </span></a><span class="s0">the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste</span>
<a name="l1785"><span class="ln">1785 </span></a><span class="s0">could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,</span>
<a name="l1786"><span class="ln">1786 </span></a><span class="s0">must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l1787"><span class="ln">1787 </span></a><span class="s0">could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs</span>
<a name="l1788"><span class="ln">1788 </span></a><span class="s0">of December.  But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton,</span>
<a name="l1789"><span class="ln">1789 </span></a><span class="s0">than it was removed.  His gallantry was always on the alert.</span>
<a name="l1790"><span class="ln">1790 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure</span>
<a name="l1791"><span class="ln">1791 </span></a><span class="s0">should he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time.</span>
<a name="l1792"><span class="ln">1792 </span></a><span class="s0">It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being</span>
<a name="l1793"><span class="ln">1793 </span></a><span class="s0">employed on such an errand.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1794"><span class="ln">1794 </span></a>
<a name="l1795"><span class="ln">1795 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would</span>
<a name="l1796"><span class="ln">1796 </span></a><span class="s0">not give him such a troublesome office for the world,&quot;--brought</span>

<a name="l1798"><span class="ln">1798 </span></a><span class="s0">a very few minutes settled the business.</span>
<a name="l1799"><span class="ln">1799 </span></a>
<a name="l1800"><span class="ln">1800 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,</span>
<a name="l1801"><span class="ln">1801 </span></a><span class="s0">and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it</span>
<a name="l1802"><span class="ln">1802 </span></a><span class="s0">as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he</span>
<a name="l1803"><span class="ln">1803 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.</span>
<a name="l1804"><span class="ln">1804 </span></a>
<a name="l1805"><span class="ln">1805 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What a precious deposit!&quot; said he with a tender sigh, as he</span>
<a name="l1806"><span class="ln">1806 </span></a><span class="s0">received it.</span>
<a name="l1807"><span class="ln">1807 </span></a>
<a name="l1808"><span class="ln">1808 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This man is almost too gallant to be in love,&quot; thought Emma.</span>
<a name="l1809"><span class="ln">1809 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different</span>
<a name="l1810"><span class="ln">1810 </span></a><span class="s0">ways of being in love.  He is an excellent young man, and will suit</span>
<a name="l1811"><span class="ln">1811 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet exactly; it will be an `Exactly so,' as he says himself;</span>
<a name="l1812"><span class="ln">1812 </span></a><span class="s0">but he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more</span>
<a name="l1813"><span class="ln">1813 </span></a><span class="s0">than I could endure as a principal.  I come in for a pretty good</span>
<a name="l1814"><span class="ln">1814 </span></a><span class="s0">share as a second.  But it is his gratitude on Harriet's account.&quot;</span>

<a name="l1820"><span class="ln">1820 </span></a>
<a name="l1821"><span class="ln">1821 </span></a><span class="s0">The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion</span>
<a name="l1822"><span class="ln">1822 </span></a><span class="s0">for Emma's services towards her friend.  Harriet had been at Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l1823"><span class="ln">1823 </span></a><span class="s0">as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home</span>
<a name="l1824"><span class="ln">1824 </span></a><span class="s0">to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been</span>
<a name="l1825"><span class="ln">1825 </span></a><span class="s0">talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something</span>
<a name="l1826"><span class="ln">1826 </span></a><span class="s0">extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell.</span>
<a name="l1827"><span class="ln">1827 </span></a><span class="s0">Half a minute brought it all out.  She had heard, as soon as she got</span>
<a name="l1828"><span class="ln">1828 </span></a><span class="s0">back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before,</span>
<a name="l1829"><span class="ln">1829 </span></a><span class="s0">and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left</span>
<a name="l1830"><span class="ln">1830 </span></a><span class="s0">a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away;</span>
<a name="l1831"><span class="ln">1831 </span></a><span class="s0">and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two</span>
<a name="l1832"><span class="ln">1832 </span></a><span class="s0">songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself;</span>
<a name="l1833"><span class="ln">1833 </span></a><span class="s0">and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct</span>
<a name="l1834"><span class="ln">1834 </span></a><span class="s0">proposal of marriage.  &quot;Who could have thought it? She was so surprized</span>
<a name="l1835"><span class="ln">1835 </span></a><span class="s0">she did not know what to do.  Yes, quite a proposal of marriage;</span>
<a name="l1836"><span class="ln">1836 </span></a><span class="s0">and a very good letter, at least she thought so.  And he wrote</span>
<a name="l1837"><span class="ln">1837 </span></a><span class="s0">as if he really loved her very much--but she did not know--and so,</span>
<a name="l1838"><span class="ln">1838 </span></a><span class="s0">she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she</span>
<a name="l1839"><span class="ln">1839 </span></a><span class="s0">should do.--&quot; Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so</span>
<a name="l1840"><span class="ln">1840 </span></a><span class="s0">pleased and so doubtful.</span>
<a name="l1841"><span class="ln">1841 </span></a>
<a name="l1842"><span class="ln">1842 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon my word,&quot; she cried, &quot;the young man is determined not to lose</span>
<a name="l1843"><span class="ln">1843 </span></a><span class="s0">any thing for want of asking.  He will connect himself well if he can.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1844"><span class="ln">1844 </span></a>
<a name="l1845"><span class="ln">1845 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Will you read the letter?&quot; cried Harriet.  &quot;Pray do.  I'd rather</span>
<a name="l1846"><span class="ln">1846 </span></a><span class="s0">you would.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1847"><span class="ln">1847 </span></a>
<a name="l1848"><span class="ln">1848 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was not sorry to be pressed.  She read, and was surprized.</span>
<a name="l1849"><span class="ln">1849 </span></a><span class="s0">The style of the letter was much above her expectation.</span>
<a name="l1850"><span class="ln">1850 </span></a><span class="s0">There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it</span>
<a name="l1851"><span class="ln">1851 </span></a><span class="s0">would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain,</span>
<a name="l1852"><span class="ln">1852 </span></a><span class="s0">was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much</span>
<a name="l1853"><span class="ln">1853 </span></a><span class="s0">to the credit of the writer.  It was short, but expressed good sense,</span>
<a name="l1854"><span class="ln">1854 </span></a><span class="s0">warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.</span>
<a name="l1855"><span class="ln">1855 </span></a><span class="s0">She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for</span>
<a name="l1856"><span class="ln">1856 </span></a><span class="s0">her opinion, with a &quot;Well, well,&quot; and was at last forced to add,</span>
<a name="l1857"><span class="ln">1857 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Is it a good letter? or is it too short?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1858"><span class="ln">1858 </span></a>
<a name="l1859"><span class="ln">1859 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, indeed, a very good letter,&quot; replied Emma rather slowly--&quot;so</span>
<a name="l1860"><span class="ln">1860 </span></a><span class="s0">good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of</span>
<a name="l1861"><span class="ln">1861 </span></a><span class="s0">his sisters must have helped him.  I can hardly imagine the young</span>
<a name="l1862"><span class="ln">1862 </span></a><span class="s0">man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself</span>
<a name="l1863"><span class="ln">1863 </span></a><span class="s0">so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the</span>
<a name="l1864"><span class="ln">1864 </span></a><span class="s0">style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise;</span>
<a name="l1865"><span class="ln">1865 </span></a><span class="s0">not diffuse enough for a woman.  No doubt he is a sensible man,</span>
<a name="l1866"><span class="ln">1866 </span></a><span class="s0">and I suppose may have a natural talent for--thinks strongly and</span>
<a name="l1867"><span class="ln">1867 </span></a><span class="s0">clearly--and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find</span>
<a name="l1868"><span class="ln">1868 </span></a><span class="s0">proper words.  It is so with some men.  Yes, I understand the sort</span>
<a name="l1869"><span class="ln">1869 </span></a><span class="s0">of mind.  Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point,</span>
<a name="l1870"><span class="ln">1870 </span></a><span class="s0">not coarse.  A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,)</span>
<a name="l1871"><span class="ln">1871 </span></a><span class="s0">than I had expected.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1872"><span class="ln">1872 </span></a>
<a name="l1873"><span class="ln">1873 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said the still waiting Harriet;--&quot;well--and--and what</span>
<a name="l1874"><span class="ln">1874 </span></a><span class="s0">shall I do?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1875"><span class="ln">1875 </span></a>
<a name="l1876"><span class="ln">1876 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard</span>
<a name="l1877"><span class="ln">1877 </span></a><span class="s0">to this letter?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1878"><span class="ln">1878 </span></a>
<a name="l1879"><span class="ln">1879 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1880"><span class="ln">1880 </span></a>
<a name="l1881"><span class="ln">1881 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and speedily.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1882"><span class="ln">1882 </span></a>
<a name="l1883"><span class="ln">1883 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1884"><span class="ln">1884 </span></a>
<a name="l1885"><span class="ln">1885 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own.  You will</span>
<a name="l1886"><span class="ln">1886 </span></a><span class="s0">express yourself very properly, I am sure.  There is no danger of your</span>
<a name="l1887"><span class="ln">1887 </span></a><span class="s0">not being intelligible, which is the first thing.  Your meaning must</span>
<a name="l1888"><span class="ln">1888 </span></a><span class="s0">be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude</span>
<a name="l1889"><span class="ln">1889 </span></a><span class="s0">and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires,</span>
<a name="l1890"><span class="ln">1890 </span></a><span class="s0">will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded.</span>
<a name="l1891"><span class="ln">1891 </span></a><span class="s0">You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow</span>
<a name="l1892"><span class="ln">1892 </span></a><span class="s0">for his disappointment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1893"><span class="ln">1893 </span></a>
<a name="l1894"><span class="ln">1894 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You think I ought to refuse him then,&quot; said Harriet, looking down.</span>
<a name="l1895"><span class="ln">1895 </span></a>
<a name="l1896"><span class="ln">1896 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you</span>
<a name="l1897"><span class="ln">1897 </span></a><span class="s0">in any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I</span>
<a name="l1898"><span class="ln">1898 </span></a><span class="s0">have been under a mistake.  I certainly have been misunderstanding</span>
<a name="l1899"><span class="ln">1899 </span></a><span class="s0">you, if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer.</span>
<a name="l1900"><span class="ln">1900 </span></a><span class="s0">I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1901"><span class="ln">1901 </span></a>
<a name="l1902"><span class="ln">1902 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was silent.  With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:</span>
<a name="l1903"><span class="ln">1903 </span></a>
<a name="l1904"><span class="ln">1904 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1905"><span class="ln">1905 </span></a>
<a name="l1906"><span class="ln">1906 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would</span>
<a name="l1907"><span class="ln">1907 </span></a><span class="s0">you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I</span>
<a name="l1908"><span class="ln">1908 </span></a><span class="s0">ought to do.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1909"><span class="ln">1909 </span></a>
<a name="l1910"><span class="ln">1910 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I shall not give you any advice, Harriet.  I will have nothing to</span>
<a name="l1911"><span class="ln">1911 </span></a><span class="s0">do with it.  This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1912"><span class="ln">1912 </span></a>
<a name="l1913"><span class="ln">1913 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I had no notion that he liked me so very much,&quot; said Harriet,</span>
<a name="l1914"><span class="ln">1914 </span></a><span class="s0">contemplating the letter.  For a little while Emma persevered</span>
<a name="l1915"><span class="ln">1915 </span></a><span class="s0">in her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery</span>
<a name="l1916"><span class="ln">1916 </span></a><span class="s0">of that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,</span>
<a name="l1917"><span class="ln">1917 </span></a>
<a name="l1918"><span class="ln">1918 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_</span>
<a name="l1919"><span class="ln">1919 </span></a><span class="s0">as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought</span>
<a name="l1920"><span class="ln">1920 </span></a><span class="s0">to refuse him.  If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought to say</span>
<a name="l1921"><span class="ln">1921 </span></a><span class="s0">`No' directly.  It is not a state to be safely entered into</span>
<a name="l1922"><span class="ln">1922 </span></a><span class="s0">with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.  I thought it my duty</span>
<a name="l1923"><span class="ln">1923 </span></a><span class="s0">as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you.</span>
<a name="l1924"><span class="ln">1924 </span></a><span class="s0">But do not imagine that I want to influence you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1925"><span class="ln">1925 </span></a>
<a name="l1926"><span class="ln">1926 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you</span>
<a name="l1927"><span class="ln">1927 </span></a><span class="s0">would just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean</span>
<a name="l1928"><span class="ln">1928 </span></a><span class="s0">that--As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should</span>
<a name="l1929"><span class="ln">1929 </span></a><span class="s0">not be hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer</span>
<a name="l1930"><span class="ln">1930 </span></a><span class="s0">to say `No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?'&quot;</span>
<a name="l1931"><span class="ln">1931 </span></a>
<a name="l1932"><span class="ln">1932 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not for the world,&quot; said Emma, smiling graciously, &quot;would I advise</span>
<a name="l1933"><span class="ln">1933 </span></a><span class="s0">you either way.  You must be the best judge of your own happiness.</span>
<a name="l1934"><span class="ln">1934 </span></a><span class="s0">If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him</span>
<a name="l1935"><span class="ln">1935 </span></a><span class="s0">the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should</span>
<a name="l1936"><span class="ln">1936 </span></a><span class="s0">you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you</span>
<a name="l1937"><span class="ln">1937 </span></a><span class="s0">at this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not</span>
<a name="l1938"><span class="ln">1938 </span></a><span class="s0">deceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion.</span>
<a name="l1939"><span class="ln">1939 </span></a><span class="s0">At this moment whom are you thinking of?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1940"><span class="ln">1940 </span></a>
<a name="l1941"><span class="ln">1941 </span></a><span class="s0">The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned</span>
<a name="l1942"><span class="ln">1942 </span></a><span class="s0">away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though</span>
<a name="l1943"><span class="ln">1943 </span></a><span class="s0">the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted</span>
<a name="l1944"><span class="ln">1944 </span></a><span class="s0">about without regard.  Emma waited the result with impatience,</span>
<a name="l1945"><span class="ln">1945 </span></a><span class="s0">but not without strong hopes.  At last, with some hesitation,</span>
<a name="l1946"><span class="ln">1946 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet said--</span>
<a name="l1947"><span class="ln">1947 </span></a>
<a name="l1948"><span class="ln">1948 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must</span>
<a name="l1949"><span class="ln">1949 </span></a><span class="s0">do as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined,</span>
<a name="l1950"><span class="ln">1950 </span></a><span class="s0">and really almost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin.  Do you</span>
<a name="l1951"><span class="ln">1951 </span></a><span class="s0">think I am right?&quot;</span>
<a name="l1952"><span class="ln">1952 </span></a>
<a name="l1953"><span class="ln">1953 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just</span>
<a name="l1954"><span class="ln">1954 </span></a><span class="s0">what you ought.  While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings</span>
<a name="l1955"><span class="ln">1955 </span></a><span class="s0">to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no</span>
<a name="l1956"><span class="ln">1956 </span></a><span class="s0">hesitation in approving.  Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this.</span>
<a name="l1957"><span class="ln">1957 </span></a><span class="s0">It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have</span>
<a name="l1958"><span class="ln">1958 </span></a><span class="s0">been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.  While you were in</span>
<a name="l1959"><span class="ln">1959 </span></a><span class="s0">the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would</span>
<a name="l1960"><span class="ln">1960 </span></a><span class="s0">not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me.</span>
<a name="l1961"><span class="ln">1961 </span></a><span class="s0">I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm.</span>
<a name="l1962"><span class="ln">1962 </span></a><span class="s0">Now I am secure of you for ever.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1963"><span class="ln">1963 </span></a>
<a name="l1964"><span class="ln">1964 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck</span>
<a name="l1965"><span class="ln">1965 </span></a><span class="s0">her forcibly.</span>
<a name="l1966"><span class="ln">1966 </span></a>
<a name="l1967"><span class="ln">1967 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You could not have visited me!&quot; she cried, looking aghast.</span>
<a name="l1968"><span class="ln">1968 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.</span>
<a name="l1969"><span class="ln">1969 </span></a><span class="s0">That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l1970"><span class="ln">1970 </span></a><span class="s0">I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you</span>
<a name="l1971"><span class="ln">1971 </span></a><span class="s0">for any thing in the world.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1972"><span class="ln">1972 </span></a>
<a name="l1973"><span class="ln">1973 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you;</span>
<a name="l1974"><span class="ln">1974 </span></a><span class="s0">but it must have been.  You would have thrown yourself out of all</span>
<a name="l1975"><span class="ln">1975 </span></a><span class="s0">good society.  I must have given you up.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1976"><span class="ln">1976 </span></a>

<a name="l1978"><span class="ln">1978 </span></a><span class="s0">me never to come to Hartfield any more!&quot;</span>
<a name="l1979"><span class="ln">1979 </span></a>

<a name="l1981"><span class="ln">1981 </span></a><span class="s0">confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!</span>
<a name="l1982"><span class="ln">1982 </span></a><span class="s0">I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it.</span>
<a name="l1983"><span class="ln">1983 </span></a><span class="s0">He must have a pretty good opinion of himself.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1984"><span class="ln">1984 </span></a>
<a name="l1985"><span class="ln">1985 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not think he is conceited either, in general,&quot; said Harriet,</span>
<a name="l1986"><span class="ln">1986 </span></a><span class="s0">her conscience opposing such censure; &quot;at least, he is very good natured,</span>
<a name="l1987"><span class="ln">1987 </span></a><span class="s0">and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard</span>
<a name="l1988"><span class="ln">1988 </span></a><span class="s0">for--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know,</span>
<a name="l1989"><span class="ln">1989 </span></a><span class="s0">though he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and</span>
<a name="l1990"><span class="ln">1990 </span></a><span class="s0">certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen</span>
<a name="l1991"><span class="ln">1991 </span></a><span class="s0">people--and if one comes to compare them, person and manners,</span>
<a name="l1992"><span class="ln">1992 </span></a><span class="s0">there is no comparison at all, _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable.</span>
<a name="l1993"><span class="ln">1993 </span></a><span class="s0">However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man,</span>
<a name="l1994"><span class="ln">1994 </span></a><span class="s0">and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached</span>
<a name="l1995"><span class="ln">1995 </span></a><span class="s0">to me--and his writing such a letter--but as to leaving you,</span>
<a name="l1996"><span class="ln">1996 </span></a><span class="s0">it is what I would not do upon any consideration.&quot;</span>
<a name="l1997"><span class="ln">1997 </span></a>
<a name="l1998"><span class="ln">1998 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.  We will not</span>
<a name="l1999"><span class="ln">1999 </span></a><span class="s0">be parted.  A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked,</span>
<a name="l2000"><span class="ln">2000 </span></a><span class="s0">or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2001"><span class="ln">2001 </span></a>
<a name="l2002"><span class="ln">2002 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2003"><span class="ln">2003 </span></a>
<a name="l2004"><span class="ln">2004 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a</span>
<a name="l2005"><span class="ln">2005 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the</span>
<a name="l2006"><span class="ln">2006 </span></a><span class="s0">clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day,</span>
<a name="l2007"><span class="ln">2007 </span></a><span class="s0">to know that her husband could write a good letter.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2008"><span class="ln">2008 </span></a>
<a name="l2009"><span class="ln">2009 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes, very.  Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always</span>
<a name="l2010"><span class="ln">2010 </span></a><span class="s0">happy with pleasant companions.  I am quite determined to refuse him.</span>
<a name="l2011"><span class="ln">2011 </span></a><span class="s0">But how shall I do? What shall I say?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2012"><span class="ln">2012 </span></a>
<a name="l2013"><span class="ln">2013 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer,</span>
<a name="l2014"><span class="ln">2014 </span></a><span class="s0">and advised its being written directly, which was agreed to,</span>
<a name="l2015"><span class="ln">2015 </span></a><span class="s0">in the hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest</span>
<a name="l2016"><span class="ln">2016 </span></a><span class="s0">against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the</span>
<a name="l2017"><span class="ln">2017 </span></a><span class="s0">formation of every sentence.  The looking over his letter again,</span>
<a name="l2018"><span class="ln">2018 </span></a><span class="s0">in replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was</span>
<a name="l2019"><span class="ln">2019 </span></a><span class="s0">particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions;</span>
<a name="l2020"><span class="ln">2020 </span></a><span class="s0">and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy,</span>
<a name="l2021"><span class="ln">2021 </span></a><span class="s0">and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say,</span>
<a name="l2022"><span class="ln">2022 </span></a><span class="s0">and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful,</span>
<a name="l2023"><span class="ln">2023 </span></a><span class="s0">that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment,</span>
<a name="l2024"><span class="ln">2024 </span></a><span class="s0">he would have been accepted after all.</span>
<a name="l2025"><span class="ln">2025 </span></a>
<a name="l2026"><span class="ln">2026 </span></a><span class="s0">This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.</span>
<a name="l2027"><span class="ln">2027 </span></a><span class="s0">The business was finished, and Harriet safe.  She was rather low</span>
<a name="l2028"><span class="ln">2028 </span></a><span class="s0">all the evening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets,</span>
<a name="l2029"><span class="ln">2029 </span></a><span class="s0">and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection,</span>
<a name="l2030"><span class="ln">2030 </span></a><span class="s0">sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.</span>
<a name="l2031"><span class="ln">2031 </span></a>
<a name="l2032"><span class="ln">2032 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,&quot; was said in rather</span>
<a name="l2033"><span class="ln">2033 </span></a><span class="s0">a sorrowful tone.</span>
<a name="l2034"><span class="ln">2034 </span></a>
<a name="l2035"><span class="ln">2035 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.</span>
<a name="l2036"><span class="ln">2036 </span></a><span class="s0">You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared</span>
<a name="l2037"><span class="ln">2037 </span></a><span class="s0">to Abbey-Mill.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2038"><span class="ln">2038 </span></a>
<a name="l2039"><span class="ln">2039 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy</span>
<a name="l2040"><span class="ln">2040 </span></a><span class="s0">but at Hartfield.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2041"><span class="ln">2041 </span></a>
<a name="l2042"><span class="ln">2042 </span></a><span class="s0">Some time afterwards it was, &quot;I think Mrs. Goddard would be very</span>
<a name="l2043"><span class="ln">2043 </span></a><span class="s0">much surprized if she knew what had happened.  I am sure Miss Nash</span>
<a name="l2044"><span class="ln">2044 </span></a><span class="s0">would--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married,</span>
<a name="l2045"><span class="ln">2045 </span></a><span class="s0">and it is only a linen-draper.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2046"><span class="ln">2046 </span></a>
<a name="l2047"><span class="ln">2047 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the</span>
<a name="l2048"><span class="ln">2048 </span></a><span class="s0">teacher of a school, Harriet.  I dare say Miss Nash would envy you</span>
<a name="l2049"><span class="ln">2049 </span></a><span class="s0">such an opportunity as this of being married.  Even this conquest</span>
<a name="l2050"><span class="ln">2050 </span></a><span class="s0">would appear valuable in her eyes.  As to any thing superior for you,</span>
<a name="l2051"><span class="ln">2051 </span></a><span class="s0">I suppose she is quite in the dark.  The attentions of a certain</span>
<a name="l2052"><span class="ln">2052 </span></a><span class="s0">person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet.</span>
<a name="l2053"><span class="ln">2053 </span></a><span class="s0">Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks</span>
<a name="l2054"><span class="ln">2054 </span></a><span class="s0">and manners have explained themselves.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2055"><span class="ln">2055 </span></a>
<a name="l2056"><span class="ln">2056 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering</span>
<a name="l2057"><span class="ln">2057 </span></a><span class="s0">that people should like her so much.  The idea of Mr. Elton was</span>
<a name="l2058"><span class="ln">2058 </span></a><span class="s0">certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted</span>
<a name="l2059"><span class="ln">2059 </span></a><span class="s0">again towards the rejected Mr. Martin.</span>
<a name="l2060"><span class="ln">2060 </span></a>
<a name="l2061"><span class="ln">2061 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Now he has got my letter,&quot; said she softly.  &quot;I wonder what they</span>
<a name="l2062"><span class="ln">2062 </span></a><span class="s0">are all doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy,</span>
<a name="l2063"><span class="ln">2063 </span></a><span class="s0">they will be unhappy too.  I hope he will not mind it so very much.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2064"><span class="ln">2064 </span></a>
<a name="l2065"><span class="ln">2065 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more</span>
<a name="l2066"><span class="ln">2066 </span></a><span class="s0">cheerfully employed,&quot; cried Emma.  &quot;At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l2067"><span class="ln">2067 </span></a><span class="s0">is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much</span>
<a name="l2068"><span class="ln">2068 </span></a><span class="s0">more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five</span>
<a name="l2069"><span class="ln">2069 </span></a><span class="s0">or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2070"><span class="ln">2070 </span></a>
<a name="l2071"><span class="ln">2071 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2072"><span class="ln">2072 </span></a>
<a name="l2073"><span class="ln">2073 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton.  No, my dear</span>
<a name="l2074"><span class="ln">2074 </span></a><span class="s0">little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be</span>
<a name="l2075"><span class="ln">2075 </span></a><span class="s0">in Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow.</span>
<a name="l2076"><span class="ln">2076 </span></a><span class="s0">It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight.</span>
<a name="l2077"><span class="ln">2077 </span></a><span class="s0">It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them,</span>
<a name="l2078"><span class="ln">2078 </span></a><span class="s0">it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature,</span>
<a name="l2079"><span class="ln">2079 </span></a><span class="s0">eager curiosity and warm prepossession.  How cheerful, how animated,</span>
<a name="l2080"><span class="ln">2080 </span></a><span class="s0">how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!&quot;</span>
<a name="l2081"><span class="ln">2081 </span></a>
<a name="l2082"><span class="ln">2082 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.</span>

<a name="l2087"><span class="ln">2087 </span></a>
<a name="l2088"><span class="ln">2088 </span></a>
<a name="l2089"><span class="ln">2089 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet slept at Hartfield that night.  For some weeks past she</span>
<a name="l2090"><span class="ln">2090 </span></a><span class="s0">had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually</span>
<a name="l2091"><span class="ln">2091 </span></a><span class="s0">getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma</span>
<a name="l2092"><span class="ln">2092 </span></a><span class="s0">judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her</span>
<a name="l2093"><span class="ln">2093 </span></a><span class="s0">with them as much as possible just at present.  She was obliged</span>
<a name="l2094"><span class="ln">2094 </span></a><span class="s0">to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's,</span>
<a name="l2095"><span class="ln">2095 </span></a><span class="s0">but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l2096"><span class="ln">2096 </span></a><span class="s0">to make a regular visit of some days.</span>
<a name="l2097"><span class="ln">2097 </span></a>
<a name="l2098"><span class="ln">2098 </span></a><span class="s0">While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with</span>
<a name="l2099"><span class="ln">2099 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up</span>
<a name="l2100"><span class="ln">2100 </span></a><span class="s0">his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it,</span>
<a name="l2101"><span class="ln">2101 </span></a><span class="s0">and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples</span>
<a name="l2102"><span class="ln">2102 </span></a><span class="s0">of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose.</span>
<a name="l2103"><span class="ln">2103 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering</span>
<a name="l2104"><span class="ln">2104 </span></a><span class="s0">by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted</span>
<a name="l2105"><span class="ln">2105 </span></a><span class="s0">apologies and civil hesitations of the other.</span>
<a name="l2106"><span class="ln">2106 </span></a>
<a name="l2107"><span class="ln">2107 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you</span>
<a name="l2108"><span class="ln">2108 </span></a><span class="s0">will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take</span>
<a name="l2109"><span class="ln">2109 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.  As the sun</span>
<a name="l2110"><span class="ln">2110 </span></a><span class="s0">is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can.</span>
<a name="l2111"><span class="ln">2111 </span></a><span class="s0">I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley.  We invalids think we</span>
<a name="l2112"><span class="ln">2112 </span></a><span class="s0">are privileged people.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2113"><span class="ln">2113 </span></a>
<a name="l2114"><span class="ln">2114 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2115"><span class="ln">2115 </span></a>
<a name="l2116"><span class="ln">2116 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter.  Emma will be happy</span>
<a name="l2117"><span class="ln">2117 </span></a><span class="s0">to entertain you.  And therefore I think I will beg your excuse</span>
<a name="l2118"><span class="ln">2118 </span></a><span class="s0">and take my three turns--my winter walk.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2119"><span class="ln">2119 </span></a>
<a name="l2120"><span class="ln">2120 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You cannot do better, sir.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2121"><span class="ln">2121 </span></a>
<a name="l2122"><span class="ln">2122 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l2123"><span class="ln">2123 </span></a><span class="s0">but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you;</span>
<a name="l2124"><span class="ln">2124 </span></a><span class="s0">and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2125"><span class="ln">2125 </span></a>
<a name="l2126"><span class="ln">2126 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I</span>
<a name="l2127"><span class="ln">2127 </span></a><span class="s0">think the sooner _you_ go the better.  I will fetch your greatcoat</span>
<a name="l2128"><span class="ln">2128 </span></a><span class="s0">and open the garden door for you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2129"><span class="ln">2129 </span></a>
<a name="l2130"><span class="ln">2130 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being</span>
<a name="l2131"><span class="ln">2131 </span></a><span class="s0">immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined</span>
<a name="l2132"><span class="ln">2132 </span></a><span class="s0">for more chat.  He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking</span>
<a name="l2133"><span class="ln">2133 </span></a><span class="s0">of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.</span>
<a name="l2134"><span class="ln">2134 </span></a>
<a name="l2135"><span class="ln">2135 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I cannot rate her beauty as you do,&quot; said he; &quot;but she is a</span>
<a name="l2136"><span class="ln">2136 </span></a><span class="s0">pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of</span>
<a name="l2137"><span class="ln">2137 </span></a><span class="s0">her disposition.  Her character depends upon those she is with;</span>
<a name="l2138"><span class="ln">2138 </span></a><span class="s0">but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2139"><span class="ln">2139 </span></a>
<a name="l2140"><span class="ln">2140 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2141"><span class="ln">2141 </span></a>
<a name="l2142"><span class="ln">2142 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Come,&quot; said he, &quot;you are anxious for a compliment, so I will</span>
<a name="l2143"><span class="ln">2143 </span></a><span class="s0">tell you that you have improved her.  You have cured her of her</span>
<a name="l2144"><span class="ln">2144 </span></a><span class="s0">school-girl's giggle; she really does you credit.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2145"><span class="ln">2145 </span></a>
<a name="l2146"><span class="ln">2146 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you.  I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I</span>
<a name="l2147"><span class="ln">2147 </span></a><span class="s0">had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow</span>
<a name="l2148"><span class="ln">2148 </span></a><span class="s0">praise where they may.  _You_ do not often overpower me with it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2149"><span class="ln">2149 </span></a>
<a name="l2150"><span class="ln">2150 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2151"><span class="ln">2151 </span></a>
<a name="l2152"><span class="ln">2152 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Almost every moment.  She has been gone longer already than</span>
<a name="l2153"><span class="ln">2153 </span></a><span class="s0">she intended.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2154"><span class="ln">2154 </span></a>
<a name="l2155"><span class="ln">2155 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2156"><span class="ln">2156 </span></a>
<a name="l2157"><span class="ln">2157 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!&quot;</span>
<a name="l2158"><span class="ln">2158 </span></a>
<a name="l2159"><span class="ln">2159 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2160"><span class="ln">2160 </span></a>
<a name="l2161"><span class="ln">2161 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore</span>
<a name="l2162"><span class="ln">2162 </span></a><span class="s0">said nothing.  He presently added, with a smile,</span>
<a name="l2163"><span class="ln">2163 </span></a>
<a name="l2164"><span class="ln">2164 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you</span>
<a name="l2165"><span class="ln">2165 </span></a><span class="s0">that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon</span>
<a name="l2166"><span class="ln">2166 </span></a><span class="s0">hear of something to her advantage.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2167"><span class="ln">2167 </span></a>
<a name="l2168"><span class="ln">2168 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed! how so? of what sort?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2169"><span class="ln">2169 </span></a>
<a name="l2170"><span class="ln">2170 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A very serious sort, I assure you;&quot; still smiling.</span>
<a name="l2171"><span class="ln">2171 </span></a>
<a name="l2172"><span class="ln">2172 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love</span>
<a name="l2173"><span class="ln">2173 </span></a><span class="s0">with her? Who makes you their confidant?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2174"><span class="ln">2174 </span></a>
<a name="l2175"><span class="ln">2175 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.</span>
<a name="l2176"><span class="ln">2176 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew</span>
<a name="l2177"><span class="ln">2177 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton looked up to him.</span>
<a name="l2178"><span class="ln">2178 </span></a>
<a name="l2179"><span class="ln">2179 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have reason to think,&quot; he replied, &quot;that Harriet Smith will</span>
<a name="l2180"><span class="ln">2180 </span></a><span class="s0">soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable</span>
<a name="l2181"><span class="ln">2181 </span></a><span class="s0">quarter:--Robert Martin is the man.  Her visit to Abbey-Mill,</span>
<a name="l2182"><span class="ln">2182 </span></a><span class="s0">this summer, seems to have done his business.  He is desperately</span>
<a name="l2183"><span class="ln">2183 </span></a><span class="s0">in love and means to marry her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2184"><span class="ln">2184 </span></a>
<a name="l2185"><span class="ln">2185 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He is very obliging,&quot; said Emma; &quot;but is he sure that Harriet</span>
<a name="l2186"><span class="ln">2186 </span></a><span class="s0">means to marry him?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2187"><span class="ln">2187 </span></a>
<a name="l2188"><span class="ln">2188 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, well, means to make her an offer then.  Will that do? He came</span>
<a name="l2189"><span class="ln">2189 </span></a><span class="s0">to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it.</span>
<a name="l2190"><span class="ln">2190 </span></a><span class="s0">He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and,</span>
<a name="l2191"><span class="ln">2191 </span></a><span class="s0">I believe, considers me as one of his best friends.  He came to ask</span>
<a name="l2192"><span class="ln">2192 </span></a><span class="s0">me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;</span>
<a name="l2193"><span class="ln">2193 </span></a><span class="s0">whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his</span>
<a name="l2194"><span class="ln">2194 </span></a><span class="s0">choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being</span>
<a name="l2195"><span class="ln">2195 </span></a><span class="s0">considered (especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line</span>
<a name="l2196"><span class="ln">2196 </span></a><span class="s0">of society above him.  I was very much pleased with all that he said.</span>
<a name="l2197"><span class="ln">2197 </span></a><span class="s0">I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin.</span>
<a name="l2198"><span class="ln">2198 </span></a><span class="s0">He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very</span>
<a name="l2199"><span class="ln">2199 </span></a><span class="s0">well judging.  He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans,</span>
<a name="l2200"><span class="ln">2200 </span></a><span class="s0">and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.  He is</span>
<a name="l2201"><span class="ln">2201 </span></a><span class="s0">an excellent young man, both as son and brother.  I had no hesitation</span>
<a name="l2202"><span class="ln">2202 </span></a><span class="s0">in advising him to marry.  He proved to me that he could afford it;</span>
<a name="l2203"><span class="ln">2203 </span></a><span class="s0">and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better.</span>
<a name="l2204"><span class="ln">2204 </span></a><span class="s0">I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy.</span>
<a name="l2205"><span class="ln">2205 </span></a><span class="s0">If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought</span>
<a name="l2206"><span class="ln">2206 </span></a><span class="s0">highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the</span>
<a name="l2207"><span class="ln">2207 </span></a><span class="s0">best friend and counsellor man ever had.  This happened the night</span>
<a name="l2208"><span class="ln">2208 </span></a><span class="s0">before last.  Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow</span>
<a name="l2209"><span class="ln">2209 </span></a><span class="s0">much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not</span>
<a name="l2210"><span class="ln">2210 </span></a><span class="s0">appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should</span>
<a name="l2211"><span class="ln">2211 </span></a><span class="s0">be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor,</span>
<a name="l2212"><span class="ln">2212 </span></a><span class="s0">without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2213"><span class="ln">2213 </span></a>
<a name="l2214"><span class="ln">2214 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Pray, Mr. Knightley,&quot; said Emma, who had been smiling to herself</span>
<a name="l2215"><span class="ln">2215 </span></a><span class="s0">through a great part of this speech, &quot;how do you know that Mr. Martin</span>
<a name="l2216"><span class="ln">2216 </span></a><span class="s0">did not speak yesterday?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2217"><span class="ln">2217 </span></a>
<a name="l2218"><span class="ln">2218 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied he, surprized, &quot;I do not absolutely know it;</span>
<a name="l2219"><span class="ln">2219 </span></a><span class="s0">but it may be inferred.  Was not she the whole day with you?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2220"><span class="ln">2220 </span></a>
<a name="l2221"><span class="ln">2221 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Come,&quot; said she, &quot;I will tell you something, in return for what</span>
<a name="l2222"><span class="ln">2222 </span></a><span class="s0">you have told me.  He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote,</span>
<a name="l2223"><span class="ln">2223 </span></a><span class="s0">and was refused.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2224"><span class="ln">2224 </span></a>
<a name="l2225"><span class="ln">2225 </span></a><span class="s0">This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed;</span>
<a name="l2226"><span class="ln">2226 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure,</span>
<a name="l2227"><span class="ln">2227 </span></a><span class="s0">as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,</span>
<a name="l2228"><span class="ln">2228 </span></a>
<a name="l2229"><span class="ln">2229 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her.</span>
<a name="l2230"><span class="ln">2230 </span></a><span class="s0">What is the foolish girl about?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2231"><span class="ln">2231 </span></a>
<a name="l2232"><span class="ln">2232 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! to be sure,&quot; cried Emma, &quot;it is always incomprehensible</span>
<a name="l2233"><span class="ln">2233 </span></a><span class="s0">to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.</span>
<a name="l2234"><span class="ln">2234 </span></a><span class="s0">A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2235"><span class="ln">2235 </span></a>
<a name="l2236"><span class="ln">2236 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing.  But what is</span>
<a name="l2237"><span class="ln">2237 </span></a><span class="s0">the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness,</span>
<a name="l2238"><span class="ln">2238 </span></a><span class="s0">if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2239"><span class="ln">2239 </span></a>
<a name="l2240"><span class="ln">2240 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2241"><span class="ln">2241 </span></a>
<a name="l2242"><span class="ln">2242 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too.  Emma, this is</span>
<a name="l2243"><span class="ln">2243 </span></a><span class="s0">your doing.  You persuaded her to refuse him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2244"><span class="ln">2244 </span></a>
<a name="l2245"><span class="ln">2245 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should</span>
<a name="l2246"><span class="ln">2246 </span></a><span class="s0">not feel that I had done wrong.  Mr. Martin is a very respectable</span>
<a name="l2247"><span class="ln">2247 </span></a><span class="s0">young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am</span>
<a name="l2248"><span class="ln">2248 </span></a><span class="s0">rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her.</span>
<a name="l2249"><span class="ln">2249 </span></a><span class="s0">By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples.  It is</span>
<a name="l2250"><span class="ln">2250 </span></a><span class="s0">a pity that they were ever got over.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2251"><span class="ln">2251 </span></a>
<a name="l2252"><span class="ln">2252 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not Harriet's equal!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;</span>
<a name="l2253"><span class="ln">2253 </span></a><span class="s0">and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, &quot;No, he</span>
<a name="l2254"><span class="ln">2254 </span></a><span class="s0">is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense</span>
<a name="l2255"><span class="ln">2255 </span></a><span class="s0">as in situation.  Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you.</span>
<a name="l2256"><span class="ln">2256 </span></a><span class="s0">What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education,</span>
<a name="l2257"><span class="ln">2257 </span></a><span class="s0">to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural</span>
<a name="l2258"><span class="ln">2258 </span></a><span class="s0">daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision</span>
<a name="l2259"><span class="ln">2259 </span></a><span class="s0">at all, and certainly no respectable relations.  She is known only</span>
<a name="l2260"><span class="ln">2260 </span></a><span class="s0">as parlour-boarder at a common school.  She is not a sensible girl,</span>
<a name="l2261"><span class="ln">2261 </span></a><span class="s0">nor a girl of any information.  She has been taught nothing useful,</span>
<a name="l2262"><span class="ln">2262 </span></a><span class="s0">and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.</span>
<a name="l2263"><span class="ln">2263 </span></a><span class="s0">At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,</span>
<a name="l2264"><span class="ln">2264 </span></a><span class="s0">is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her.</span>
<a name="l2265"><span class="ln">2265 </span></a><span class="s0">She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all.</span>
<a name="l2266"><span class="ln">2266 </span></a><span class="s0">My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being</span>
<a name="l2267"><span class="ln">2267 </span></a><span class="s0">beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.  I felt that,</span>
<a name="l2268"><span class="ln">2268 </span></a><span class="s0">as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as</span>
<a name="l2269"><span class="ln">2269 </span></a><span class="s0">to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.</span>
<a name="l2270"><span class="ln">2270 </span></a><span class="s0">But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing</span>
<a name="l2271"><span class="ln">2271 </span></a><span class="s0">to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort</span>
<a name="l2272"><span class="ln">2272 </span></a><span class="s0">of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led</span>
<a name="l2273"><span class="ln">2273 </span></a><span class="s0">aright and turn out very well.  The advantage of the match I felt</span>
<a name="l2274"><span class="ln">2274 </span></a><span class="s0">to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now)</span>
<a name="l2275"><span class="ln">2275 </span></a><span class="s0">that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck.</span>
<a name="l2276"><span class="ln">2276 </span></a><span class="s0">Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.  It crossed my mind immediately</span>
<a name="l2277"><span class="ln">2277 </span></a><span class="s0">that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the</span>
<a name="l2278"><span class="ln">2278 </span></a><span class="s0">sake of her being settled so well.  I remember saying to myself,</span>
<a name="l2279"><span class="ln">2279 </span></a><span class="s0">`Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a</span>
<a name="l2280"><span class="ln">2280 </span></a><span class="s0">good match.'&quot;</span>
<a name="l2281"><span class="ln">2281 </span></a>
<a name="l2282"><span class="ln">2282 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say</span>
<a name="l2283"><span class="ln">2283 </span></a><span class="s0">any such thing.  What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all</span>
<a name="l2284"><span class="ln">2284 </span></a><span class="s0">his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate</span>
<a name="l2285"><span class="ln">2285 </span></a><span class="s0">friend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying</span>
<a name="l2286"><span class="ln">2286 </span></a><span class="s0">a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I</span>
<a name="l2287"><span class="ln">2287 </span></a><span class="s0">wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings.</span>
<a name="l2288"><span class="ln">2288 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you mine are very different.  I must think your statement</span>
<a name="l2289"><span class="ln">2289 </span></a><span class="s0">by no means fair.  You are not just to Harriet's claims.</span>
<a name="l2290"><span class="ln">2290 </span></a><span class="s0">They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself;</span>
<a name="l2291"><span class="ln">2291 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly</span>
<a name="l2292"><span class="ln">2292 </span></a><span class="s0">her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves</span>
<a name="l2293"><span class="ln">2293 </span></a><span class="s0">is much above his.--It would be a degradation.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2294"><span class="ln">2294 </span></a>
<a name="l2295"><span class="ln">2295 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married</span>
<a name="l2296"><span class="ln">2296 </span></a><span class="s0">to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!&quot;</span>
<a name="l2297"><span class="ln">2297 </span></a>
<a name="l2298"><span class="ln">2298 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense</span>
<a name="l2299"><span class="ln">2299 </span></a><span class="s0">she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense.</span>
<a name="l2300"><span class="ln">2300 </span></a><span class="s0">She is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below</span>
<a name="l2301"><span class="ln">2301 </span></a><span class="s0">the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely</span>
<a name="l2302"><span class="ln">2302 </span></a><span class="s0">be a doubt that her father is a gentleman--and a gentleman of</span>
<a name="l2303"><span class="ln">2303 </span></a><span class="s0">fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged</span>
<a name="l2304"><span class="ln">2304 </span></a><span class="s0">for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter,</span>
<a name="l2305"><span class="ln">2305 </span></a><span class="s0">is indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen's daughters,</span>
<a name="l2306"><span class="ln">2306 </span></a><span class="s0">no one, I apprehend, will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2307"><span class="ln">2307 </span></a>
<a name="l2308"><span class="ln">2308 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Whoever might be her parents,&quot; said Mr. Knightley, &quot;whoever may</span>
<a name="l2309"><span class="ln">2309 </span></a><span class="s0">have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part</span>
<a name="l2310"><span class="ln">2310 </span></a><span class="s0">of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.</span>
<a name="l2311"><span class="ln">2311 </span></a><span class="s0">After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in</span>
<a name="l2312"><span class="ln">2312 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short,</span>
<a name="l2313"><span class="ln">2313 </span></a><span class="s0">in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance.</span>
<a name="l2314"><span class="ln">2314 </span></a><span class="s0">Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_</span>
<a name="l2315"><span class="ln">2315 </span></a><span class="s0">good enough.  She desired nothing better herself.  Till you chose</span>
<a name="l2316"><span class="ln">2316 </span></a><span class="s0">to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set,</span>
<a name="l2317"><span class="ln">2317 </span></a><span class="s0">nor any ambition beyond it.  She was as happy as possible with the</span>
<a name="l2318"><span class="ln">2318 </span></a><span class="s0">Martins in the summer.  She had no sense of superiority then.</span>
<a name="l2319"><span class="ln">2319 </span></a><span class="s0">If she has it now, you have given it.  You have been no friend to</span>
<a name="l2320"><span class="ln">2320 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet Smith, Emma.  Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far,</span>
<a name="l2321"><span class="ln">2321 </span></a><span class="s0">if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him.</span>
<a name="l2322"><span class="ln">2322 </span></a><span class="s0">I know him well.  He has too much real feeling to address any</span>
<a name="l2323"><span class="ln">2323 </span></a><span class="s0">woman on the haphazard of selfish passion.  And as to conceit,</span>
<a name="l2324"><span class="ln">2324 </span></a><span class="s0">he is the farthest from it of any man I know.  Depend upon it he</span>
<a name="l2325"><span class="ln">2325 </span></a><span class="s0">had encouragement.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2326"><span class="ln">2326 </span></a>
<a name="l2327"><span class="ln">2327 </span></a><span class="s0">It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this</span>
<a name="l2328"><span class="ln">2328 </span></a><span class="s0">assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.</span>
<a name="l2329"><span class="ln">2329 </span></a>
<a name="l2330"><span class="ln">2330 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,</span>
<a name="l2331"><span class="ln">2331 </span></a><span class="s0">are unjust to Harriet.  Harriet's claims to marry well are not</span>
<a name="l2332"><span class="ln">2332 </span></a><span class="s0">so contemptible as you represent them.  She is not a clever girl,</span>
<a name="l2333"><span class="ln">2333 </span></a><span class="s0">but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not</span>
<a name="l2334"><span class="ln">2334 </span></a><span class="s0">deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly.</span>
<a name="l2335"><span class="ln">2335 </span></a><span class="s0">Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you</span>
<a name="l2336"><span class="ln">2336 </span></a><span class="s0">describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in</span>
<a name="l2337"><span class="ln">2337 </span></a><span class="s0">the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations</span>
<a name="l2338"><span class="ln">2338 </span></a><span class="s0">to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl,</span>
<a name="l2339"><span class="ln">2339 </span></a><span class="s0">and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred;</span>
<a name="l2340"><span class="ln">2340 </span></a><span class="s0">and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject</span>
<a name="l2341"><span class="ln">2341 </span></a><span class="s0">of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall</span>
<a name="l2342"><span class="ln">2342 </span></a><span class="s0">in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl,</span>
<a name="l2343"><span class="ln">2343 </span></a><span class="s0">with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired</span>
<a name="l2344"><span class="ln">2344 </span></a><span class="s0">and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many,</span>
<a name="l2345"><span class="ln">2345 </span></a><span class="s0">consequently a claim to be nice.  Her good-nature, too, is not so very</span>
<a name="l2346"><span class="ln">2346 </span></a><span class="s0">slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness</span>
<a name="l2347"><span class="ln">2347 </span></a><span class="s0">of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great</span>
<a name="l2348"><span class="ln">2348 </span></a><span class="s0">readiness to be pleased with other people.  I am very much mistaken</span>
<a name="l2349"><span class="ln">2349 </span></a><span class="s0">if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper,</span>
<a name="l2350"><span class="ln">2350 </span></a><span class="s0">the highest claims a woman could possess.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2351"><span class="ln">2351 </span></a>
<a name="l2352"><span class="ln">2352 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have,</span>
<a name="l2353"><span class="ln">2353 </span></a><span class="s0">is almost enough to make me think so too.  Better be without sense,</span>
<a name="l2354"><span class="ln">2354 </span></a><span class="s0">than misapply it as you do.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2355"><span class="ln">2355 </span></a>
<a name="l2356"><span class="ln">2356 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To be sure!&quot; cried she playfully.  &quot;I know _that_ is the feeling</span>
<a name="l2357"><span class="ln">2357 </span></a><span class="s0">of you all.  I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly</span>
<a name="l2358"><span class="ln">2358 </span></a><span class="s0">what every man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses</span>
<a name="l2359"><span class="ln">2359 </span></a><span class="s0">and satisfies his judgment.  Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse.</span>
<a name="l2360"><span class="ln">2360 </span></a><span class="s0">Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you.</span>
<a name="l2361"><span class="ln">2361 </span></a><span class="s0">And is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning</span>
<a name="l2362"><span class="ln">2362 </span></a><span class="s0">to be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first</span>
<a name="l2363"><span class="ln">2363 </span></a><span class="s0">offer she receives? No--pray let her have time to look about her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2364"><span class="ln">2364 </span></a>
<a name="l2365"><span class="ln">2365 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,&quot; said Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l2366"><span class="ln">2366 </span></a><span class="s0">presently, &quot;though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now</span>
<a name="l2367"><span class="ln">2367 </span></a><span class="s0">perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.</span>
<a name="l2368"><span class="ln">2368 </span></a><span class="s0">You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what</span>
<a name="l2369"><span class="ln">2369 </span></a><span class="s0">she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her</span>
<a name="l2370"><span class="ln">2370 </span></a><span class="s0">reach will be good enough for her.  Vanity working on a weak head,</span>
<a name="l2371"><span class="ln">2371 </span></a><span class="s0">produces every sort of mischief.  Nothing so easy as for a young lady</span>
<a name="l2372"><span class="ln">2372 </span></a><span class="s0">to raise her expectations too high.  Miss Harriet Smith may not find</span>
<a name="l2373"><span class="ln">2373 </span></a><span class="s0">offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl.</span>
<a name="l2374"><span class="ln">2374 </span></a><span class="s0">Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives.</span>
<a name="l2375"><span class="ln">2375 </span></a><span class="s0">Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves</span>
<a name="l2376"><span class="ln">2376 </span></a><span class="s0">with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent men would be</span>
<a name="l2377"><span class="ln">2377 </span></a><span class="s0">afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in,</span>
<a name="l2378"><span class="ln">2378 </span></a><span class="s0">when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed.  Let her marry</span>
<a name="l2379"><span class="ln">2379 </span></a><span class="s0">Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever;</span>
<a name="l2380"><span class="ln">2380 </span></a><span class="s0">but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach</span>
<a name="l2381"><span class="ln">2381 </span></a><span class="s0">her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence</span>
<a name="l2382"><span class="ln">2382 </span></a><span class="s0">and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's</span>
<a name="l2383"><span class="ln">2383 </span></a><span class="s0">all the rest of her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a</span>
<a name="l2384"><span class="ln">2384 </span></a><span class="s0">girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate,</span>
<a name="l2385"><span class="ln">2385 </span></a><span class="s0">and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2386"><span class="ln">2386 </span></a>
<a name="l2387"><span class="ln">2387 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l2388"><span class="ln">2388 </span></a><span class="s0">that there can be no use in canvassing it.  We shall only be making</span>
<a name="l2389"><span class="ln">2389 </span></a><span class="s0">each other more angry.  But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin,</span>
<a name="l2390"><span class="ln">2390 </span></a><span class="s0">it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think,</span>
<a name="l2391"><span class="ln">2391 </span></a><span class="s0">as must prevent any second application.  She must abide by the evil</span>
<a name="l2392"><span class="ln">2392 </span></a><span class="s0">of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself,</span>
<a name="l2393"><span class="ln">2393 </span></a><span class="s0">I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little;</span>
<a name="l2394"><span class="ln">2394 </span></a><span class="s0">but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.</span>
<a name="l2395"><span class="ln">2395 </span></a><span class="s0">His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad,</span>
<a name="l2396"><span class="ln">2396 </span></a><span class="s0">that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now.</span>
<a name="l2397"><span class="ln">2397 </span></a><span class="s0">I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior,</span>
<a name="l2398"><span class="ln">2398 </span></a><span class="s0">she might tolerate him.  He was the brother of her friends,</span>
<a name="l2399"><span class="ln">2399 </span></a><span class="s0">and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen</span>
<a name="l2400"><span class="ln">2400 </span></a><span class="s0">nobody better (that must have been his great assistant)</span>
<a name="l2401"><span class="ln">2401 </span></a><span class="s0">she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable.</span>
<a name="l2402"><span class="ln">2402 </span></a><span class="s0">But the case is altered now.  She knows now what gentlemen are;</span>
<a name="l2403"><span class="ln">2403 </span></a><span class="s0">and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance</span>
<a name="l2404"><span class="ln">2404 </span></a><span class="s0">with Harriet.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2405"><span class="ln">2405 </span></a>
<a name="l2406"><span class="ln">2406 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!&quot; cried Mr. Knightley.--&quot;Robert</span>
<a name="l2407"><span class="ln">2407 </span></a><span class="s0">Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend</span>
<a name="l2408"><span class="ln">2408 </span></a><span class="s0">them; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2409"><span class="ln">2409 </span></a>
<a name="l2410"><span class="ln">2410 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was</span>
<a name="l2411"><span class="ln">2411 </span></a><span class="s0">really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.</span>
<a name="l2412"><span class="ln">2412 </span></a><span class="s0">She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself</span>
<a name="l2413"><span class="ln">2413 </span></a><span class="s0">a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he</span>
<a name="l2414"><span class="ln">2414 </span></a><span class="s0">could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment</span>
<a name="l2415"><span class="ln">2415 </span></a><span class="s0">in general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her;</span>
<a name="l2416"><span class="ln">2416 </span></a><span class="s0">and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state,</span>
<a name="l2417"><span class="ln">2417 </span></a><span class="s0">was very disagreeable.  Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence,</span>
<a name="l2418"><span class="ln">2418 </span></a><span class="s0">with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather,</span>
<a name="l2419"><span class="ln">2419 </span></a><span class="s0">but he made no answer.  He was thinking.  The result of his thoughts</span>
<a name="l2420"><span class="ln">2420 </span></a><span class="s0">appeared at last in these words.</span>
<a name="l2421"><span class="ln">2421 </span></a>
<a name="l2422"><span class="ln">2422 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I</span>
<a name="l2423"><span class="ln">2423 </span></a><span class="s0">hope it will not be long before he does.  Your views for Harriet</span>
<a name="l2424"><span class="ln">2424 </span></a><span class="s0">are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love</span>
<a name="l2425"><span class="ln">2425 </span></a><span class="s0">of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans,</span>
<a name="l2426"><span class="ln">2426 </span></a><span class="s0">and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you</span>
<a name="l2427"><span class="ln">2427 </span></a><span class="s0">that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2428"><span class="ln">2428 </span></a>
<a name="l2429"><span class="ln">2429 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma laughed and disclaimed.  He continued,</span>
<a name="l2430"><span class="ln">2430 </span></a>
<a name="l2431"><span class="ln">2431 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Depend upon it, Elton will not do.  Elton is a very good sort of man,</span>
<a name="l2432"><span class="ln">2432 </span></a><span class="s0">and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely</span>
<a name="l2433"><span class="ln">2433 </span></a><span class="s0">to make an imprudent match.  He knows the value of a good income</span>
<a name="l2434"><span class="ln">2434 </span></a><span class="s0">as well as any body.  Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will</span>
<a name="l2435"><span class="ln">2435 </span></a><span class="s0">act rationally.  He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you</span>
<a name="l2436"><span class="ln">2436 </span></a><span class="s0">can be with Harriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome young man,</span>
<a name="l2437"><span class="ln">2437 </span></a><span class="s0">and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way</span>
<a name="l2438"><span class="ln">2438 </span></a><span class="s0">of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present,</span>
<a name="l2439"><span class="ln">2439 </span></a><span class="s0">I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away.</span>
<a name="l2440"><span class="ln">2440 </span></a><span class="s0">I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family</span>
<a name="l2441"><span class="ln">2441 </span></a><span class="s0">of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all</span>
<a name="l2442"><span class="ln">2442 </span></a><span class="s0">twenty thousand pounds apiece.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2443"><span class="ln">2443 </span></a>
<a name="l2444"><span class="ln">2444 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am very much obliged to you,&quot; said Emma, laughing again.</span>
<a name="l2445"><span class="ln">2445 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would</span>
<a name="l2446"><span class="ln">2446 </span></a><span class="s0">have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want</span>
<a name="l2447"><span class="ln">2447 </span></a><span class="s0">to keep Harriet to myself.  I have done with match-making indeed.</span>
<a name="l2448"><span class="ln">2448 </span></a><span class="s0">I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls.  I shall leave</span>
<a name="l2449"><span class="ln">2449 </span></a><span class="s0">off while I am well.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2450"><span class="ln">2450 </span></a>
<a name="l2451"><span class="ln">2451 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Good morning to you,&quot;--said he, rising and walking off abruptly.</span>
<a name="l2452"><span class="ln">2452 </span></a><span class="s0">He was very much vexed.  He felt the disappointment of the young man,</span>
<a name="l2453"><span class="ln">2453 </span></a><span class="s0">and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the</span>
<a name="l2454"><span class="ln">2454 </span></a><span class="s0">sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had</span>
<a name="l2455"><span class="ln">2455 </span></a><span class="s0">taken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly.</span>
<a name="l2456"><span class="ln">2456 </span></a>
<a name="l2457"><span class="ln">2457 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more</span>
<a name="l2458"><span class="ln">2458 </span></a><span class="s0">indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his.  She did not always</span>
<a name="l2459"><span class="ln">2459 </span></a><span class="s0">feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that</span>
<a name="l2460"><span class="ln">2460 </span></a><span class="s0">her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l2461"><span class="ln">2461 </span></a><span class="s0">He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her.</span>
<a name="l2462"><span class="ln">2462 </span></a><span class="s0">She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little</span>
<a name="l2463"><span class="ln">2463 </span></a><span class="s0">time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives.</span>
<a name="l2464"><span class="ln">2464 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy.</span>
<a name="l2465"><span class="ln">2465 </span></a><span class="s0">The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's</span>
<a name="l2466"><span class="ln">2466 </span></a><span class="s0">that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause,</span>
<a name="l2467"><span class="ln">2467 </span></a><span class="s0">gave alarming ideas.  The dread of such a failure after all became the</span>
<a name="l2468"><span class="ln">2468 </span></a><span class="s0">prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits,</span>
<a name="l2469"><span class="ln">2469 </span></a><span class="s0">and without having any such reason to give for her long absence,</span>
<a name="l2470"><span class="ln">2470 </span></a><span class="s0">she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind,</span>
<a name="l2471"><span class="ln">2471 </span></a><span class="s0">and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would,</span>
<a name="l2472"><span class="ln">2472 </span></a><span class="s0">she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings</span>
<a name="l2473"><span class="ln">2473 </span></a><span class="s0">would not justify.</span>
<a name="l2474"><span class="ln">2474 </span></a>
<a name="l2475"><span class="ln">2475 </span></a><span class="s0">He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered</span>
<a name="l2476"><span class="ln">2476 </span></a><span class="s0">that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done,</span>
<a name="l2477"><span class="ln">2477 </span></a><span class="s0">neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself,</span>
<a name="l2478"><span class="ln">2478 </span></a><span class="s0">in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such</span>
<a name="l2479"><span class="ln">2479 </span></a><span class="s0">an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it</span>
<a name="l2480"><span class="ln">2480 </span></a><span class="s0">hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather</span>
<a name="l2481"><span class="ln">2481 </span></a><span class="s0">said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew</span>
<a name="l2482"><span class="ln">2482 </span></a><span class="s0">any thing about.  He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak</span>
<a name="l2483"><span class="ln">2483 </span></a><span class="s0">with more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not</span>
<a name="l2484"><span class="ln">2484 </span></a><span class="s0">be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters;</span>
<a name="l2485"><span class="ln">2485 </span></a><span class="s0">he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;</span>
<a name="l2486"><span class="ln">2486 </span></a><span class="s0">but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence</span>
<a name="l2487"><span class="ln">2487 </span></a><span class="s0">of a strong passion at war with all interested motives.  Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l2488"><span class="ln">2488 </span></a><span class="s0">saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects;</span>
<a name="l2489"><span class="ln">2489 </span></a><span class="s0">but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any</span>
<a name="l2490"><span class="ln">2490 </span></a><span class="s0">hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest;</span>
<a name="l2491"><span class="ln">2491 </span></a><span class="s0">and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very</span>
<a name="l2492"><span class="ln">2492 </span></a><span class="s0">sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.</span>
<a name="l2493"><span class="ln">2493 </span></a>
<a name="l2494"><span class="ln">2494 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,</span>
<a name="l2495"><span class="ln">2495 </span></a><span class="s0">not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.  Miss Nash</span>
<a name="l2496"><span class="ln">2496 </span></a><span class="s0">had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately</span>
<a name="l2497"><span class="ln">2497 </span></a><span class="s0">with great delight.  Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend</span>
<a name="l2498"><span class="ln">2498 </span></a><span class="s0">a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash,</span>
<a name="l2499"><span class="ln">2499 </span></a><span class="s0">that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met</span>
<a name="l2500"><span class="ln">2500 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton, and found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was</span>
<a name="l2501"><span class="ln">2501 </span></a><span class="s0">actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till</span>
<a name="l2502"><span class="ln">2502 </span></a><span class="s0">the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been</span>
<a name="l2503"><span class="ln">2503 </span></a><span class="s0">never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him</span>
<a name="l2504"><span class="ln">2504 </span></a><span class="s0">about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player,</span>
<a name="l2505"><span class="ln">2505 </span></a><span class="s0">to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off</span>
<a name="l2506"><span class="ln">2506 </span></a><span class="s0">his journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been</span>
<a name="l2507"><span class="ln">2507 </span></a><span class="s0">determined to go on, and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed,</span>
<a name="l2508"><span class="ln">2508 </span></a><span class="s0">that he was going on business which he would not put off for any</span>
<a name="l2509"><span class="ln">2509 </span></a><span class="s0">inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission,</span>
<a name="l2510"><span class="ln">2510 </span></a><span class="s0">and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.  Mr. Perry</span>
<a name="l2511"><span class="ln">2511 </span></a><span class="s0">could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must</span>
<a name="l2512"><span class="ln">2512 </span></a><span class="s0">be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only</span>
<a name="l2513"><span class="ln">2513 </span></a><span class="s0">looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.</span>
<a name="l2514"><span class="ln">2514 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more</span>
<a name="l2515"><span class="ln">2515 </span></a><span class="s0">about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,</span>
<a name="l2516"><span class="ln">2516 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be,</span>
<a name="l2517"><span class="ln">2517 </span></a><span class="s0">but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer,</span>
<a name="l2518"><span class="ln">2518 </span></a><span class="s0">she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt,</span>
<a name="l2519"><span class="ln">2519 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.&quot;</span>

<a name="l2526"><span class="ln">2526 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel</span>
<a name="l2527"><span class="ln">2527 </span></a><span class="s0">with herself.  He was so much displeased, that it was longer than</span>
<a name="l2528"><span class="ln">2528 </span></a><span class="s0">usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet,</span>
<a name="l2529"><span class="ln">2529 </span></a><span class="s0">his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven.  She was sorry,</span>
<a name="l2530"><span class="ln">2530 </span></a><span class="s0">but could not repent.  On the contrary, her plans and proceedings</span>
<a name="l2531"><span class="ln">2531 </span></a><span class="s0">were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general</span>
<a name="l2532"><span class="ln">2532 </span></a><span class="s0">appearances of the next few days.</span>
<a name="l2533"><span class="ln">2533 </span></a>
<a name="l2534"><span class="ln">2534 </span></a><span class="s0">The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after</span>
<a name="l2535"><span class="ln">2535 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common</span>
<a name="l2536"><span class="ln">2536 </span></a><span class="s0">sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences</span>
<a name="l2537"><span class="ln">2537 </span></a><span class="s0">of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were</span>
<a name="l2538"><span class="ln">2538 </span></a><span class="s0">visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment</span>
<a name="l2539"><span class="ln">2539 </span></a><span class="s0">as her youth and sort of mind admitted.  Emma was soon perfectly</span>
<a name="l2540"><span class="ln">2540 </span></a><span class="s0">satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as</span>
<a name="l2541"><span class="ln">2541 </span></a><span class="s0">he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.</span>
<a name="l2542"><span class="ln">2542 </span></a>
<a name="l2543"><span class="ln">2543 </span></a><span class="s0">Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal</span>
<a name="l2544"><span class="ln">2544 </span></a><span class="s0">of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than</span>
<a name="l2545"><span class="ln">2545 </span></a><span class="s0">a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow.</span>
<a name="l2546"><span class="ln">2546 </span></a><span class="s0">It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let</span>
<a name="l2547"><span class="ln">2547 </span></a><span class="s0">her imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be</span>
<a name="l2548"><span class="ln">2548 </span></a><span class="s0">labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts;</span>
<a name="l2549"><span class="ln">2549 </span></a><span class="s0">and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present,</span>
<a name="l2550"><span class="ln">2550 </span></a><span class="s0">the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life,</span>
<a name="l2551"><span class="ln">2551 </span></a><span class="s0">was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort</span>
<a name="l2552"><span class="ln">2552 </span></a><span class="s0">that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper,</span>
<a name="l2553"><span class="ln">2553 </span></a><span class="s0">made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.</span>
<a name="l2554"><span class="ln">2554 </span></a>
<a name="l2555"><span class="ln">2555 </span></a><span class="s0">In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale</span>
<a name="l2556"><span class="ln">2556 </span></a><span class="s0">are not uncommon.  Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's,</span>
<a name="l2557"><span class="ln">2557 </span></a><span class="s0">had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken</span>
<a name="l2558"><span class="ln">2558 </span></a><span class="s0">the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help,</span>
<a name="l2559"><span class="ln">2559 </span></a><span class="s0">to get a great many more.  Emma assisted with her invention,</span>
<a name="l2560"><span class="ln">2560 </span></a><span class="s0">memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand,</span>
<a name="l2561"><span class="ln">2561 </span></a><span class="s0">it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form</span>
<a name="l2562"><span class="ln">2562 </span></a><span class="s0">as well as quantity.</span>
<a name="l2563"><span class="ln">2563 </span></a>
<a name="l2564"><span class="ln">2564 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls,</span>
<a name="l2565"><span class="ln">2565 </span></a><span class="s0">and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in.</span>
<a name="l2566"><span class="ln">2566 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he</span>
<a name="l2567"><span class="ln">2567 </span></a><span class="s0">wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2568"><span class="ln">2568 </span></a><span class="s0">And it always ended in &quot;Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2569"><span class="ln">2569 </span></a>
<a name="l2570"><span class="ln">2570 </span></a><span class="s0">His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,</span>
<a name="l2571"><span class="ln">2571 </span></a><span class="s0">did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind;</span>
<a name="l2572"><span class="ln">2572 </span></a><span class="s0">but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about</span>
<a name="l2573"><span class="ln">2573 </span></a><span class="s0">so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter.</span>
<a name="l2574"><span class="ln">2574 </span></a>
<a name="l2575"><span class="ln">2575 </span></a><span class="s0">It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of</span>
<a name="l2576"><span class="ln">2576 </span></a><span class="s0">Highbury in general should be put under requisition.  Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l2577"><span class="ln">2577 </span></a><span class="s0">was the only one whose assistance she asked.  He was invited</span>
<a name="l2578"><span class="ln">2578 </span></a><span class="s0">to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums</span>
<a name="l2579"><span class="ln">2579 </span></a><span class="s0">that he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him</span>
<a name="l2580"><span class="ln">2580 </span></a><span class="s0">most intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time,</span>
<a name="l2581"><span class="ln">2581 </span></a><span class="s0">as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant,</span>
<a name="l2582"><span class="ln">2582 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass</span>
<a name="l2583"><span class="ln">2583 </span></a><span class="s0">his lips.  They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles;</span>
<a name="l2584"><span class="ln">2584 </span></a><span class="s0">and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled,</span>
<a name="l2585"><span class="ln">2585 </span></a><span class="s0">and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,</span>
<a name="l2586"><span class="ln">2586 </span></a>
<a name="l2587"><span class="ln">2587 </span></a>    <span class="s0">My first doth affliction denote,</span>
<a name="l2588"><span class="ln">2588 </span></a>      <span class="s0">Which my second is destin'd to feel</span>
<a name="l2589"><span class="ln">2589 </span></a>    <span class="s0">And my whole is the best antidote</span>
<a name="l2590"><span class="ln">2590 </span></a>      <span class="s0">That affliction to soften and heal.--</span>
<a name="l2591"><span class="ln">2591 </span></a>
<a name="l2592"><span class="ln">2592 </span></a><span class="s0">made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it</span>
<a name="l2593"><span class="ln">2593 </span></a><span class="s0">some pages ago already.</span>
<a name="l2594"><span class="ln">2594 </span></a>
<a name="l2595"><span class="ln">2595 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?&quot; said she;</span>
<a name="l2596"><span class="ln">2596 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be</span>
<a name="l2597"><span class="ln">2597 </span></a><span class="s0">easier to you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2598"><span class="ln">2598 </span></a>
<a name="l2599"><span class="ln">2599 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind</span>
<a name="l2600"><span class="ln">2600 </span></a><span class="s0">in his life.  The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss</span>
<a name="l2601"><span class="ln">2601 </span></a><span class="s0">Woodhouse&quot;--he stopt a moment--&quot;or Miss Smith could inspire him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2602"><span class="ln">2602 </span></a>
<a name="l2603"><span class="ln">2603 </span></a><span class="s0">The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration.</span>
<a name="l2604"><span class="ln">2604 </span></a><span class="s0">He called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the</span>
<a name="l2605"><span class="ln">2605 </span></a><span class="s0">table containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had</span>
<a name="l2606"><span class="ln">2606 </span></a><span class="s0">addressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which,</span>
<a name="l2607"><span class="ln">2607 </span></a><span class="s0">from his manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.</span>
<a name="l2608"><span class="ln">2608 </span></a>
<a name="l2609"><span class="ln">2609 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection,&quot; said he.</span>
<a name="l2610"><span class="ln">2610 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Being my friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree</span>
<a name="l2611"><span class="ln">2611 </span></a><span class="s0">to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2612"><span class="ln">2612 </span></a>
<a name="l2613"><span class="ln">2613 </span></a><span class="s0">The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma</span>
<a name="l2614"><span class="ln">2614 </span></a><span class="s0">could understand.  There was deep consciousness about him,</span>
<a name="l2615"><span class="ln">2615 </span></a><span class="s0">and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's.</span>
<a name="l2616"><span class="ln">2616 </span></a><span class="s0">He was gone the next moment:--after another moment's pause,</span>
<a name="l2617"><span class="ln">2617 </span></a>
<a name="l2618"><span class="ln">2618 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Take it,&quot; said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards</span>
<a name="l2619"><span class="ln">2619 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet--&quot;it is for you.  Take your own.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2620"><span class="ln">2620 </span></a>
<a name="l2621"><span class="ln">2621 </span></a><span class="s0">But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma,</span>
<a name="l2622"><span class="ln">2622 </span></a><span class="s0">never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.</span>
<a name="l2623"><span class="ln">2623 </span></a>

<a name="l2641"><span class="ln">2641 </span></a><span class="s0">She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through</span>

<a name="l2643"><span class="ln">2643 </span></a><span class="s0">passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,</span>
<a name="l2644"><span class="ln">2644 </span></a><span class="s0">while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion</span>
<a name="l2645"><span class="ln">2645 </span></a><span class="s0">of hope and dulness, &quot;Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed.</span>

<a name="l2659"><span class="ln">2659 </span></a><span class="s0">in love, indeed, to describe her so.  Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish</span>

<a name="l2707"><span class="ln">2707 </span></a><span class="s0">which I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty</span>
<a name="l2708"><span class="ln">2708 </span></a><span class="s0">in comprehending.  Read it in comfort to yourself.  There can</span>
<a name="l2709"><span class="ln">2709 </span></a><span class="s0">be no doubt of its being written for you and to you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2710"><span class="ln">2710 </span></a>
<a name="l2711"><span class="ln">2711 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion.</span>
<a name="l2712"><span class="ln">2712 </span></a><span class="s0">She read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness.</span>
<a name="l2713"><span class="ln">2713 </span></a><span class="s0">She could not speak.  But she was not wanted to speak.  It was enough</span>
<a name="l2714"><span class="ln">2714 </span></a><span class="s0">for her to feel.  Emma spoke for her.</span>
<a name="l2715"><span class="ln">2715 </span></a>
<a name="l2716"><span class="ln">2716 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,&quot;</span>
<a name="l2717"><span class="ln">2717 </span></a><span class="s0">said she, &quot;that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions.</span>
<a name="l2718"><span class="ln">2718 </span></a><span class="s0">You are his object--and you will soon receive the completest proof</span>
<a name="l2719"><span class="ln">2719 </span></a><span class="s0">of it.  I thought it must be so.  I thought I could not be so deceived;</span>
<a name="l2720"><span class="ln">2720 </span></a><span class="s0">but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided,</span>
<a name="l2721"><span class="ln">2721 </span></a><span class="s0">as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you.</span>
<a name="l2722"><span class="ln">2722 </span></a><span class="s0">Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance</span>
<a name="l2723"><span class="ln">2723 </span></a><span class="s0">to happen what has happened.  I could never tell whether an attachment</span>
<a name="l2724"><span class="ln">2724 </span></a><span class="s0">between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural.</span>
<a name="l2725"><span class="ln">2725 </span></a><span class="s0">Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each</span>
<a name="l2726"><span class="ln">2726 </span></a><span class="s0">other! I am very happy.  I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all</span>
<a name="l2727"><span class="ln">2727 </span></a><span class="s0">my heart.  This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride</span>
<a name="l2728"><span class="ln">2728 </span></a><span class="s0">in creating.  This is a connexion which offers nothing but good.</span>
<a name="l2729"><span class="ln">2729 </span></a><span class="s0">It will give you every thing that you want--consideration, independence,</span>
<a name="l2730"><span class="ln">2730 </span></a><span class="s0">a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends,</span>
<a name="l2731"><span class="ln">2731 </span></a><span class="s0">close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever.</span>
<a name="l2732"><span class="ln">2732 </span></a><span class="s0">This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either</span>
<a name="l2733"><span class="ln">2733 </span></a><span class="s0">of us.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2734"><span class="ln">2734 </span></a>
<a name="l2735"><span class="ln">2735 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Dear Miss Woodhouse!&quot;--and &quot;Dear Miss Woodhouse,&quot; was all that Harriet,</span>
<a name="l2736"><span class="ln">2736 </span></a><span class="s0">with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they</span>
<a name="l2737"><span class="ln">2737 </span></a><span class="s0">did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently</span>
<a name="l2738"><span class="ln">2738 </span></a><span class="s0">clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered</span>
<a name="l2739"><span class="ln">2739 </span></a><span class="s0">just as she ought.  Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.</span>
<a name="l2740"><span class="ln">2740 </span></a>
<a name="l2741"><span class="ln">2741 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Whatever you say is always right,&quot; cried Harriet, &quot;and therefore</span>
<a name="l2742"><span class="ln">2742 </span></a><span class="s0">I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could</span>
<a name="l2743"><span class="ln">2743 </span></a><span class="s0">not have imagined it.  It is so much beyond any thing I deserve.</span>
<a name="l2744"><span class="ln">2744 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions</span>
<a name="l2745"><span class="ln">2745 </span></a><span class="s0">about _him_.  He is so very superior.  Only think of those sweet</span>
<a name="l2746"><span class="ln">2746 </span></a><span class="s0">verses--`To Miss --------.' Dear me, how clever!--Could it really</span>
<a name="l2747"><span class="ln">2747 </span></a><span class="s0">be meant for me?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2748"><span class="ln">2748 </span></a>
<a name="l2749"><span class="ln">2749 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that.</span>
<a name="l2750"><span class="ln">2750 </span></a><span class="s0">It is a certainty.  Receive it on my judgment.  It is a sort</span>
<a name="l2751"><span class="ln">2751 </span></a><span class="s0">of prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon</span>
<a name="l2752"><span class="ln">2752 </span></a><span class="s0">followed by matter-of-fact prose.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2753"><span class="ln">2753 </span></a>
<a name="l2754"><span class="ln">2754 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected.  I am sure,</span>
<a name="l2755"><span class="ln">2755 </span></a><span class="s0">a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do</span>
<a name="l2756"><span class="ln">2756 </span></a><span class="s0">take place!&quot;</span>
<a name="l2757"><span class="ln">2757 </span></a>
<a name="l2758"><span class="ln">2758 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and</span>
<a name="l2759"><span class="ln">2759 </span></a><span class="s0">really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is</span>
<a name="l2760"><span class="ln">2760 </span></a><span class="s0">so evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement</span>
<a name="l2761"><span class="ln">2761 </span></a><span class="s0">of other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.</span>
<a name="l2762"><span class="ln">2762 </span></a><span class="s0">You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong</span>
<a name="l2763"><span class="ln">2763 </span></a><span class="s0">to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes.</span>
<a name="l2764"><span class="ln">2764 </span></a><span class="s0">Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls.  There does</span>
<a name="l2765"><span class="ln">2765 </span></a><span class="s0">seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love</span>
<a name="l2766"><span class="ln">2766 </span></a><span class="s0">exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel</span>
<a name="l2767"><span class="ln">2767 </span></a><span class="s0">where it ought to flow.</span>
<a name="l2768"><span class="ln">2768 </span></a>
<a name="l2769"><span class="ln">2769 </span></a>      <span class="s0">The course of true love never did run smooth--</span>
<a name="l2770"><span class="ln">2770 </span></a>
<a name="l2771"><span class="ln">2771 </span></a><span class="s0">A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2772"><span class="ln">2772 </span></a>
<a name="l2773"><span class="ln">2773 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,</span>
<a name="l2774"><span class="ln">2774 </span></a><span class="s0">who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,</span>
<a name="l2775"><span class="ln">2775 </span></a><span class="s0">the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body</span>
<a name="l2776"><span class="ln">2776 </span></a><span class="s0">looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after,</span>
<a name="l2777"><span class="ln">2777 </span></a><span class="s0">that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he</span>
<a name="l2778"><span class="ln">2778 </span></a><span class="s0">does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days</span>
<a name="l2779"><span class="ln">2779 </span></a><span class="s0">in the week.  And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down</span>
<a name="l2780"><span class="ln">2780 </span></a><span class="s0">all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury.</span>
<a name="l2781"><span class="ln">2781 </span></a><span class="s0">Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little</span>
<a name="l2782"><span class="ln">2782 </span></a><span class="s0">did I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and</span>
<a name="l2783"><span class="ln">2783 </span></a><span class="s0">peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss</span>
<a name="l2784"><span class="ln">2784 </span></a><span class="s0">Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself;</span>
<a name="l2785"><span class="ln">2785 </span></a><span class="s0">however, she called me back presently, and let me look too,</span>
<a name="l2786"><span class="ln">2786 </span></a><span class="s0">which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he looked!</span>
<a name="l2787"><span class="ln">2787 </span></a><span class="s0">He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2788"><span class="ln">2788 </span></a>
<a name="l2789"><span class="ln">2789 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be,</span>
<a name="l2790"><span class="ln">2790 </span></a><span class="s0">must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense;</span>
<a name="l2791"><span class="ln">2791 </span></a><span class="s0">and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools.  If they</span>
<a name="l2792"><span class="ln">2792 </span></a><span class="s0">are anxious to see you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable</span>
<a name="l2793"><span class="ln">2793 </span></a><span class="s0">character gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you</span>
<a name="l2794"><span class="ln">2794 </span></a><span class="s0">settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen</span>
<a name="l2795"><span class="ln">2795 </span></a><span class="s0">to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only</span>
<a name="l2796"><span class="ln">2796 </span></a><span class="s0">object is that you should, in the common phrase, be _well_ married,</span>
<a name="l2797"><span class="ln">2797 </span></a><span class="s0">here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment,</span>
<a name="l2798"><span class="ln">2798 </span></a><span class="s0">the rise in the world which must satisfy them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2799"><span class="ln">2799 </span></a>
<a name="l2800"><span class="ln">2800 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, very true.  How nicely you talk; I love to hear you.</span>
<a name="l2801"><span class="ln">2801 </span></a><span class="s0">You understand every thing.  You and Mr. Elton are one as clever</span>
<a name="l2802"><span class="ln">2802 </span></a><span class="s0">as the other.  This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth,</span>
<a name="l2803"><span class="ln">2803 </span></a><span class="s0">I could never have made any thing like it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2804"><span class="ln">2804 </span></a>
<a name="l2805"><span class="ln">2805 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining</span>
<a name="l2806"><span class="ln">2806 </span></a><span class="s0">it yesterday.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2807"><span class="ln">2807 </span></a>
<a name="l2808"><span class="ln">2808 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2809"><span class="ln">2809 </span></a>
<a name="l2810"><span class="ln">2810 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2811"><span class="ln">2811 </span></a>
<a name="l2812"><span class="ln">2812 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is as long again as almost all we have had before.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2813"><span class="ln">2813 </span></a>
<a name="l2814"><span class="ln">2814 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour.</span>
<a name="l2815"><span class="ln">2815 </span></a><span class="s0">Such things in general cannot be too short.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2816"><span class="ln">2816 </span></a>
<a name="l2817"><span class="ln">2817 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear.  The most satisfactory</span>
<a name="l2818"><span class="ln">2818 </span></a><span class="s0">comparisons were rising in her mind.</span>
<a name="l2819"><span class="ln">2819 </span></a>
<a name="l2820"><span class="ln">2820 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is one thing,&quot; said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--&quot;to</span>
<a name="l2821"><span class="ln">2821 </span></a><span class="s0">have very good sense in a common way, like every body else,</span>
<a name="l2822"><span class="ln">2822 </span></a><span class="s0">and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter,</span>
<a name="l2823"><span class="ln">2823 </span></a><span class="s0">and say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write</span>
<a name="l2824"><span class="ln">2824 </span></a><span class="s0">verses and charades like this.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2825"><span class="ln">2825 </span></a>
<a name="l2826"><span class="ln">2826 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's prose.</span>
<a name="l2827"><span class="ln">2827 </span></a>
<a name="l2828"><span class="ln">2828 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Such sweet lines!&quot; continued Harriet--&quot;these two last!--But</span>
<a name="l2829"><span class="ln">2829 </span></a><span class="s0">how shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found</span>
<a name="l2830"><span class="ln">2830 </span></a><span class="s0">it out?--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2831"><span class="ln">2831 </span></a>
<a name="l2832"><span class="ln">2832 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Leave it to me.  You do nothing.  He will be here this evening,</span>
<a name="l2833"><span class="ln">2833 </span></a><span class="s0">I dare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense</span>
<a name="l2834"><span class="ln">2834 </span></a><span class="s0">or other will pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your</span>
<a name="l2835"><span class="ln">2835 </span></a><span class="s0">soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming.  Trust to me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2836"><span class="ln">2836 </span></a>
<a name="l2837"><span class="ln">2837 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful</span>
<a name="l2838"><span class="ln">2838 </span></a><span class="s0">charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2839"><span class="ln">2839 </span></a>
<a name="l2840"><span class="ln">2840 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you</span>
<a name="l2841"><span class="ln">2841 </span></a><span class="s0">should not write it into your book.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2842"><span class="ln">2842 </span></a>
<a name="l2843"><span class="ln">2843 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! but those two lines are&quot;--</span>
<a name="l2844"><span class="ln">2844 </span></a>
<a name="l2845"><span class="ln">2845 </span></a><span class="s0">--&quot;The best of all.  Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private</span>
<a name="l2846"><span class="ln">2846 </span></a><span class="s0">enjoyment keep them.  They are not at all the less written you know,</span>
<a name="l2847"><span class="ln">2847 </span></a><span class="s0">because you divide them.  The couplet does not cease to be, nor does</span>
<a name="l2848"><span class="ln">2848 </span></a><span class="s0">its meaning change.  But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases,</span>
<a name="l2849"><span class="ln">2849 </span></a><span class="s0">and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection.</span>
<a name="l2850"><span class="ln">2850 </span></a><span class="s0">Depend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted,</span>
<a name="l2851"><span class="ln">2851 </span></a><span class="s0">much better than his passion.  A poet in love must be encouraged in</span>
<a name="l2852"><span class="ln">2852 </span></a><span class="s0">both capacities, or neither.  Give me the book, I will write it down,</span>
<a name="l2853"><span class="ln">2853 </span></a><span class="s0">and then there can be no possible reflection on you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2854"><span class="ln">2854 </span></a>
<a name="l2855"><span class="ln">2855 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,</span>
<a name="l2856"><span class="ln">2856 </span></a><span class="s0">so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down</span>
<a name="l2857"><span class="ln">2857 </span></a><span class="s0">a declaration of love.  It seemed too precious an offering for any</span>
<a name="l2858"><span class="ln">2858 </span></a><span class="s0">degree of publicity.</span>
<a name="l2859"><span class="ln">2859 </span></a>
<a name="l2860"><span class="ln">2860 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,&quot; said she.</span>
<a name="l2861"><span class="ln">2861 </span></a>
<a name="l2862"><span class="ln">2862 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Emma; &quot;a most natural feeling; and the longer</span>
<a name="l2863"><span class="ln">2863 </span></a><span class="s0">it lasts, the better I shall be pleased.  But here is my father</span>
<a name="l2864"><span class="ln">2864 </span></a><span class="s0">coming: you will not object to my reading the charade to him.</span>
<a name="l2865"><span class="ln">2865 </span></a><span class="s0">It will be giving him so much pleasure! He loves any thing of</span>
<a name="l2866"><span class="ln">2866 </span></a><span class="s0">the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment.</span>
<a name="l2867"><span class="ln">2867 </span></a><span class="s0">He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You must</span>
<a name="l2868"><span class="ln">2868 </span></a><span class="s0">let me read it to him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2869"><span class="ln">2869 </span></a>
<a name="l2870"><span class="ln">2870 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet looked grave.</span>

<a name="l2872"><span class="ln">2872 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this</span>
<a name="l2873"><span class="ln">2873 </span></a><span class="s0">charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are</span>
<a name="l2874"><span class="ln">2874 </span></a><span class="s0">too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning,</span>
<a name="l2875"><span class="ln">2875 </span></a><span class="s0">or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it.</span>
<a name="l2876"><span class="ln">2876 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration.</span>
<a name="l2877"><span class="ln">2877 </span></a><span class="s0">If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not have left the paper</span>
<a name="l2878"><span class="ln">2878 </span></a><span class="s0">while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you.</span>
<a name="l2879"><span class="ln">2879 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not let us be too solemn on the business.  He has encouragement</span>
<a name="l2880"><span class="ln">2880 </span></a><span class="s0">enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2881"><span class="ln">2881 </span></a>
<a name="l2882"><span class="ln">2882 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it.  Do as you please.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2883"><span class="ln">2883 </span></a>
<a name="l2884"><span class="ln">2884 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again,</span>
<a name="l2885"><span class="ln">2885 </span></a><span class="s0">by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of &quot;Well, my dears,</span>
<a name="l2886"><span class="ln">2886 </span></a><span class="s0">how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2887"><span class="ln">2887 </span></a>
<a name="l2888"><span class="ln">2888 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh.</span>
<a name="l2889"><span class="ln">2889 </span></a><span class="s0">A piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt,</span>
<a name="l2890"><span class="ln">2890 </span></a><span class="s0">we suppose, by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we</span>
<a name="l2891"><span class="ln">2891 </span></a><span class="s0">have just copied it in.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2892"><span class="ln">2892 </span></a>
<a name="l2893"><span class="ln">2893 </span></a><span class="s0">She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read,</span>
<a name="l2894"><span class="ln">2894 </span></a><span class="s0">slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations</span>
<a name="l2895"><span class="ln">2895 </span></a><span class="s0">of every part as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and,</span>
<a name="l2896"><span class="ln">2896 </span></a><span class="s0">as she had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.</span>
<a name="l2897"><span class="ln">2897 </span></a>
<a name="l2898"><span class="ln">2898 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said.</span>
<a name="l2899"><span class="ln">2899 </span></a><span class="s0">Very true.  `Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade,</span>
<a name="l2900"><span class="ln">2900 </span></a><span class="s0">my dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody</span>
<a name="l2901"><span class="ln">2901 </span></a><span class="s0">could have written so prettily, but you, Emma.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2902"><span class="ln">2902 </span></a>
<a name="l2903"><span class="ln">2903 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking,</span>
<a name="l2904"><span class="ln">2904 </span></a><span class="s0">and a very tender sigh, he added,</span>
<a name="l2905"><span class="ln">2905 </span></a>
<a name="l2906"><span class="ln">2906 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother</span>
<a name="l2907"><span class="ln">2907 </span></a><span class="s0">was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I</span>
<a name="l2908"><span class="ln">2908 </span></a><span class="s0">can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you</span>
<a name="l2909"><span class="ln">2909 </span></a><span class="s0">have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza;</span>
<a name="l2910"><span class="ln">2910 </span></a><span class="s0">and there are several.</span>
<a name="l2911"><span class="ln">2911 </span></a>
<a name="l2912"><span class="ln">2912 </span></a>    <span class="s0">Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,</span>
<a name="l2913"><span class="ln">2913 </span></a>      <span class="s0">Kindled a flame I yet deplore,</span>
<a name="l2914"><span class="ln">2914 </span></a>    <span class="s0">The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,</span>
<a name="l2915"><span class="ln">2915 </span></a>    <span class="s0">Though of his near approach afraid,</span>
<a name="l2916"><span class="ln">2916 </span></a>      <span class="s0">So fatal to my suit before.</span>
<a name="l2917"><span class="ln">2917 </span></a>
<a name="l2918"><span class="ln">2918 </span></a><span class="s0">And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever</span>
<a name="l2919"><span class="ln">2919 </span></a><span class="s0">all the way through.  But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2920"><span class="ln">2920 </span></a>
<a name="l2921"><span class="ln">2921 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page.  We copied it</span>
<a name="l2922"><span class="ln">2922 </span></a><span class="s0">from the Elegant Extracts.  It was Garrick's, you know.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2923"><span class="ln">2923 </span></a>
<a name="l2924"><span class="ln">2924 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.</span>
<a name="l2925"><span class="ln">2925 </span></a>
<a name="l2926"><span class="ln">2926 </span></a>    <span class="s0">Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.</span>
<a name="l2927"><span class="ln">2927 </span></a>
<a name="l2928"><span class="ln">2928 </span></a><span class="s0">The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near</span>
<a name="l2929"><span class="ln">2929 </span></a><span class="s0">being christened Catherine after her grandmama.  I hope we shall</span>
<a name="l2930"><span class="ln">2930 </span></a><span class="s0">have her here next week.  Have you thought, my dear, where you</span>
<a name="l2931"><span class="ln">2931 </span></a><span class="s0">shall put her--and what room there will be for the children?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2932"><span class="ln">2932 </span></a>
<a name="l2933"><span class="ln">2933 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always</span>
<a name="l2934"><span class="ln">2934 </span></a><span class="s0">has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual,</span>
<a name="l2935"><span class="ln">2935 </span></a><span class="s0">you know.  Why should there be any change?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2936"><span class="ln">2936 </span></a>
<a name="l2937"><span class="ln">2937 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not</span>
<a name="l2938"><span class="ln">2938 </span></a><span class="s0">since last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley's</span>
<a name="l2939"><span class="ln">2939 </span></a><span class="s0">being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly</span>
<a name="l2940"><span class="ln">2940 </span></a><span class="s0">taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes,</span>
<a name="l2941"><span class="ln">2941 </span></a><span class="s0">not to see Miss Taylor here!&quot;</span>
<a name="l2942"><span class="ln">2942 </span></a>
<a name="l2943"><span class="ln">2943 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She will not be surprized, papa, at least.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2944"><span class="ln">2944 </span></a>
<a name="l2945"><span class="ln">2945 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not know, my dear.  I am sure I was very much surprized</span>
<a name="l2946"><span class="ln">2946 </span></a><span class="s0">when I first heard she was going to be married.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2947"><span class="ln">2947 </span></a>
<a name="l2948"><span class="ln">2948 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella</span>
<a name="l2949"><span class="ln">2949 </span></a><span class="s0">is here.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2950"><span class="ln">2950 </span></a>
<a name="l2951"><span class="ln">2951 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she</span>
<a name="l2952"><span class="ln">2952 </span></a><span class="s0">is coming for only one week.  There will not be time for any thing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2953"><span class="ln">2953 </span></a>
<a name="l2954"><span class="ln">2954 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case</span>
<a name="l2955"><span class="ln">2955 </span></a><span class="s0">of necessity.  Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th,</span>
<a name="l2956"><span class="ln">2956 </span></a><span class="s0">and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole</span>
<a name="l2957"><span class="ln">2957 </span></a><span class="s0">of the time they can give to the country, that two or three days</span>
<a name="l2958"><span class="ln">2958 </span></a><span class="s0">are not to be taken out for the Abbey.  Mr. Knightley promises</span>
<a name="l2959"><span class="ln">2959 </span></a><span class="s0">to give up his claim this Christmas--though you know it is longer</span>
<a name="l2960"><span class="ln">2960 </span></a><span class="s0">since they were with him, than with us.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2961"><span class="ln">2961 </span></a>
<a name="l2962"><span class="ln">2962 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were</span>
<a name="l2963"><span class="ln">2963 </span></a><span class="s0">to be anywhere but at Hartfield.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2964"><span class="ln">2964 </span></a>
<a name="l2965"><span class="ln">2965 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on</span>
<a name="l2966"><span class="ln">2966 </span></a><span class="s0">his brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own.</span>
<a name="l2967"><span class="ln">2967 </span></a><span class="s0">He sat musing a little while, and then said,</span>
<a name="l2968"><span class="ln">2968 </span></a>
<a name="l2969"><span class="ln">2969 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back</span>
<a name="l2970"><span class="ln">2970 </span></a><span class="s0">so soon, though he does.  I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade</span>
<a name="l2971"><span class="ln">2971 </span></a><span class="s0">her to stay longer with us.  She and the children might stay very well.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2972"><span class="ln">2972 </span></a>
<a name="l2973"><span class="ln">2973 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish,</span>
<a name="l2974"><span class="ln">2974 </span></a><span class="s0">and I do not think you ever will.  Isabella cannot bear to stay</span>
<a name="l2975"><span class="ln">2975 </span></a><span class="s0">behind her husband.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2976"><span class="ln">2976 </span></a>
<a name="l2977"><span class="ln">2977 </span></a><span class="s0">This was too true for contradiction.  Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l2978"><span class="ln">2978 </span></a><span class="s0">could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits</span>
<a name="l2979"><span class="ln">2979 </span></a><span class="s0">affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband,</span>
<a name="l2980"><span class="ln">2980 </span></a><span class="s0">she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.</span>
<a name="l2981"><span class="ln">2981 </span></a>
<a name="l2982"><span class="ln">2982 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while</span>
<a name="l2983"><span class="ln">2983 </span></a><span class="s0">my brother and sister are here.  I am sure she will be pleased</span>
<a name="l2984"><span class="ln">2984 </span></a><span class="s0">with the children.  We are very proud of the children, are not we,</span>
<a name="l2985"><span class="ln">2985 </span></a><span class="s0">papa? I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?&quot;</span>
<a name="l2986"><span class="ln">2986 </span></a>
<a name="l2987"><span class="ln">2987 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Aye, I wonder which she will.  Poor little dears, how glad they</span>
<a name="l2988"><span class="ln">2988 </span></a><span class="s0">will be to come.  They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2989"><span class="ln">2989 </span></a>
<a name="l2990"><span class="ln">2990 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I dare say they are, sir.  I am sure I do not know who is not.&quot;</span>
<a name="l2991"><span class="ln">2991 </span></a>
<a name="l2992"><span class="ln">2992 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama.  Henry is the eldest,</span>
<a name="l2993"><span class="ln">2993 </span></a><span class="s0">he was named after me, not after his father.  John, the second,</span>
<a name="l2994"><span class="ln">2994 </span></a><span class="s0">is named after his father.  Some people are surprized, I believe,</span>
<a name="l2995"><span class="ln">2995 </span></a><span class="s0">that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry,</span>
<a name="l2996"><span class="ln">2996 </span></a><span class="s0">which I thought very pretty of her.  And he is a very clever boy,</span>
<a name="l2997"><span class="ln">2997 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed.  They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many</span>
<a name="l2998"><span class="ln">2998 </span></a><span class="s0">pretty ways.  They will come and stand by my chair, and say,</span>
<a name="l2999"><span class="ln">2999 </span></a><span class="s0">`Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?' and once Henry asked me</span>
<a name="l3000"><span class="ln">3000 </span></a><span class="s0">for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas.</span>
<a name="l3001"><span class="ln">3001 </span></a><span class="s0">I think their father is too rough with them very often.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3002"><span class="ln">3002 </span></a>
<a name="l3003"><span class="ln">3003 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He appears rough to you,&quot; said Emma, &quot;because you are so very</span>
<a name="l3004"><span class="ln">3004 </span></a><span class="s0">gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas,</span>
<a name="l3005"><span class="ln">3005 </span></a><span class="s0">you would not think him rough.  He wishes his boys to be active and hardy;</span>
<a name="l3006"><span class="ln">3006 </span></a><span class="s0">and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then;</span>
<a name="l3007"><span class="ln">3007 </span></a><span class="s0">but he is an affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley</span>
<a name="l3008"><span class="ln">3008 </span></a><span class="s0">is an affectionate father.  The children are all fond of him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3009"><span class="ln">3009 </span></a>
<a name="l3010"><span class="ln">3010 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling</span>
<a name="l3011"><span class="ln">3011 </span></a><span class="s0">in a very frightful way!&quot;</span>
<a name="l3012"><span class="ln">3012 </span></a>
<a name="l3013"><span class="ln">3013 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much.</span>
<a name="l3014"><span class="ln">3014 </span></a><span class="s0">It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down</span>
<a name="l3015"><span class="ln">3015 </span></a><span class="s0">the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way</span>
<a name="l3016"><span class="ln">3016 </span></a><span class="s0">to the other.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3017"><span class="ln">3017 </span></a>
<a name="l3018"><span class="ln">3018 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, I cannot understand it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3019"><span class="ln">3019 </span></a>
<a name="l3020"><span class="ln">3020 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That is the case with us all, papa.  One half of the world cannot</span>
<a name="l3021"><span class="ln">3021 </span></a><span class="s0">understand the pleasures of the other.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3022"><span class="ln">3022 </span></a>
<a name="l3023"><span class="ln">3023 </span></a><span class="s0">Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate</span>
<a name="l3024"><span class="ln">3024 </span></a><span class="s0">in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero</span>
<a name="l3025"><span class="ln">3025 </span></a><span class="s0">of this inimitable charade walked in again.  Harriet turned away;</span>
<a name="l3026"><span class="ln">3026 </span></a><span class="s0">but Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye</span>
<a name="l3027"><span class="ln">3027 </span></a><span class="s0">soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push--of</span>
<a name="l3028"><span class="ln">3028 </span></a><span class="s0">having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it</span>
<a name="l3029"><span class="ln">3029 </span></a><span class="s0">might turn up.  His ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether</span>
<a name="l3030"><span class="ln">3030 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without him,</span>
<a name="l3031"><span class="ln">3031 </span></a><span class="s0">or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l3032"><span class="ln">3032 </span></a><span class="s0">If he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend</span>
<a name="l3033"><span class="ln">3033 </span></a><span class="s0">Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him--had made</span>
<a name="l3034"><span class="ln">3034 </span></a><span class="s0">such a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come.</span>
<a name="l3035"><span class="ln">3035 </span></a>
<a name="l3036"><span class="ln">3036 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his</span>
<a name="l3037"><span class="ln">3037 </span></a><span class="s0">friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber.</span>
<a name="l3038"><span class="ln">3038 </span></a><span class="s0">He re-urged--she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make</span>
<a name="l3039"><span class="ln">3039 </span></a><span class="s0">his bow, when taking the paper from the table, she returned it--</span>
<a name="l3040"><span class="ln">3040 </span></a>
<a name="l3041"><span class="ln">3041 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;</span>
<a name="l3042"><span class="ln">3042 </span></a><span class="s0">thank you for the sight of it.  We admired it so much, that I have</span>
<a name="l3043"><span class="ln">3043 </span></a><span class="s0">ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection.  Your friend</span>
<a name="l3044"><span class="ln">3044 </span></a><span class="s0">will not take it amiss I hope.  Of course I have not transcribed</span>
<a name="l3045"><span class="ln">3045 </span></a><span class="s0">beyond the first eight lines.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3046"><span class="ln">3046 </span></a>
<a name="l3047"><span class="ln">3047 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say.</span>
<a name="l3048"><span class="ln">3048 </span></a><span class="s0">He looked rather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about</span>
<a name="l3049"><span class="ln">3049 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;honour,&quot;--glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book</span>
<a name="l3050"><span class="ln">3050 </span></a><span class="s0">open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively.</span>
<a name="l3051"><span class="ln">3051 </span></a><span class="s0">With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,</span>

<a name="l3053"><span class="ln">3053 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade</span>
<a name="l3054"><span class="ln">3054 </span></a><span class="s0">must not be confined to one or two.  He may be sure of every woman's</span>
<a name="l3055"><span class="ln">3055 </span></a><span class="s0">approbation while he writes with such gallantry.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3056"><span class="ln">3056 </span></a>
<a name="l3057"><span class="ln">3057 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have no hesitation in saying,&quot; replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating</span>
<a name="l3058"><span class="ln">3058 </span></a><span class="s0">a good deal while he spoke; &quot;I have no hesitation in saying--at</span>
<a name="l3059"><span class="ln">3059 </span></a><span class="s0">least if my friend feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest</span>
<a name="l3060"><span class="ln">3060 </span></a><span class="s0">doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it,</span>
<a name="l3061"><span class="ln">3061 </span></a><span class="s0">(looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he</span>
<a name="l3062"><span class="ln">3062 </span></a><span class="s0">would consider it as the proudest moment of his life.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3063"><span class="ln">3063 </span></a>
<a name="l3064"><span class="ln">3064 </span></a><span class="s0">After this speech he was gone as soon as possible.  Emma could not</span>
<a name="l3065"><span class="ln">3065 </span></a><span class="s0">think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities,</span>
<a name="l3066"><span class="ln">3066 </span></a><span class="s0">there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt</span>
<a name="l3067"><span class="ln">3067 </span></a><span class="s0">to incline her to laugh.  She ran away to indulge the inclination,</span>
<a name="l3068"><span class="ln">3068 </span></a><span class="s0">leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.</span>

<a name="l3073"><span class="ln">3073 </span></a>
<a name="l3074"><span class="ln">3074 </span></a>
<a name="l3075"><span class="ln">3075 </span></a><span class="s0">Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather</span>
<a name="l3076"><span class="ln">3076 </span></a><span class="s0">to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise;</span>
<a name="l3077"><span class="ln">3077 </span></a><span class="s0">and on the morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor</span>
<a name="l3078"><span class="ln">3078 </span></a><span class="s0">sick family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.</span>
<a name="l3079"><span class="ln">3079 </span></a>
<a name="l3080"><span class="ln">3080 </span></a><span class="s0">Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane</span>
<a name="l3081"><span class="ln">3081 </span></a><span class="s0">leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street</span>
<a name="l3082"><span class="ln">3082 </span></a><span class="s0">of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode</span>
<a name="l3083"><span class="ln">3083 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Elton.  A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed,</span>
<a name="l3084"><span class="ln">3084 </span></a><span class="s0">and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage,</span>
<a name="l3085"><span class="ln">3085 </span></a><span class="s0">an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it</span>
<a name="l3086"><span class="ln">3086 </span></a><span class="s0">could be.  It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much</span>
<a name="l3087"><span class="ln">3087 </span></a><span class="s0">smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was,</span>
<a name="l3088"><span class="ln">3088 </span></a><span class="s0">there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without</span>
<a name="l3089"><span class="ln">3089 </span></a><span class="s0">a slackened pace and observing eyes.--Emma's remark was--</span>
<a name="l3090"><span class="ln">3090 </span></a>
<a name="l3091"><span class="ln">3091 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There it is.  There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l3092"><span class="ln">3092 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's was--</span>
<a name="l3093"><span class="ln">3093 </span></a>
<a name="l3094"><span class="ln">3094 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow</span>
<a name="l3095"><span class="ln">3095 </span></a><span class="s0">curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3096"><span class="ln">3096 </span></a>
<a name="l3097"><span class="ln">3097 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not often walk this way _now_,&quot; said Emma, as they proceeded,</span>
<a name="l3098"><span class="ln">3098 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get</span>
<a name="l3099"><span class="ln">3099 </span></a><span class="s0">intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards</span>
<a name="l3100"><span class="ln">3100 </span></a><span class="s0">of this part of Highbury.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3101"><span class="ln">3101 </span></a>
<a name="l3102"><span class="ln">3102 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the Vicarage,</span>
<a name="l3103"><span class="ln">3103 </span></a><span class="s0">and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors</span>
<a name="l3104"><span class="ln">3104 </span></a><span class="s0">and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love,</span>
<a name="l3105"><span class="ln">3105 </span></a><span class="s0">with Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.</span>
<a name="l3106"><span class="ln">3106 </span></a>
<a name="l3107"><span class="ln">3107 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I wish we could contrive it,&quot; said she; &quot;but I cannot think</span>
<a name="l3108"><span class="ln">3108 </span></a><span class="s0">of any tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want</span>
<a name="l3109"><span class="ln">3109 </span></a><span class="s0">to inquire about of his housekeeper--no message from my father.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3110"><span class="ln">3110 </span></a>
<a name="l3111"><span class="ln">3111 </span></a><span class="s0">She pondered, but could think of nothing.  After a mutual silence</span>
<a name="l3112"><span class="ln">3112 </span></a><span class="s0">of some minutes, Harriet thus began again--</span>
<a name="l3113"><span class="ln">3113 </span></a>
<a name="l3114"><span class="ln">3114 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married,</span>
<a name="l3115"><span class="ln">3115 </span></a><span class="s0">or going to be married! so charming as you are!&quot;--</span>
<a name="l3116"><span class="ln">3116 </span></a>
<a name="l3117"><span class="ln">3117 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma laughed, and replied,</span>
<a name="l3118"><span class="ln">3118 </span></a>
<a name="l3119"><span class="ln">3119 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;</span>
<a name="l3120"><span class="ln">3120 </span></a><span class="s0">I must find other people charming--one other person at least.</span>
<a name="l3121"><span class="ln">3121 </span></a><span class="s0">And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have</span>
<a name="l3122"><span class="ln">3122 </span></a><span class="s0">very little intention of ever marrying at all.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3123"><span class="ln">3123 </span></a>
<a name="l3124"><span class="ln">3124 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3125"><span class="ln">3125 </span></a>
<a name="l3126"><span class="ln">3126 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet,</span>
<a name="l3127"><span class="ln">3127 </span></a><span class="s0">to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,)</span>
<a name="l3128"><span class="ln">3128 </span></a><span class="s0">is out of the question:  and I do _not_ wish to see any such person.</span>
<a name="l3129"><span class="ln">3129 </span></a><span class="s0">I would rather not be tempted.  I cannot really change for the better.</span>
<a name="l3130"><span class="ln">3130 </span></a><span class="s0">If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3131"><span class="ln">3131 </span></a>
<a name="l3132"><span class="ln">3132 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!&quot;--</span>
<a name="l3133"><span class="ln">3133 </span></a>
<a name="l3134"><span class="ln">3134 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry.</span>
<a name="l3135"><span class="ln">3135 </span></a><span class="s0">Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing!</span>
<a name="l3136"><span class="ln">3136 </span></a><span class="s0">but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature;</span>
<a name="l3137"><span class="ln">3137 </span></a><span class="s0">and I do not think I ever shall.  And, without love, I am sure I</span>
<a name="l3138"><span class="ln">3138 </span></a><span class="s0">should be a fool to change such a situation as mine.  Fortune I</span>
<a name="l3139"><span class="ln">3139 </span></a><span class="s0">do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want:</span>
<a name="l3140"><span class="ln">3140 </span></a><span class="s0">I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their</span>
<a name="l3141"><span class="ln">3141 </span></a><span class="s0">husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect</span>
<a name="l3142"><span class="ln">3142 </span></a><span class="s0">to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always</span>
<a name="l3143"><span class="ln">3143 </span></a><span class="s0">right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3144"><span class="ln">3144 </span></a>
<a name="l3145"><span class="ln">3145 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!&quot;</span>
<a name="l3146"><span class="ln">3146 </span></a>
<a name="l3147"><span class="ln">3147 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I</span>
<a name="l3148"><span class="ln">3148 </span></a><span class="s0">thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--</span>
<a name="l3149"><span class="ln">3149 </span></a><span class="s0">so smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--</span>
<a name="l3150"><span class="ln">3150 </span></a><span class="s0">and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me,</span>
<a name="l3151"><span class="ln">3151 </span></a><span class="s0">I would marry to-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never</span>
<a name="l3152"><span class="ln">3152 </span></a><span class="s0">can be any likeness, except in being unmarried.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3153"><span class="ln">3153 </span></a>
<a name="l3154"><span class="ln">3154 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!&quot;</span>
<a name="l3155"><span class="ln">3155 </span></a>
<a name="l3156"><span class="ln">3156 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is</span>
<a name="l3157"><span class="ln">3157 </span></a><span class="s0">poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!</span>
<a name="l3158"><span class="ln">3158 </span></a><span class="s0">A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,</span>
<a name="l3159"><span class="ln">3159 </span></a><span class="s0">disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls,</span>
<a name="l3160"><span class="ln">3160 </span></a><span class="s0">but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable,</span>
<a name="l3161"><span class="ln">3161 </span></a><span class="s0">and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else.  And the</span>
<a name="l3162"><span class="ln">3162 </span></a><span class="s0">distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common</span>
<a name="l3163"><span class="ln">3163 </span></a><span class="s0">sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income</span>
<a name="l3164"><span class="ln">3164 </span></a><span class="s0">has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.</span>
<a name="l3165"><span class="ln">3165 </span></a><span class="s0">Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small,</span>
<a name="l3166"><span class="ln">3166 </span></a><span class="s0">and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross.</span>
<a name="l3167"><span class="ln">3167 </span></a><span class="s0">This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good</span>
<a name="l3168"><span class="ln">3168 </span></a><span class="s0">natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very</span>
<a name="l3169"><span class="ln">3169 </span></a><span class="s0">much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor.</span>
<a name="l3170"><span class="ln">3170 </span></a><span class="s0">Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind:  I really believe,</span>
<a name="l3171"><span class="ln">3171 </span></a><span class="s0">if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely</span>
<a name="l3172"><span class="ln">3172 </span></a><span class="s0">to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her:  that is a</span>
<a name="l3173"><span class="ln">3173 </span></a><span class="s0">great charm.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3174"><span class="ln">3174 </span></a>
<a name="l3175"><span class="ln">3175 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself</span>
<a name="l3176"><span class="ln">3176 </span></a><span class="s0">when you grow old?&quot;</span>
<a name="l3177"><span class="ln">3177 </span></a>
<a name="l3178"><span class="ln">3178 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great</span>
<a name="l3179"><span class="ln">3179 </span></a><span class="s0">many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be</span>
<a name="l3180"><span class="ln">3180 </span></a><span class="s0">more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.</span>
<a name="l3181"><span class="ln">3181 </span></a><span class="s0">Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then</span>
<a name="l3182"><span class="ln">3182 </span></a><span class="s0">as they are now; or with no important variation.  If I draw less,</span>
<a name="l3183"><span class="ln">3183 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work.</span>
<a name="l3184"><span class="ln">3184 </span></a><span class="s0">And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections,</span>
<a name="l3185"><span class="ln">3185 </span></a><span class="s0">which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which</span>
<a name="l3186"><span class="ln">3186 </span></a><span class="s0">is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall</span>
<a name="l3187"><span class="ln">3187 </span></a><span class="s0">be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much,</span>
<a name="l3188"><span class="ln">3188 </span></a><span class="s0">to care about.  There will be enough of them, in all probability,</span>
<a name="l3189"><span class="ln">3189 </span></a><span class="s0">to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need.</span>
<a name="l3190"><span class="ln">3190 </span></a><span class="s0">There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my</span>
<a name="l3191"><span class="ln">3191 </span></a><span class="s0">attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas</span>
<a name="l3192"><span class="ln">3192 </span></a><span class="s0">of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.  My nephews</span>
<a name="l3193"><span class="ln">3193 </span></a><span class="s0">and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3194"><span class="ln">3194 </span></a>
<a name="l3195"><span class="ln">3195 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Do you know Miss Bates's niece?  That is, I know you must have</span>
<a name="l3196"><span class="ln">3196 </span></a><span class="s0">seen her a hundred times--but are you acquainted?&quot;</span>
<a name="l3197"><span class="ln">3197 </span></a>
<a name="l3198"><span class="ln">3198 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes</span>
<a name="l3199"><span class="ln">3199 </span></a><span class="s0">to Highbury.  By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out</span>
<a name="l3200"><span class="ln">3200 </span></a><span class="s0">of conceit with a niece.  Heaven forbid! at least, that I should</span>
<a name="l3201"><span class="ln">3201 </span></a><span class="s0">ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together,</span>
<a name="l3202"><span class="ln">3202 </span></a><span class="s0">as she does about Jane Fairfax.  One is sick of the very name</span>
<a name="l3203"><span class="ln">3203 </span></a><span class="s0">of Jane Fairfax.  Every letter from her is read forty times over;</span>
<a name="l3204"><span class="ln">3204 </span></a><span class="s0">her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she</span>
<a name="l3205"><span class="ln">3205 </span></a><span class="s0">does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair</span>
<a name="l3206"><span class="ln">3206 </span></a><span class="s0">of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.</span>
<a name="l3207"><span class="ln">3207 </span></a><span class="s0">I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3208"><span class="ln">3208 </span></a>
<a name="l3209"><span class="ln">3209 </span></a><span class="s0">They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics</span>
<a name="l3210"><span class="ln">3210 </span></a><span class="s0">were superseded.  Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses</span>
<a name="l3211"><span class="ln">3211 </span></a><span class="s0">of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention</span>
<a name="l3212"><span class="ln">3212 </span></a><span class="s0">and kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse.</span>
<a name="l3213"><span class="ln">3213 </span></a><span class="s0">She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and</span>
<a name="l3214"><span class="ln">3214 </span></a><span class="s0">their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary</span>
<a name="l3215"><span class="ln">3215 </span></a><span class="s0">virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into</span>
<a name="l3216"><span class="ln">3216 </span></a><span class="s0">their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance</span>
<a name="l3217"><span class="ln">3217 </span></a><span class="s0">with as much intelligence as good-will.  In the present instance,</span>
<a name="l3218"><span class="ln">3218 </span></a><span class="s0">it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit;</span>
<a name="l3219"><span class="ln">3219 </span></a><span class="s0">and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice,</span>
<a name="l3220"><span class="ln">3220 </span></a><span class="s0">she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene</span>
<a name="l3221"><span class="ln">3221 </span></a><span class="s0">as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,</span>
<a name="l3222"><span class="ln">3222 </span></a>
<a name="l3223"><span class="ln">3223 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.  How trifling they</span>
<a name="l3224"><span class="ln">3224 </span></a><span class="s0">make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of</span>
<a name="l3225"><span class="ln">3225 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet,</span>
<a name="l3226"><span class="ln">3226 </span></a><span class="s0">who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?&quot;</span>
<a name="l3227"><span class="ln">3227 </span></a>
<a name="l3228"><span class="ln">3228 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very true,&quot; said Harriet.  &quot;Poor creatures! one can think</span>
<a name="l3229"><span class="ln">3229 </span></a><span class="s0">of nothing else.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3230"><span class="ln">3230 </span></a>
<a name="l3231"><span class="ln">3231 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,&quot;</span>
<a name="l3232"><span class="ln">3232 </span></a><span class="s0">said Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep</span>
<a name="l3233"><span class="ln">3233 </span></a><span class="s0">which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden,</span>
<a name="l3234"><span class="ln">3234 </span></a><span class="s0">and brought them into the lane again.  &quot;I do not think it will,&quot;</span>
<a name="l3235"><span class="ln">3235 </span></a><span class="s0">stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place,</span>
<a name="l3236"><span class="ln">3236 </span></a><span class="s0">and recall the still greater within.</span>
<a name="l3237"><span class="ln">3237 </span></a>
<a name="l3238"><span class="ln">3238 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! dear, no,&quot; said her companion.</span>
<a name="l3239"><span class="ln">3239 </span></a>
<a name="l3240"><span class="ln">3240 </span></a><span class="s0">They walked on.  The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend</span>
<a name="l3241"><span class="ln">3241 </span></a><span class="s0">was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near</span>
<a name="l3242"><span class="ln">3242 </span></a><span class="s0">as to give Emma time only to say farther,</span>
<a name="l3243"><span class="ln">3243 </span></a>
<a name="l3244"><span class="ln">3244 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!  Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability</span>
<a name="l3245"><span class="ln">3245 </span></a><span class="s0">in good thoughts.  Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that</span>
<a name="l3246"><span class="ln">3246 </span></a><span class="s0">if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers,</span>
<a name="l3247"><span class="ln">3247 </span></a><span class="s0">it has done all that is truly important.  If we feel for the wretched,</span>
<a name="l3248"><span class="ln">3248 </span></a><span class="s0">enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy,</span>
<a name="l3249"><span class="ln">3249 </span></a><span class="s0">only distressing to ourselves.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3250"><span class="ln">3250 </span></a>
<a name="l3251"><span class="ln">3251 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet could just answer, &quot;Oh! dear, yes,&quot; before the gentleman</span>
<a name="l3252"><span class="ln">3252 </span></a><span class="s0">joined them.  The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,</span>
<a name="l3253"><span class="ln">3253 </span></a><span class="s0">were the first subject on meeting.  He had been going to call</span>
<a name="l3254"><span class="ln">3254 </span></a><span class="s0">on them.  His visit he would now defer; but they had a very</span>
<a name="l3255"><span class="ln">3255 </span></a><span class="s0">interesting parley about what could be done and should be done.</span>
<a name="l3256"><span class="ln">3256 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.</span>
<a name="l3257"><span class="ln">3257 </span></a>
<a name="l3258"><span class="ln">3258 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,&quot; thought Emma;</span>
<a name="l3259"><span class="ln">3259 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase</span>
<a name="l3260"><span class="ln">3260 </span></a><span class="s0">of love on each side.  I should not wonder if it were to bring</span>
<a name="l3261"><span class="ln">3261 </span></a><span class="s0">on the declaration.  It must, if I were not here.  I wish I were</span>
<a name="l3262"><span class="ln">3262 </span></a><span class="s0">anywhere else.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3263"><span class="ln">3263 </span></a>
<a name="l3264"><span class="ln">3264 </span></a><span class="s0">Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon</span>
<a name="l3265"><span class="ln">3265 </span></a><span class="s0">afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised</span>
<a name="l3266"><span class="ln">3266 </span></a><span class="s0">on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road.</span>
<a name="l3267"><span class="ln">3267 </span></a><span class="s0">But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's</span>
<a name="l3268"><span class="ln">3268 </span></a><span class="s0">habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,</span>
<a name="l3269"><span class="ln">3269 </span></a><span class="s0">in short, they would both be soon after her.  This would not do;</span>
<a name="l3270"><span class="ln">3270 </span></a><span class="s0">she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration</span>
<a name="l3271"><span class="ln">3271 </span></a><span class="s0">to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete</span>
<a name="l3272"><span class="ln">3272 </span></a><span class="s0">occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on,</span>
<a name="l3273"><span class="ln">3273 </span></a><span class="s0">and she would follow in half a minute.  They did as they were desired;</span>
<a name="l3274"><span class="ln">3274 </span></a><span class="s0">and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot,</span>
<a name="l3275"><span class="ln">3275 </span></a><span class="s0">she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken</span>
<a name="l3276"><span class="ln">3276 </span></a><span class="s0">by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders,</span>
<a name="l3277"><span class="ln">3277 </span></a><span class="s0">with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.  To walk by the side</span>
<a name="l3278"><span class="ln">3278 </span></a><span class="s0">of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural</span>
<a name="l3279"><span class="ln">3279 </span></a><span class="s0">thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been</span>
<a name="l3280"><span class="ln">3280 </span></a><span class="s0">acting just then without design; and by this means the others were</span>
<a name="l3281"><span class="ln">3281 </span></a><span class="s0">still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her.</span>
<a name="l3282"><span class="ln">3282 </span></a><span class="s0">She gained on them, however, involuntarily:  the child's pace was quick,</span>
<a name="l3283"><span class="ln">3283 </span></a><span class="s0">and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it,</span>
<a name="l3284"><span class="ln">3284 </span></a><span class="s0">from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them.</span>
<a name="l3285"><span class="ln">3285 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very</span>
<a name="l3286"><span class="ln">3286 </span></a><span class="s0">pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning</span>
<a name="l3287"><span class="ln">3287 </span></a><span class="s0">to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both</span>
<a name="l3288"><span class="ln">3288 </span></a><span class="s0">looked around, and she was obliged to join them.</span>
<a name="l3289"><span class="ln">3289 </span></a>
<a name="l3290"><span class="ln">3290 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;</span>
<a name="l3291"><span class="ln">3291 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he</span>
<a name="l3292"><span class="ln">3292 </span></a><span class="s0">was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's</span>
<a name="l3293"><span class="ln">3293 </span></a><span class="s0">party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for</span>
<a name="l3294"><span class="ln">3294 </span></a><span class="s0">the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery,</span>
<a name="l3295"><span class="ln">3295 </span></a><span class="s0">the beet-root, and all the dessert.</span>
<a name="l3296"><span class="ln">3296 </span></a>
<a name="l3297"><span class="ln">3297 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This would soon have led to something better, of course,&quot; was her</span>
<a name="l3298"><span class="ln">3298 </span></a><span class="s0">consoling reflection; &quot;any thing interests between those who love;</span>
<a name="l3299"><span class="ln">3299 </span></a><span class="s0">and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.</span>
<a name="l3300"><span class="ln">3300 </span></a><span class="s0">If I could but have kept longer away!&quot;</span>
<a name="l3301"><span class="ln">3301 </span></a>
<a name="l3302"><span class="ln">3302 </span></a><span class="s0">They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage</span>
<a name="l3303"><span class="ln">3303 </span></a><span class="s0">pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into</span>
<a name="l3304"><span class="ln">3304 </span></a><span class="s0">the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,</span>
<a name="l3305"><span class="ln">3305 </span></a><span class="s0">and fall behind to arrange it once more.  She then broke the lace</span>
<a name="l3306"><span class="ln">3306 </span></a><span class="s0">off short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently</span>
<a name="l3307"><span class="ln">3307 </span></a><span class="s0">obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to</span>
<a name="l3308"><span class="ln">3308 </span></a><span class="s0">put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.</span>
<a name="l3309"><span class="ln">3309 </span></a>
<a name="l3310"><span class="ln">3310 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Part of my lace is gone,&quot; said she, &quot;and I do not know how I am</span>
<a name="l3311"><span class="ln">3311 </span></a><span class="s0">to contrive.  I really am a most troublesome companion to you both,</span>
<a name="l3312"><span class="ln">3312 </span></a><span class="s0">but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg</span>
<a name="l3313"><span class="ln">3313 </span></a><span class="s0">leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit</span>
<a name="l3314"><span class="ln">3314 </span></a><span class="s0">of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3315"><span class="ln">3315 </span></a>
<a name="l3316"><span class="ln">3316 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing</span>
<a name="l3317"><span class="ln">3317 </span></a><span class="s0">could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into</span>
<a name="l3318"><span class="ln">3318 </span></a><span class="s0">his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.</span>
<a name="l3319"><span class="ln">3319 </span></a><span class="s0">The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied,</span>
<a name="l3320"><span class="ln">3320 </span></a><span class="s0">and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately</span>
<a name="l3321"><span class="ln">3321 </span></a><span class="s0">communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed</span>
<a name="l3322"><span class="ln">3322 </span></a><span class="s0">into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most</span>
<a name="l3323"><span class="ln">3323 </span></a><span class="s0">comfortable manner.  She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she</span>
<a name="l3324"><span class="ln">3324 </span></a><span class="s0">found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it.</span>
<a name="l3325"><span class="ln">3325 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging</span>
<a name="l3326"><span class="ln">3326 </span></a><span class="s0">the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it</span>
<a name="l3327"><span class="ln">3327 </span></a><span class="s0">practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room.</span>
<a name="l3328"><span class="ln">3328 </span></a><span class="s0">For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.  It could</span>
<a name="l3329"><span class="ln">3329 </span></a><span class="s0">be protracted no longer.  She was then obliged to be finished,</span>
<a name="l3330"><span class="ln">3330 </span></a><span class="s0">and make her appearance.</span>
<a name="l3331"><span class="ln">3331 </span></a>
<a name="l3332"><span class="ln">3332 </span></a><span class="s0">The lovers were standing together at one of the windows.  It had a</span>
<a name="l3333"><span class="ln">3333 </span></a><span class="s0">most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory</span>
<a name="l3334"><span class="ln">3334 </span></a><span class="s0">of having schemed successfully.  But it would not do; he had not</span>
<a name="l3335"><span class="ln">3335 </span></a><span class="s0">come to the point.  He had been most agreeable, most delightful;</span>
<a name="l3336"><span class="ln">3336 </span></a><span class="s0">he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely</span>
<a name="l3337"><span class="ln">3337 </span></a><span class="s0">followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt,</span>
<a name="l3338"><span class="ln">3338 </span></a><span class="s0">but nothing serious.</span>
<a name="l3339"><span class="ln">3339 </span></a>
<a name="l3340"><span class="ln">3340 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Cautious, very cautious,&quot; thought Emma; &quot;he advances inch by inch,</span>
<a name="l3341"><span class="ln">3341 </span></a><span class="s0">and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3342"><span class="ln">3342 </span></a>
<a name="l3343"><span class="ln">3343 </span></a><span class="s0">Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished</span>
<a name="l3344"><span class="ln">3344 </span></a><span class="s0">by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself</span>
<a name="l3345"><span class="ln">3345 </span></a><span class="s0">that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both,</span>
<a name="l3346"><span class="ln">3346 </span></a><span class="s0">and must be leading them forward to the great event.</span>
<a name="l3347"><span class="ln">3347 </span></a>

<a name="l3350"><span class="ln">3350 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>
<a name="l3351"><span class="ln">3351 </span></a>
<a name="l3352"><span class="ln">3352 </span></a>
<a name="l3353"><span class="ln">3353 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton must now be left to himself.  It was no longer in Emma's</span>
<a name="l3354"><span class="ln">3354 </span></a><span class="s0">power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures.</span>
<a name="l3355"><span class="ln">3355 </span></a><span class="s0">The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand,</span>
<a name="l3356"><span class="ln">3356 </span></a><span class="s0">that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth</span>
<a name="l3357"><span class="ln">3357 </span></a><span class="s0">her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay</span>
<a name="l3358"><span class="ln">3358 </span></a><span class="s0">at Hartfield it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect--</span>
<a name="l3359"><span class="ln">3359 </span></a><span class="s0">that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could</span>
<a name="l3360"><span class="ln">3360 </span></a><span class="s0">be afforded by her to the lovers.  They might advance rapidly</span>
<a name="l3361"><span class="ln">3361 </span></a><span class="s0">if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether</span>
<a name="l3362"><span class="ln">3362 </span></a><span class="s0">they would or no.  She hardly wished to have more leisure for them.</span>
<a name="l3363"><span class="ln">3363 </span></a><span class="s0">There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will</span>
<a name="l3364"><span class="ln">3364 </span></a><span class="s0">do for themselves.</span>
<a name="l3365"><span class="ln">3365 </span></a>
<a name="l3366"><span class="ln">3366 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual</span>
<a name="l3367"><span class="ln">3367 </span></a><span class="s0">absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the</span>
<a name="l3368"><span class="ln">3368 </span></a><span class="s0">usual interest.  Till this year, every long vacation since their</span>
<a name="l3369"><span class="ln">3369 </span></a><span class="s0">marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey;</span>
<a name="l3370"><span class="ln">3370 </span></a><span class="s0">but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing</span>
<a name="l3371"><span class="ln">3371 </span></a><span class="s0">for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had</span>
<a name="l3372"><span class="ln">3372 </span></a><span class="s0">been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all</span>
<a name="l3373"><span class="ln">3373 </span></a><span class="s0">by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London,</span>
<a name="l3374"><span class="ln">3374 </span></a><span class="s0">even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most</span>
<a name="l3375"><span class="ln">3375 </span></a><span class="s0">nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.</span>
<a name="l3376"><span class="ln">3376 </span></a>
<a name="l3377"><span class="ln">3377 </span></a><span class="s0">He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a</span>
<a name="l3378"><span class="ln">3378 </span></a><span class="s0">little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to</span>
<a name="l3379"><span class="ln">3379 </span></a><span class="s0">bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms</span>
<a name="l3380"><span class="ln">3380 </span></a><span class="s0">were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished,</span>
<a name="l3381"><span class="ln">3381 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent</span>
<a name="l3382"><span class="ln">3382 </span></a><span class="s0">number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.</span>
<a name="l3383"><span class="ln">3383 </span></a><span class="s0">The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to,</span>
<a name="l3384"><span class="ln">3384 </span></a><span class="s0">welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of,</span>
<a name="l3385"><span class="ln">3385 </span></a><span class="s0">produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne</span>
<a name="l3386"><span class="ln">3386 </span></a><span class="s0">under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this;</span>
<a name="l3387"><span class="ln">3387 </span></a><span class="s0">but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were</span>
<a name="l3388"><span class="ln">3388 </span></a><span class="s0">so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal</span>
<a name="l3389"><span class="ln">3389 </span></a><span class="s0">solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones,</span>
<a name="l3390"><span class="ln">3390 </span></a><span class="s0">and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance,</span>
<a name="l3391"><span class="ln">3391 </span></a><span class="s0">all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,</span>
<a name="l3392"><span class="ln">3392 </span></a><span class="s0">which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay,</span>
<a name="l3393"><span class="ln">3393 </span></a><span class="s0">the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him,</span>
<a name="l3394"><span class="ln">3394 </span></a><span class="s0">either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.</span>
<a name="l3395"><span class="ln">3395 </span></a>
<a name="l3396"><span class="ln">3396 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,</span>
<a name="l3397"><span class="ln">3397 </span></a><span class="s0">quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;</span>
<a name="l3398"><span class="ln">3398 </span></a><span class="s0">wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother,</span>
<a name="l3399"><span class="ln">3399 </span></a><span class="s0">and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for</span>
<a name="l3400"><span class="ln">3400 </span></a><span class="s0">these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.</span>
<a name="l3401"><span class="ln">3401 </span></a><span class="s0">She could never see a fault in any of them.  She was not a woman</span>
<a name="l3402"><span class="ln">3402 </span></a><span class="s0">of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance</span>
<a name="l3403"><span class="ln">3403 </span></a><span class="s0">of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution;</span>
<a name="l3404"><span class="ln">3404 </span></a><span class="s0">was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children,</span>
<a name="l3405"><span class="ln">3405 </span></a><span class="s0">had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield</span>
<a name="l3406"><span class="ln">3406 </span></a><span class="s0">in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.  They were alike too,</span>
<a name="l3407"><span class="ln">3407 </span></a><span class="s0">in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard</span>
<a name="l3408"><span class="ln">3408 </span></a><span class="s0">for every old acquaintance.</span>
<a name="l3409"><span class="ln">3409 </span></a>
<a name="l3410"><span class="ln">3410 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;</span>
<a name="l3411"><span class="ln">3411 </span></a><span class="s0">rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his</span>
<a name="l3412"><span class="ln">3412 </span></a><span class="s0">private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being</span>
<a name="l3413"><span class="ln">3413 </span></a><span class="s0">generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour.</span>
<a name="l3414"><span class="ln">3414 </span></a><span class="s0">He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross</span>
<a name="l3415"><span class="ln">3415 </span></a><span class="s0">as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his</span>
<a name="l3416"><span class="ln">3416 </span></a><span class="s0">great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife,</span>
<a name="l3417"><span class="ln">3417 </span></a><span class="s0">it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not</span>
<a name="l3418"><span class="ln">3418 </span></a><span class="s0">be increased.  The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.</span>
<a name="l3419"><span class="ln">3419 </span></a><span class="s0">He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted,</span>
<a name="l3420"><span class="ln">3420 </span></a><span class="s0">and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.</span>
<a name="l3421"><span class="ln">3421 </span></a>
<a name="l3422"><span class="ln">3422 </span></a><span class="s0">He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing</span>
<a name="l3423"><span class="ln">3423 </span></a><span class="s0">wrong in him escaped her.  She was quick in feeling the little</span>
<a name="l3424"><span class="ln">3424 </span></a><span class="s0">injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself.</span>
<a name="l3425"><span class="ln">3425 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been</span>
<a name="l3426"><span class="ln">3426 </span></a><span class="s0">flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly</span>
<a name="l3427"><span class="ln">3427 </span></a><span class="s0">kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness;</span>
<a name="l3428"><span class="ln">3428 </span></a><span class="s0">but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her</span>
<a name="l3429"><span class="ln">3429 </span></a><span class="s0">regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes</span>
<a name="l3430"><span class="ln">3430 </span></a><span class="s0">fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father.</span>
<a name="l3431"><span class="ln">3431 </span></a><span class="s0">There he had not always the patience that could have been wished.</span>
<a name="l3432"><span class="ln">3432 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking</span>
<a name="l3433"><span class="ln">3433 </span></a><span class="s0">him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.</span>
<a name="l3434"><span class="ln">3434 </span></a><span class="s0">It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great</span>
<a name="l3435"><span class="ln">3435 </span></a><span class="s0">regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was</span>
<a name="l3436"><span class="ln">3436 </span></a><span class="s0">due to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as</span>
<a name="l3437"><span class="ln">3437 </span></a><span class="s0">there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured,</span>
<a name="l3438"><span class="ln">3438 </span></a><span class="s0">though the offence came not.  The beginning, however, of every visit</span>
<a name="l3439"><span class="ln">3439 </span></a><span class="s0">displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity</span>
<a name="l3440"><span class="ln">3440 </span></a><span class="s0">so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.</span>
<a name="l3441"><span class="ln">3441 </span></a><span class="s0">They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l3442"><span class="ln">3442 </span></a><span class="s0">with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's</span>
<a name="l3443"><span class="ln">3443 </span></a><span class="s0">attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.</span>
<a name="l3444"><span class="ln">3444 </span></a>
<a name="l3445"><span class="ln">3445 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah, my dear,&quot; said he, &quot;poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3446"><span class="ln">3446 </span></a>
<a name="l3447"><span class="ln">3447 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, sir,&quot; cried she with ready sympathy, &quot;how you must</span>
<a name="l3448"><span class="ln">3448 </span></a><span class="s0">miss her!  And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--</span>
<a name="l3449"><span class="ln">3449 </span></a><span class="s0">I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could</span>
<a name="l3450"><span class="ln">3450 </span></a><span class="s0">possibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope</span>
<a name="l3451"><span class="ln">3451 </span></a><span class="s0">she is pretty well, sir.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3452"><span class="ln">3452 </span></a>
<a name="l3453"><span class="ln">3453 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know</span>
<a name="l3454"><span class="ln">3454 </span></a><span class="s0">but that the place agrees with her tolerably.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3455"><span class="ln">3455 </span></a>
<a name="l3456"><span class="ln">3456 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any</span>
<a name="l3457"><span class="ln">3457 </span></a><span class="s0">doubts of the air of Randalls.</span>
<a name="l3458"><span class="ln">3458 </span></a>
<a name="l3459"><span class="ln">3459 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no--none in the least.  I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life--</span>
<a name="l3460"><span class="ln">3460 </span></a><span class="s0">never looking so well.  Papa is only speaking his own regret.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3461"><span class="ln">3461 </span></a>
<a name="l3462"><span class="ln">3462 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very much to the honour of both,&quot; was the handsome reply.</span>
<a name="l3463"><span class="ln">3463 </span></a>
<a name="l3464"><span class="ln">3464 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?&quot; asked Isabella</span>
<a name="l3465"><span class="ln">3465 </span></a><span class="s0">in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.</span>
<a name="l3466"><span class="ln">3466 </span></a>
<a name="l3467"><span class="ln">3467 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--&quot;Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3468"><span class="ln">3468 </span></a>
<a name="l3469"><span class="ln">3469 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since</span>
<a name="l3470"><span class="ln">3470 </span></a><span class="s0">they married.  Either in the morning or evening of every day,</span>
<a name="l3471"><span class="ln">3471 </span></a><span class="s0">excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l3472"><span class="ln">3472 </span></a><span class="s0">and generally both, either at Randalls or here--and as you</span>
<a name="l3473"><span class="ln">3473 </span></a><span class="s0">may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here.  They are very,</span>
<a name="l3474"><span class="ln">3474 </span></a><span class="s0">very kind in their visits.  Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself.</span>
<a name="l3475"><span class="ln">3475 </span></a><span class="s0">Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving</span>
<a name="l3476"><span class="ln">3476 </span></a><span class="s0">Isabella a false idea of us all.  Every body must be aware that Miss</span>
<a name="l3477"><span class="ln">3477 </span></a><span class="s0">Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured</span>
<a name="l3478"><span class="ln">3478 </span></a><span class="s0">that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any</span>
<a name="l3479"><span class="ln">3479 </span></a><span class="s0">means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3480"><span class="ln">3480 </span></a>
<a name="l3481"><span class="ln">3481 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Just as it should be,&quot; said Mr. John Knightley, &quot;and just as I hoped</span>
<a name="l3482"><span class="ln">3482 </span></a><span class="s0">it was from your letters.  Her wish of shewing you attention could</span>
<a name="l3483"><span class="ln">3483 </span></a><span class="s0">not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it</span>
<a name="l3484"><span class="ln">3484 </span></a><span class="s0">all easy.  I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea</span>
<a name="l3485"><span class="ln">3485 </span></a><span class="s0">of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended;</span>
<a name="l3486"><span class="ln">3486 </span></a><span class="s0">and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3487"><span class="ln">3487 </span></a>
<a name="l3488"><span class="ln">3488 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Why, to be sure,&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse--&quot;yes, certainly--I cannot deny</span>
<a name="l3489"><span class="ln">3489 </span></a><span class="s0">that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often--</span>
<a name="l3490"><span class="ln">3490 </span></a><span class="s0">but then--she is always obliged to go away again.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3491"><span class="ln">3491 </span></a>
<a name="l3492"><span class="ln">3492 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--</span>
<a name="l3493"><span class="ln">3493 </span></a><span class="s0">You quite forget poor Mr. Weston.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3494"><span class="ln">3494 </span></a>
<a name="l3495"><span class="ln">3495 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I think, indeed,&quot; said John Knightley pleasantly, &quot;that Mr. Weston</span>
<a name="l3496"><span class="ln">3496 </span></a><span class="s0">has some little claim.  You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part</span>
<a name="l3497"><span class="ln">3497 </span></a><span class="s0">of the poor husband.  I, being a husband, and you not being a wife,</span>
<a name="l3498"><span class="ln">3498 </span></a><span class="s0">the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.</span>
<a name="l3499"><span class="ln">3499 </span></a><span class="s0">As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience</span>
<a name="l3500"><span class="ln">3500 </span></a><span class="s0">of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3501"><span class="ln">3501 </span></a>
<a name="l3502"><span class="ln">3502 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Me, my love,&quot; cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--</span>
<a name="l3503"><span class="ln">3503 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be,</span>
<a name="l3504"><span class="ln">3504 </span></a><span class="s0">a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been</span>
<a name="l3505"><span class="ln">3505 </span></a><span class="s0">for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought</span>
<a name="l3506"><span class="ln">3506 </span></a><span class="s0">of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;</span>
<a name="l3507"><span class="ln">3507 </span></a><span class="s0">and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think</span>
<a name="l3508"><span class="ln">3508 </span></a><span class="s0">there is nothing he does not deserve.  I believe he is one of the</span>
<a name="l3509"><span class="ln">3509 </span></a><span class="s0">very best-tempered men that ever existed.  Excepting yourself</span>
<a name="l3510"><span class="ln">3510 </span></a><span class="s0">and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper.  I shall</span>
<a name="l3511"><span class="ln">3511 </span></a><span class="s0">never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day</span>
<a name="l3512"><span class="ln">3512 </span></a><span class="s0">last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September</span>
<a name="l3513"><span class="ln">3513 </span></a><span class="s0">twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night,</span>
<a name="l3514"><span class="ln">3514 </span></a><span class="s0">on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham,</span>
<a name="l3515"><span class="ln">3515 </span></a><span class="s0">I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor</span>
<a name="l3516"><span class="ln">3516 </span></a><span class="s0">a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be</span>
<a name="l3517"><span class="ln">3517 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Taylor.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3518"><span class="ln">3518 </span></a>
<a name="l3519"><span class="ln">3519 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Where is the young man?&quot; said John Knightley.  &quot;Has he been here</span>
<a name="l3520"><span class="ln">3520 </span></a><span class="s0">on this occasion--or has he not?&quot;</span>
<a name="l3521"><span class="ln">3521 </span></a>
<a name="l3522"><span class="ln">3522 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He has not been here yet,&quot; replied Emma.  &quot;There was a strong</span>
<a name="l3523"><span class="ln">3523 </span></a><span class="s0">expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended</span>
<a name="l3524"><span class="ln">3524 </span></a><span class="s0">in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3525"><span class="ln">3525 </span></a>
<a name="l3526"><span class="ln">3526 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,&quot; said her father.</span>
<a name="l3527"><span class="ln">3527 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her,</span>
<a name="l3528"><span class="ln">3528 </span></a><span class="s0">and a very proper, handsome letter it was.  She shewed it to me.</span>
<a name="l3529"><span class="ln">3529 </span></a><span class="s0">I thought it very well done of him indeed.  Whether it was his own idea</span>
<a name="l3530"><span class="ln">3530 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, one cannot tell.  He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--&quot;</span>
<a name="l3531"><span class="ln">3531 </span></a>
<a name="l3532"><span class="ln">3532 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3533"><span class="ln">3533 </span></a>
<a name="l3534"><span class="ln">3534 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it--</span>
<a name="l3535"><span class="ln">3535 </span></a><span class="s0">and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!  Well,</span>
<a name="l3536"><span class="ln">3536 </span></a><span class="s0">time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad.  However, it was</span>
<a name="l3537"><span class="ln">3537 </span></a><span class="s0">an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l3538"><span class="ln">3538 </span></a><span class="s0">a great deal of pleasure.  I remember it was written from Weymouth,</span>
<a name="l3539"><span class="ln">3539 </span></a><span class="s0">and dated Sept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget</span>
<a name="l3540"><span class="ln">3540 </span></a><span class="s0">how it went on; and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'--</span>
<a name="l3541"><span class="ln">3541 </span></a><span class="s0">I remember that perfectly.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3542"><span class="ln">3542 </span></a>
<a name="l3543"><span class="ln">3543 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How very pleasing and proper of him!&quot; cried the good-hearted Mrs. John</span>
<a name="l3544"><span class="ln">3544 </span></a><span class="s0">Knightley.  &quot;I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man.</span>
<a name="l3545"><span class="ln">3545 </span></a><span class="s0">But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!</span>
<a name="l3546"><span class="ln">3546 </span></a><span class="s0">There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his</span>
<a name="l3547"><span class="ln">3547 </span></a><span class="s0">parents and natural home!  I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston</span>
<a name="l3548"><span class="ln">3548 </span></a><span class="s0">could part with him.  To give up one's child!  I really never</span>
<a name="l3549"><span class="ln">3549 </span></a><span class="s0">could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3550"><span class="ln">3550 </span></a>
<a name="l3551"><span class="ln">3551 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,&quot;</span>
<a name="l3552"><span class="ln">3552 </span></a><span class="s0">observed Mr. John Knightley coolly.  &quot;But you need not imagine</span>
<a name="l3553"><span class="ln">3553 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry</span>
<a name="l3554"><span class="ln">3554 </span></a><span class="s0">or John.  Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man,</span>
<a name="l3555"><span class="ln">3555 </span></a><span class="s0">than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them,</span>
<a name="l3556"><span class="ln">3556 </span></a><span class="s0">and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect,</span>
<a name="l3557"><span class="ln">3557 </span></a><span class="s0">much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is,</span>
<a name="l3558"><span class="ln">3558 </span></a><span class="s0">upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his</span>
<a name="l3559"><span class="ln">3559 </span></a><span class="s0">neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any</span>
<a name="l3560"><span class="ln">3560 </span></a><span class="s0">thing that home affords.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3561"><span class="ln">3561 </span></a>
<a name="l3562"><span class="ln">3562 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston,</span>
<a name="l3563"><span class="ln">3563 </span></a><span class="s0">and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let</span>
<a name="l3564"><span class="ln">3564 </span></a><span class="s0">it pass.  She would keep the peace if possible; and there was</span>
<a name="l3565"><span class="ln">3565 </span></a><span class="s0">something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits,</span>
<a name="l3566"><span class="ln">3566 </span></a><span class="s0">the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's</span>
<a name="l3567"><span class="ln">3567 </span></a><span class="s0">disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse,</span>
<a name="l3568"><span class="ln">3568 </span></a><span class="s0">and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.</span>
<a name="l3569"><span class="ln">3569 </span></a>
<a name="l3570"><span class="ln">3570 </span></a>

<a name="l3573"><span class="ln">3573 </span></a>
<a name="l3574"><span class="ln">3574 </span></a>
<a name="l3575"><span class="ln">3575 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination</span>
<a name="l3576"><span class="ln">3576 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him</span>
<a name="l3577"><span class="ln">3577 </span></a><span class="s0">in Isabella's first day.  Emma's sense of right however had decided it;</span>
<a name="l3578"><span class="ln">3578 </span></a><span class="s0">and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother,</span>
<a name="l3579"><span class="ln">3579 </span></a><span class="s0">she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late</span>
<a name="l3580"><span class="ln">3580 </span></a><span class="s0">disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him</span>
<a name="l3581"><span class="ln">3581 </span></a><span class="s0">the proper invitation.</span>
<a name="l3582"><span class="ln">3582 </span></a>
<a name="l3583"><span class="ln">3583 </span></a><span class="s0">She hoped they might now become friends again.  She thought it</span>
<a name="l3584"><span class="ln">3584 </span></a><span class="s0">was time to make up.  Making-up indeed would not do.  _She_ certainly</span>
<a name="l3585"><span class="ln">3585 </span></a><span class="s0">had not been in the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had.</span>
<a name="l3586"><span class="ln">3586 </span></a><span class="s0">Concession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear</span>
<a name="l3587"><span class="ln">3587 </span></a><span class="s0">to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather</span>
<a name="l3588"><span class="ln">3588 </span></a><span class="s0">assist the restoration of friendship, that when he came into the room</span>
<a name="l3589"><span class="ln">3589 </span></a><span class="s0">she had one of the children with her--the youngest, a nice little girl</span>
<a name="l3590"><span class="ln">3590 </span></a><span class="s0">about eight months old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l3591"><span class="ln">3591 </span></a><span class="s0">and very happy to be danced about in her aunt's arms.  It did assist;</span>
<a name="l3592"><span class="ln">3592 </span></a><span class="s0">for though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was soon</span>
<a name="l3593"><span class="ln">3593 </span></a><span class="s0">led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child</span>
<a name="l3594"><span class="ln">3594 </span></a><span class="s0">out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity.</span>
<a name="l3595"><span class="ln">3595 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving</span>
<a name="l3596"><span class="ln">3596 </span></a><span class="s0">her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness,</span>
<a name="l3597"><span class="ln">3597 </span></a><span class="s0">she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,</span>
<a name="l3598"><span class="ln">3598 </span></a>
<a name="l3599"><span class="ln">3599 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.</span>
<a name="l3600"><span class="ln">3600 </span></a><span class="s0">As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;</span>
<a name="l3601"><span class="ln">3601 </span></a><span class="s0">but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3602"><span class="ln">3602 </span></a>
<a name="l3603"><span class="ln">3603 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men</span>
<a name="l3604"><span class="ln">3604 </span></a><span class="s0">and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your</span>
<a name="l3605"><span class="ln">3605 </span></a><span class="s0">dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned,</span>
<a name="l3606"><span class="ln">3606 </span></a><span class="s0">we might always think alike.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3607"><span class="ln">3607 </span></a>
<a name="l3608"><span class="ln">3608 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being</span>
<a name="l3609"><span class="ln">3609 </span></a><span class="s0">in the wrong.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3610"><span class="ln">3610 </span></a>
<a name="l3611"><span class="ln">3611 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, smiling--&quot;and reason good.  I was sixteen years</span>
<a name="l3612"><span class="ln">3612 </span></a><span class="s0">old when you were born.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3613"><span class="ln">3613 </span></a>
<a name="l3614"><span class="ln">3614 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A material difference then,&quot; she replied--&quot;and no doubt you were</span>
<a name="l3615"><span class="ln">3615 </span></a><span class="s0">much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does</span>
<a name="l3616"><span class="ln">3616 </span></a><span class="s0">not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings</span>
<a name="l3617"><span class="ln">3617 </span></a><span class="s0">a good deal nearer?&quot;</span>
<a name="l3618"><span class="ln">3618 </span></a>
<a name="l3619"><span class="ln">3619 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes--a good deal _nearer_.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3620"><span class="ln">3620 </span></a>
<a name="l3621"><span class="ln">3621 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right,</span>
<a name="l3622"><span class="ln">3622 </span></a><span class="s0">if we think differently.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3623"><span class="ln">3623 </span></a>
<a name="l3624"><span class="ln">3624 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by</span>
<a name="l3625"><span class="ln">3625 </span></a><span class="s0">not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child.  Come, my dear Emma,</span>
<a name="l3626"><span class="ln">3626 </span></a><span class="s0">let us be friends, and say no more about it.  Tell your aunt, little Emma,</span>
<a name="l3627"><span class="ln">3627 </span></a><span class="s0">that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing</span>
<a name="l3628"><span class="ln">3628 </span></a><span class="s0">old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3629"><span class="ln">3629 </span></a>
<a name="l3630"><span class="ln">3630 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That's true,&quot; she cried--&quot;very true.  Little Emma, grow up</span>
<a name="l3631"><span class="ln">3631 </span></a><span class="s0">a better woman than your aunt.  Be infinitely cleverer and not</span>
<a name="l3632"><span class="ln">3632 </span></a><span class="s0">half so conceited.  Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I</span>
<a name="l3633"><span class="ln">3633 </span></a><span class="s0">have done.  As far as good intentions went, we were _both_ right,</span>
<a name="l3634"><span class="ln">3634 </span></a><span class="s0">and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet</span>
<a name="l3635"><span class="ln">3635 </span></a><span class="s0">proved wrong.  I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very,</span>
<a name="l3636"><span class="ln">3636 </span></a><span class="s0">very bitterly disappointed.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3637"><span class="ln">3637 </span></a>
<a name="l3638"><span class="ln">3638 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A man cannot be more so,&quot; was his short, full answer.</span>
<a name="l3639"><span class="ln">3639 </span></a>
<a name="l3640"><span class="ln">3640 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3641"><span class="ln">3641 </span></a>
<a name="l3642"><span class="ln">3642 </span></a><span class="s0">This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John</span>
<a name="l3643"><span class="ln">3643 </span></a><span class="s0">Knightley made his appearance, and &quot;How d'ye do, George?&quot; and &quot;John,</span>
<a name="l3644"><span class="ln">3644 </span></a><span class="s0">how are you?&quot; succeeded in the true English style, burying under</span>
<a name="l3645"><span class="ln">3645 </span></a><span class="s0">a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment</span>
<a name="l3646"><span class="ln">3646 </span></a><span class="s0">which would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing</span>
<a name="l3647"><span class="ln">3647 </span></a><span class="s0">for the good of the other.</span>
<a name="l3648"><span class="ln">3648 </span></a>
<a name="l3649"><span class="ln">3649 </span></a><span class="s0">The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined</span>
<a name="l3650"><span class="ln">3650 </span></a><span class="s0">cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his</span>
<a name="l3651"><span class="ln">3651 </span></a><span class="s0">dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions;</span>
<a name="l3652"><span class="ln">3652 </span></a><span class="s0">on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys;</span>
<a name="l3653"><span class="ln">3653 </span></a><span class="s0">their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma</span>
<a name="l3654"><span class="ln">3654 </span></a><span class="s0">only occasionally joining in one or the other.</span>
<a name="l3655"><span class="ln">3655 </span></a>
<a name="l3656"><span class="ln">3656 </span></a><span class="s0">The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally</span>
<a name="l3657"><span class="ln">3657 </span></a><span class="s0">of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,</span>
<a name="l3658"><span class="ln">3658 </span></a><span class="s0">and who was always the greater talker.  As a magistrate, he had</span>
<a name="l3659"><span class="ln">3659 </span></a><span class="s0">generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,</span>
<a name="l3660"><span class="ln">3660 </span></a><span class="s0">some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand</span>
<a name="l3661"><span class="ln">3661 </span></a><span class="s0">the home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear</span>
<a name="l3662"><span class="ln">3662 </span></a><span class="s0">next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail</span>
<a name="l3663"><span class="ln">3663 </span></a><span class="s0">of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been</span>
<a name="l3664"><span class="ln">3664 </span></a><span class="s0">the longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong.</span>
<a name="l3665"><span class="ln">3665 </span></a><span class="s0">The plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree,</span>
<a name="l3666"><span class="ln">3666 </span></a><span class="s0">and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn,</span>
<a name="l3667"><span class="ln">3667 </span></a><span class="s0">was entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his</span>
<a name="l3668"><span class="ln">3668 </span></a><span class="s0">cooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever</span>
<a name="l3669"><span class="ln">3669 </span></a><span class="s0">left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached</span>
<a name="l3670"><span class="ln">3670 </span></a><span class="s0">a tone of eagerness.</span>
<a name="l3671"><span class="ln">3671 </span></a>
<a name="l3672"><span class="ln">3672 </span></a><span class="s0">While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying</span>
<a name="l3673"><span class="ln">3673 </span></a><span class="s0">a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.</span>
<a name="l3674"><span class="ln">3674 </span></a>
<a name="l3675"><span class="ln">3675 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My poor dear Isabella,&quot; said he, fondly taking her hand,</span>
<a name="l3676"><span class="ln">3676 </span></a><span class="s0">and interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one</span>
<a name="l3677"><span class="ln">3677 </span></a><span class="s0">of her five children--&quot;How long it is, how terribly long since you</span>
<a name="l3678"><span class="ln">3678 </span></a><span class="s0">were here!  And how tired you must be after your journey!  You must</span>
<a name="l3679"><span class="ln">3679 </span></a><span class="s0">go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you</span>
<a name="l3680"><span class="ln">3680 </span></a><span class="s0">before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together.</span>
<a name="l3681"><span class="ln">3681 </span></a><span class="s0">My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3682"><span class="ln">3682 </span></a>
<a name="l3683"><span class="ln">3683 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did,</span>
<a name="l3684"><span class="ln">3684 </span></a><span class="s0">that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article</span>
<a name="l3685"><span class="ln">3685 </span></a><span class="s0">as herself;--and two basins only were ordered.  After a little</span>
<a name="l3686"><span class="ln">3686 </span></a><span class="s0">more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its</span>
<a name="l3687"><span class="ln">3687 </span></a><span class="s0">not being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say,</span>
<a name="l3688"><span class="ln">3688 </span></a><span class="s0">with an air of grave reflection,</span>
<a name="l3689"><span class="ln">3689 </span></a>
<a name="l3690"><span class="ln">3690 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn</span>
<a name="l3691"><span class="ln">3691 </span></a><span class="s0">at South End instead of coming here.  I never had much opinion</span>
<a name="l3692"><span class="ln">3692 </span></a><span class="s0">of the sea air.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3693"><span class="ln">3693 </span></a>
<a name="l3694"><span class="ln">3694 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we</span>
<a name="l3695"><span class="ln">3695 </span></a><span class="s0">should not have gone.  He recommended it for all the children,</span>
<a name="l3696"><span class="ln">3696 </span></a><span class="s0">but particularly for the weakness in little Bella's throat,--</span>
<a name="l3697"><span class="ln">3697 </span></a><span class="s0">both sea air and bathing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3698"><span class="ln">3698 </span></a>
<a name="l3699"><span class="ln">3699 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her</span>
<a name="l3700"><span class="ln">3700 </span></a><span class="s0">any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced,</span>
<a name="l3701"><span class="ln">3701 </span></a><span class="s0">though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very</span>
<a name="l3702"><span class="ln">3702 </span></a><span class="s0">rarely of use to any body.  I am sure it almost killed me once.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3703"><span class="ln">3703 </span></a>
<a name="l3704"><span class="ln">3704 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Come, come,&quot; cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, &quot;I must</span>
<a name="l3705"><span class="ln">3705 </span></a><span class="s0">beg you not to talk of the sea.  It makes me envious and miserable;--</span>
<a name="l3706"><span class="ln">3706 </span></a><span class="s0">I who have never seen it!  South End is prohibited, if you please.</span>
<a name="l3707"><span class="ln">3707 </span></a><span class="s0">My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about</span>
<a name="l3708"><span class="ln">3708 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3709"><span class="ln">3709 </span></a>
<a name="l3710"><span class="ln">3710 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?&quot;</span>
<a name="l3711"><span class="ln">3711 </span></a>
<a name="l3712"><span class="ln">3712 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Why, pretty well; but not quite well.  Poor Perry is bilious,</span>
<a name="l3713"><span class="ln">3713 </span></a><span class="s0">and he has not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has</span>
<a name="l3714"><span class="ln">3714 </span></a><span class="s0">not time to take care of himself--which is very sad--but he is</span>
<a name="l3715"><span class="ln">3715 </span></a><span class="s0">always wanted all round the country.  I suppose there is not a man</span>
<a name="l3716"><span class="ln">3716 </span></a><span class="s0">in such practice anywhere.  But then there is not so clever a man</span>
<a name="l3717"><span class="ln">3717 </span></a><span class="s0">any where.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3718"><span class="ln">3718 </span></a>
<a name="l3719"><span class="ln">3719 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?</span>
<a name="l3720"><span class="ln">3720 </span></a><span class="s0">I have a great regard for Mr. Perry.  I hope he will be calling soon.</span>
<a name="l3721"><span class="ln">3721 </span></a><span class="s0">He will be so pleased to see my little ones.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3722"><span class="ln">3722 </span></a>
<a name="l3723"><span class="ln">3723 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask</span>
<a name="l3724"><span class="ln">3724 </span></a><span class="s0">him about myself of some consequence.  And, my dear, whenever he comes,</span>
<a name="l3725"><span class="ln">3725 </span></a><span class="s0">you had better let him look at little Bella's throat.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3726"><span class="ln">3726 </span></a>
<a name="l3727"><span class="ln">3727 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly</span>
<a name="l3728"><span class="ln">3728 </span></a><span class="s0">any uneasiness about it.  Either bathing has been of the greatest</span>
<a name="l3729"><span class="ln">3729 </span></a><span class="s0">service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent</span>
<a name="l3730"><span class="ln">3730 </span></a><span class="s0">embrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been applying</span>
<a name="l3731"><span class="ln">3731 </span></a><span class="s0">at times ever since August.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3732"><span class="ln">3732 </span></a>
<a name="l3733"><span class="ln">3733 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been</span>
<a name="l3734"><span class="ln">3734 </span></a><span class="s0">of use to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation,</span>
<a name="l3735"><span class="ln">3735 </span></a><span class="s0">I would have spoken to--</span>
<a name="l3736"><span class="ln">3736 </span></a>
<a name="l3737"><span class="ln">3737 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,&quot; said Emma,</span>
<a name="l3738"><span class="ln">3738 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have not heard one inquiry after them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3739"><span class="ln">3739 </span></a>
<a name="l3740"><span class="ln">3740 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you</span>
<a name="l3741"><span class="ln">3741 </span></a><span class="s0">mention them in most of your letters.  I hope they are quite well.</span>
<a name="l3742"><span class="ln">3742 </span></a><span class="s0">Good old Mrs. Bates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take</span>
<a name="l3743"><span class="ln">3743 </span></a><span class="s0">my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.--</span>
<a name="l3744"><span class="ln">3744 </span></a><span class="s0">And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!--</span>
<a name="l3745"><span class="ln">3745 </span></a><span class="s0">How are they, sir?&quot;</span>
<a name="l3746"><span class="ln">3746 </span></a>
<a name="l3747"><span class="ln">3747 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole.  But poor Mrs. Bates</span>
<a name="l3748"><span class="ln">3748 </span></a><span class="s0">had a bad cold about a month ago.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3749"><span class="ln">3749 </span></a>
<a name="l3750"><span class="ln">3750 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How sorry I am!  But colds were never so prevalent as they have been</span>
<a name="l3751"><span class="ln">3751 </span></a><span class="s0">this autumn.  Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them</span>
<a name="l3752"><span class="ln">3752 </span></a><span class="s0">more general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3753"><span class="ln">3753 </span></a>
<a name="l3754"><span class="ln">3754 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree</span>
<a name="l3755"><span class="ln">3755 </span></a><span class="s0">you mention.  Perry says that colds have been very general,</span>
<a name="l3756"><span class="ln">3756 </span></a><span class="s0">but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November.</span>
<a name="l3757"><span class="ln">3757 </span></a><span class="s0">Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3758"><span class="ln">3758 </span></a>
<a name="l3759"><span class="ln">3759 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except--</span>
<a name="l3760"><span class="ln">3760 </span></a>
<a name="l3761"><span class="ln">3761 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always</span>
<a name="l3762"><span class="ln">3762 </span></a><span class="s0">a sickly season.  Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be.</span>
<a name="l3763"><span class="ln">3763 </span></a><span class="s0">It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--</span>
<a name="l3764"><span class="ln">3764 </span></a><span class="s0">and the air so bad!&quot;</span>
<a name="l3765"><span class="ln">3765 </span></a>
<a name="l3766"><span class="ln">3766 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air.  Our part of London is</span>
<a name="l3767"><span class="ln">3767 </span></a><span class="s0">very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London</span>
<a name="l3768"><span class="ln">3768 </span></a><span class="s0">in general, my dear sir.  The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square</span>
<a name="l3769"><span class="ln">3769 </span></a><span class="s0">is very different from almost all the rest.  We are so very airy!</span>
<a name="l3770"><span class="ln">3770 </span></a><span class="s0">I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--</span>
<a name="l3771"><span class="ln">3771 </span></a><span class="s0">there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my</span>
<a name="l3772"><span class="ln">3772 </span></a><span class="s0">children in:  but _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks</span>
<a name="l3773"><span class="ln">3773 </span></a><span class="s0">the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as</span>
<a name="l3774"><span class="ln">3774 </span></a><span class="s0">to air.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3775"><span class="ln">3775 </span></a>
<a name="l3776"><span class="ln">3776 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield.  You make the best of it--</span>
<a name="l3777"><span class="ln">3777 </span></a><span class="s0">but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you</span>
<a name="l3778"><span class="ln">3778 </span></a><span class="s0">different creatures; you do not look like the same.  Now I cannot say,</span>
<a name="l3779"><span class="ln">3779 </span></a><span class="s0">that I think you are any of you looking well at present.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3780"><span class="ln">3780 </span></a>
<a name="l3781"><span class="ln">3781 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those</span>
<a name="l3782"><span class="ln">3782 </span></a><span class="s0">little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely</span>
<a name="l3783"><span class="ln">3783 </span></a><span class="s0">free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were</span>
<a name="l3784"><span class="ln">3784 </span></a><span class="s0">rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were</span>
<a name="l3785"><span class="ln">3785 </span></a><span class="s0">a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness</span>
<a name="l3786"><span class="ln">3786 </span></a><span class="s0">of coming.  I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow;</span>
<a name="l3787"><span class="ln">3787 </span></a><span class="s0">for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe</span>
<a name="l3788"><span class="ln">3788 </span></a><span class="s0">he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case.  I trust,</span>
<a name="l3789"><span class="ln">3789 </span></a><span class="s0">at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,&quot;</span>
<a name="l3790"><span class="ln">3790 </span></a><span class="s0">turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.</span>
<a name="l3791"><span class="ln">3791 </span></a>
<a name="l3792"><span class="ln">3792 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you.  I think Mr. John</span>
<a name="l3793"><span class="ln">3793 </span></a><span class="s0">Knightley very far from looking well.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3794"><span class="ln">3794 </span></a>
<a name="l3795"><span class="ln">3795 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?&quot; cried Mr. John</span>
<a name="l3796"><span class="ln">3796 </span></a><span class="s0">Knightley, hearing his own name.</span>
<a name="l3797"><span class="ln">3797 </span></a>
<a name="l3798"><span class="ln">3798 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you</span>
<a name="l3799"><span class="ln">3799 </span></a><span class="s0">looking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued.</span>
<a name="l3800"><span class="ln">3800 </span></a><span class="s0">I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen</span>
<a name="l3801"><span class="ln">3801 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Wingfield before you left home.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3802"><span class="ln">3802 </span></a>
<a name="l3803"><span class="ln">3803 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Isabella,&quot;--exclaimed he hastily--&quot;pray do not concern</span>
<a name="l3804"><span class="ln">3804 </span></a><span class="s0">yourself about my looks.  Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling</span>
<a name="l3805"><span class="ln">3805 </span></a><span class="s0">yourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3806"><span class="ln">3806 </span></a>
<a name="l3807"><span class="ln">3807 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,&quot;</span>
<a name="l3808"><span class="ln">3808 </span></a><span class="s0">cried Emma, &quot;about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff</span>
<a name="l3809"><span class="ln">3809 </span></a><span class="s0">from Scotland, to look after his new estate.  What will it answer?</span>
<a name="l3810"><span class="ln">3810 </span></a><span class="s0">Will not the old prejudice be too strong?&quot;</span>
<a name="l3811"><span class="ln">3811 </span></a>
<a name="l3812"><span class="ln">3812 </span></a><span class="s0">And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced</span>
<a name="l3813"><span class="ln">3813 </span></a><span class="s0">to give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing</span>
<a name="l3814"><span class="ln">3814 </span></a><span class="s0">worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax;</span>
<a name="l3815"><span class="ln">3815 </span></a><span class="s0">and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general,</span>
<a name="l3816"><span class="ln">3816 </span></a><span class="s0">she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising.</span>
<a name="l3817"><span class="ln">3817 </span></a>
<a name="l3818"><span class="ln">3818 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!&quot; said Mrs. John Knightley.--</span>
<a name="l3819"><span class="ln">3819 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment</span>
<a name="l3820"><span class="ln">3820 </span></a><span class="s0">accidentally in town!  What happiness it must be to her good old</span>
<a name="l3821"><span class="ln">3821 </span></a><span class="s0">grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them!</span>
<a name="l3822"><span class="ln">3822 </span></a><span class="s0">I always regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot</span>
<a name="l3823"><span class="ln">3823 </span></a><span class="s0">be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose</span>
<a name="l3824"><span class="ln">3824 </span></a><span class="s0">Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all.</span>
<a name="l3825"><span class="ln">3825 </span></a><span class="s0">She would be such a delightful companion for Emma.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3826"><span class="ln">3826 </span></a>
<a name="l3827"><span class="ln">3827 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,</span>
<a name="l3828"><span class="ln">3828 </span></a>
<a name="l3829"><span class="ln">3829 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another</span>
<a name="l3830"><span class="ln">3830 </span></a><span class="s0">pretty kind of young person.  You will like Harriet.  Emma could</span>
<a name="l3831"><span class="ln">3831 </span></a><span class="s0">not have a better companion than Harriet.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3832"><span class="ln">3832 </span></a>
<a name="l3833"><span class="ln">3833 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be</span>
<a name="l3834"><span class="ln">3834 </span></a><span class="s0">so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3835"><span class="ln">3835 </span></a>
<a name="l3836"><span class="ln">3836 </span></a><span class="s0">This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of</span>
<a name="l3837"><span class="ln">3837 </span></a><span class="s0">similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening</span>
<a name="l3838"><span class="ln">3838 </span></a><span class="s0">did not close without a little return of agitation.  The gruel came</span>
<a name="l3839"><span class="ln">3839 </span></a><span class="s0">and supplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--</span>
<a name="l3840"><span class="ln">3840 </span></a><span class="s0">undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution,</span>
<a name="l3841"><span class="ln">3841 </span></a><span class="s0">and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was</span>
<a name="l3842"><span class="ln">3842 </span></a><span class="s0">never met with tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures</span>
<a name="l3843"><span class="ln">3843 </span></a><span class="s0">which the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore</span>
<a name="l3844"><span class="ln">3844 </span></a><span class="s0">most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman</span>
<a name="l3845"><span class="ln">3845 </span></a><span class="s0">hired for the time, who never had been able to understand what she</span>
<a name="l3846"><span class="ln">3846 </span></a><span class="s0">meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin.</span>
<a name="l3847"><span class="ln">3847 </span></a><span class="s0">Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been able</span>
<a name="l3848"><span class="ln">3848 </span></a><span class="s0">to get any thing tolerable.  Here was a dangerous opening.</span>
<a name="l3849"><span class="ln">3849 </span></a>
<a name="l3850"><span class="ln">3850 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on</span>
<a name="l3851"><span class="ln">3851 </span></a><span class="s0">her with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed,</span>
<a name="l3852"><span class="ln">3852 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to</span>
<a name="l3853"><span class="ln">3853 </span></a><span class="s0">South End.  It does not bear talking of.&quot;  And for a little while</span>
<a name="l3854"><span class="ln">3854 </span></a><span class="s0">she hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent rumination</span>
<a name="l3855"><span class="ln">3855 </span></a><span class="s0">might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel.</span>
<a name="l3856"><span class="ln">3856 </span></a><span class="s0">After an interval of some minutes, however, he began with,</span>
<a name="l3857"><span class="ln">3857 </span></a>
<a name="l3858"><span class="ln">3858 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,</span>
<a name="l3859"><span class="ln">3859 </span></a><span class="s0">instead of coming here.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3860"><span class="ln">3860 </span></a>
<a name="l3861"><span class="ln">3861 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children</span>
<a name="l3862"><span class="ln">3862 </span></a><span class="s0">a great deal of good.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3863"><span class="ln">3863 </span></a>
<a name="l3864"><span class="ln">3864 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not</span>
<a name="l3865"><span class="ln">3865 </span></a><span class="s0">have been to South End.  South End is an unhealthy place.</span>
<a name="l3866"><span class="ln">3866 </span></a><span class="s0">Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3867"><span class="ln">3867 </span></a>
<a name="l3868"><span class="ln">3868 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is</span>
<a name="l3869"><span class="ln">3869 </span></a><span class="s0">quite a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there,</span>
<a name="l3870"><span class="ln">3870 </span></a><span class="s0">never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield</span>
<a name="l3871"><span class="ln">3871 </span></a><span class="s0">says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy;</span>
<a name="l3872"><span class="ln">3872 </span></a><span class="s0">and I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands</span>
<a name="l3873"><span class="ln">3873 </span></a><span class="s0">the nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been</span>
<a name="l3874"><span class="ln">3874 </span></a><span class="s0">there repeatedly.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3875"><span class="ln">3875 </span></a>
<a name="l3876"><span class="ln">3876 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--</span>
<a name="l3877"><span class="ln">3877 </span></a><span class="s0">Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best</span>
<a name="l3878"><span class="ln">3878 </span></a><span class="s0">of all the sea-bathing places.  A fine open sea, he says, and very</span>
<a name="l3879"><span class="ln">3879 </span></a><span class="s0">pure air.  And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there</span>
<a name="l3880"><span class="ln">3880 </span></a><span class="s0">quite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable.</span>
<a name="l3881"><span class="ln">3881 </span></a><span class="s0">You should have consulted Perry.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3882"><span class="ln">3882 </span></a>
<a name="l3883"><span class="ln">3883 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how</span>
<a name="l3884"><span class="ln">3884 </span></a><span class="s0">great it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3885"><span class="ln">3885 </span></a>
<a name="l3886"><span class="ln">3886 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else</span>
<a name="l3887"><span class="ln">3887 </span></a><span class="s0">should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much</span>
<a name="l3888"><span class="ln">3888 </span></a><span class="s0">to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,</span>
<a name="l3889"><span class="ln">3889 </span></a><span class="s0">better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get</span>
<a name="l3890"><span class="ln">3890 </span></a><span class="s0">into a worse air.  This is just what Perry said.  It seemed to him</span>
<a name="l3891"><span class="ln">3891 </span></a><span class="s0">a very ill-judged measure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3892"><span class="ln">3892 </span></a>
<a name="l3893"><span class="ln">3893 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he</span>
<a name="l3894"><span class="ln">3894 </span></a><span class="s0">had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her</span>
<a name="l3895"><span class="ln">3895 </span></a><span class="s0">brother-in-law's breaking out.</span>
<a name="l3896"><span class="ln">3896 </span></a>
<a name="l3897"><span class="ln">3897 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Perry,&quot; said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure,</span>
<a name="l3898"><span class="ln">3898 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for.</span>
<a name="l3899"><span class="ln">3899 </span></a><span class="s0">Why does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?--</span>
<a name="l3900"><span class="ln">3900 </span></a><span class="s0">at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may</span>
<a name="l3901"><span class="ln">3901 </span></a><span class="s0">be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--</span>
<a name="l3902"><span class="ln">3902 </span></a><span class="s0">I want his directions no more than his drugs.&quot;  He paused--</span>
<a name="l3903"><span class="ln">3903 </span></a><span class="s0">and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness,</span>
<a name="l3904"><span class="ln">3904 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children</span>
<a name="l3905"><span class="ln">3905 </span></a><span class="s0">a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense</span>
<a name="l3906"><span class="ln">3906 </span></a><span class="s0">or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to</span>
<a name="l3907"><span class="ln">3907 </span></a><span class="s0">prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3908"><span class="ln">3908 </span></a>
<a name="l3909"><span class="ln">3909 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;True, true,&quot; cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--</span>
<a name="l3910"><span class="ln">3910 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;very true.  That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I</span>
<a name="l3911"><span class="ln">3911 </span></a><span class="s0">was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning</span>
<a name="l3912"><span class="ln">3912 </span></a><span class="s0">it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows,</span>
<a name="l3913"><span class="ln">3913 </span></a><span class="s0">I cannot conceive any difficulty.  I should not attempt it,</span>
<a name="l3914"><span class="ln">3914 </span></a><span class="s0">if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people,</span>
<a name="l3915"><span class="ln">3915 </span></a><span class="s0">but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path. . . .</span>
<a name="l3916"><span class="ln">3916 </span></a><span class="s0">The only way of proving it, however, will be to turn to our maps.</span>
<a name="l3917"><span class="ln">3917 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we</span>
<a name="l3918"><span class="ln">3918 </span></a><span class="s0">will look them over, and you shall give me your opinion.&quot;</span>
<a name="l3919"><span class="ln">3919 </span></a>
<a name="l3920"><span class="ln">3920 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on</span>
<a name="l3921"><span class="ln">3921 </span></a><span class="s0">his friend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously,</span>
<a name="l3922"><span class="ln">3922 </span></a><span class="s0">been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--</span>
<a name="l3923"><span class="ln">3923 </span></a><span class="s0">but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed</span>
<a name="l3924"><span class="ln">3924 </span></a><span class="s0">the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother,</span>
<a name="l3925"><span class="ln">3925 </span></a><span class="s0">and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.</span>
<a name="l3926"><span class="ln">3926 </span></a>

<a name="l3932"><span class="ln">3932 </span></a><span class="s0">There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John</span>
<a name="l3933"><span class="ln">3933 </span></a><span class="s0">Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning</span>
<a name="l3934"><span class="ln">3934 </span></a><span class="s0">among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking</span>
<a name="l3935"><span class="ln">3935 </span></a><span class="s0">over what she had done every evening with her father and sister.</span>
<a name="l3936"><span class="ln">3936 </span></a><span class="s0">She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass</span>
<a name="l3937"><span class="ln">3937 </span></a><span class="s0">so swiftly.  It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.</span>
<a name="l3938"><span class="ln">3938 </span></a>
<a name="l3939"><span class="ln">3939 </span></a><span class="s0">In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than</span>
<a name="l3940"><span class="ln">3940 </span></a><span class="s0">their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out</span>
<a name="l3941"><span class="ln">3941 </span></a><span class="s0">of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas.</span>
<a name="l3942"><span class="ln">3942 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls</span>
<a name="l3943"><span class="ln">3943 </span></a><span class="s0">one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible</span>
<a name="l3944"><span class="ln">3944 </span></a><span class="s0">thing in preference to a division of the party.</span>

<a name="l3946"><span class="ln">3946 </span></a><span class="s0">How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty</span>
<a name="l3947"><span class="ln">3947 </span></a><span class="s0">if he could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses</span>
<a name="l3948"><span class="ln">3948 </span></a><span class="s0">were actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than</span>
<a name="l3949"><span class="ln">3949 </span></a><span class="s0">a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt;</span>
<a name="l3950"><span class="ln">3950 </span></a><span class="s0">nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one</span>
<a name="l3951"><span class="ln">3951 </span></a><span class="s0">of the carriages find room for Harriet also.</span>
<a name="l3952"><span class="ln">3952 </span></a>
<a name="l3953"><span class="ln">3953 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set,</span>
<a name="l3954"><span class="ln">3954 </span></a><span class="s0">were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early,</span>
<a name="l3955"><span class="ln">3955 </span></a><span class="s0">as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination</span>
<a name="l3956"><span class="ln">3956 </span></a><span class="s0">being consulted in every thing.</span>
<a name="l3957"><span class="ln">3957 </span></a>
<a name="l3958"><span class="ln">3958 </span></a><span class="s0">The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event</span>
<a name="l3959"><span class="ln">3959 </span></a><span class="s0">that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been</span>
<a name="l3960"><span class="ln">3960 </span></a><span class="s0">spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed</span>
<a name="l3961"><span class="ln">3961 </span></a><span class="s0">with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed</span>
<a name="l3962"><span class="ln">3962 </span></a><span class="s0">by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house.</span>
<a name="l3963"><span class="ln">3963 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed</span>
<a name="l3964"><span class="ln">3964 </span></a><span class="s0">with regard to Randalls.  She was very feverish and had a bad</span>
<a name="l3965"><span class="ln">3965 </span></a><span class="s0">sore throat:  Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry</span>
<a name="l3966"><span class="ln">3966 </span></a><span class="s0">was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist</span>
<a name="l3967"><span class="ln">3967 </span></a><span class="s0">the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement,</span>
<a name="l3968"><span class="ln">3968 </span></a><span class="s0">though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.</span>
<a name="l3969"><span class="ln">3969 </span></a>
<a name="l3970"><span class="ln">3970 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's</span>
<a name="l3971"><span class="ln">3971 </span></a><span class="s0">unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much</span>
<a name="l3972"><span class="ln">3972 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her</span>
<a name="l3973"><span class="ln">3973 </span></a><span class="s0">at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having</span>
<a name="l3974"><span class="ln">3974 </span></a><span class="s0">a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much.</span>
<a name="l3975"><span class="ln">3975 </span></a><span class="s0">She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she</span>
<a name="l3976"><span class="ln">3976 </span></a><span class="s0">was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as</span>
<a name="l3977"><span class="ln">3977 </span></a><span class="s0">they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid--</span>
<a name="l3978"><span class="ln">3978 </span></a><span class="s0">of whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going</span>
<a name="l3979"><span class="ln">3979 </span></a><span class="s0">to inquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield--</span>
<a name="l3980"><span class="ln">3980 </span></a><span class="s0">they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the</span>
<a name="l3981"><span class="ln">3981 </span></a><span class="s0">daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy,</span>
<a name="l3982"><span class="ln">3982 </span></a><span class="s0">glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed</span>
<a name="l3983"><span class="ln">3983 </span></a><span class="s0">to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they</span>
<a name="l3984"><span class="ln">3984 </span></a><span class="s0">were hastening home for.  They joined company and proceeded together.</span>
<a name="l3985"><span class="ln">3985 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's complaint;--</span>
<a name="l3986"><span class="ln">3986 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her,</span>
<a name="l3987"><span class="ln">3987 </span></a><span class="s0">a quick, low pulse, &amp;c.  and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard</span>
<a name="l3988"><span class="ln">3988 </span></a><span class="s0">that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often</span>
<a name="l3989"><span class="ln">3989 </span></a><span class="s0">alarmed her with them.&quot;  Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion,</span>
<a name="l3990"><span class="ln">3990 </span></a><span class="s0">as he exclaimed,</span>
<a name="l3991"><span class="ln">3991 </span></a>
<a name="l3992"><span class="ln">3992 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious.  I hope not of a putrid</span>
<a name="l3993"><span class="ln">3993 </span></a><span class="s0">infectious sort.  Has Perry seen her?  Indeed you should take care</span>
<a name="l3994"><span class="ln">3994 </span></a><span class="s0">of yourself as well as of your friend.  Let me entreat you to run</span>
<a name="l3995"><span class="ln">3995 </span></a><span class="s0">no risks.  Why does not Perry see her?&quot;</span>
<a name="l3996"><span class="ln">3996 </span></a>
<a name="l3997"><span class="ln">3997 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this</span>
<a name="l3998"><span class="ln">3998 </span></a><span class="s0">excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience</span>
<a name="l3999"><span class="ln">3999 </span></a><span class="s0">and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness</span>
<a name="l4000"><span class="ln">4000 </span></a><span class="s0">which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather</span>
<a name="l4001"><span class="ln">4001 </span></a><span class="s0">feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite</span>
<a name="l4002"><span class="ln">4002 </span></a><span class="s0">another subject,</span>
<a name="l4003"><span class="ln">4003 </span></a>
<a name="l4004"><span class="ln">4004 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much</span>
<a name="l4005"><span class="ln">4005 </span></a><span class="s0">like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party,</span>
<a name="l4006"><span class="ln">4006 </span></a><span class="s0">I should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father</span>
<a name="l4007"><span class="ln">4007 </span></a><span class="s0">from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem</span>
<a name="l4008"><span class="ln">4008 </span></a><span class="s0">to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it</span>
<a name="l4009"><span class="ln">4009 </span></a><span class="s0">would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.  But, upon</span>
<a name="l4010"><span class="ln">4010 </span></a><span class="s0">my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself.</span>
<a name="l4011"><span class="ln">4011 </span></a><span class="s0">You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider</span>
<a name="l4012"><span class="ln">4012 </span></a><span class="s0">what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring,</span>
<a name="l4013"><span class="ln">4013 </span></a><span class="s0">I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home</span>
<a name="l4014"><span class="ln">4014 </span></a><span class="s0">and take care of yourself to-night.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4015"><span class="ln">4015 </span></a>
<a name="l4016"><span class="ln">4016 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;</span>
<a name="l4017"><span class="ln">4017 </span></a><span class="s0">which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind</span>
<a name="l4018"><span class="ln">4018 </span></a><span class="s0">care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of</span>
<a name="l4019"><span class="ln">4019 </span></a><span class="s0">her's, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--</span>
<a name="l4020"><span class="ln">4020 </span></a><span class="s0">but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions</span>
<a name="l4021"><span class="ln">4021 </span></a><span class="s0">and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision,</span>
<a name="l4022"><span class="ln">4022 </span></a><span class="s0">was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its</span>
<a name="l4023"><span class="ln">4023 </span></a><span class="s0">being &quot;very cold, certainly very cold,&quot; and walked on, rejoicing in</span>
<a name="l4024"><span class="ln">4024 </span></a><span class="s0">having extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power</span>
<a name="l4025"><span class="ln">4025 </span></a><span class="s0">of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening.</span>
<a name="l4026"><span class="ln">4026 </span></a>
<a name="l4027"><span class="ln">4027 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You do quite right,&quot; said she;--&quot;we will make your apologies</span>
<a name="l4028"><span class="ln">4028 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4029"><span class="ln">4029 </span></a>
<a name="l4030"><span class="ln">4030 </span></a><span class="s0">But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly</span>
<a name="l4031"><span class="ln">4031 </span></a><span class="s0">offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's</span>
<a name="l4032"><span class="ln">4032 </span></a><span class="s0">only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much</span>
<a name="l4033"><span class="ln">4033 </span></a><span class="s0">prompt satisfaction.  It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go,</span>
<a name="l4034"><span class="ln">4034 </span></a><span class="s0">and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than</span>
<a name="l4035"><span class="ln">4035 </span></a><span class="s0">at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes</span>
<a name="l4036"><span class="ln">4036 </span></a><span class="s0">more exulting than when he next looked at her.</span>
<a name="l4037"><span class="ln">4037 </span></a>
<a name="l4038"><span class="ln">4038 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said she to herself, &quot;this is most strange!--After I</span>
<a name="l4039"><span class="ln">4039 </span></a><span class="s0">had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave</span>
<a name="l4040"><span class="ln">4040 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe,</span>
<a name="l4041"><span class="ln">4041 </span></a><span class="s0">in many men, especially single men, such an inclination--</span>
<a name="l4042"><span class="ln">4042 </span></a><span class="s0">such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement is so high in</span>
<a name="l4043"><span class="ln">4043 </span></a><span class="s0">the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities,</span>
<a name="l4044"><span class="ln">4044 </span></a><span class="s0">almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must</span>
<a name="l4045"><span class="ln">4045 </span></a><span class="s0">be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young</span>
<a name="l4046"><span class="ln">4046 </span></a><span class="s0">man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still,</span>
<a name="l4047"><span class="ln">4047 </span></a><span class="s0">he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked.</span>
<a name="l4048"><span class="ln">4048 </span></a><span class="s0">What a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in Harriet,</span>
<a name="l4049"><span class="ln">4049 </span></a><span class="s0">but will not dine alone for her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4050"><span class="ln">4050 </span></a>
<a name="l4051"><span class="ln">4051 </span></a><span class="s0">Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him</span>
<a name="l4052"><span class="ln">4052 </span></a><span class="s0">the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment</span>
<a name="l4053"><span class="ln">4053 </span></a><span class="s0">in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his</span>
<a name="l4054"><span class="ln">4054 </span></a><span class="s0">voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's</span>
<a name="l4055"><span class="ln">4055 </span></a><span class="s0">for news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared</span>
<a name="l4056"><span class="ln">4056 </span></a><span class="s0">for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be</span>
<a name="l4057"><span class="ln">4057 </span></a><span class="s0">able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself</span>
<a name="l4058"><span class="ln">4058 </span></a><span class="s0">off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour.</span>
<a name="l4059"><span class="ln">4059 </span></a>
<a name="l4060"><span class="ln">4060 </span></a><span class="s0">After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley</span>
<a name="l4061"><span class="ln">4061 </span></a><span class="s0">began with--</span>
<a name="l4062"><span class="ln">4062 </span></a>
<a name="l4063"><span class="ln">4063 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than</span>
<a name="l4064"><span class="ln">4064 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton.  It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.</span>
<a name="l4065"><span class="ln">4065 </span></a><span class="s0">With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies</span>
<a name="l4066"><span class="ln">4066 </span></a><span class="s0">to please, every feature works.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4067"><span class="ln">4067 </span></a>
<a name="l4068"><span class="ln">4068 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,&quot; replied Emma; &quot;but where there</span>
<a name="l4069"><span class="ln">4069 </span></a><span class="s0">is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook</span>
<a name="l4070"><span class="ln">4070 </span></a><span class="s0">a great deal.  Where a man does his best with only moderate powers,</span>
<a name="l4071"><span class="ln">4071 </span></a><span class="s0">he will have the advantage over negligent superiority.  There is</span>
<a name="l4072"><span class="ln">4072 </span></a><span class="s0">such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot</span>
<a name="l4073"><span class="ln">4073 </span></a><span class="s0">but value.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4074"><span class="ln">4074 </span></a>
<a name="l4075"><span class="ln">4075 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness,</span>
<a name="l4076"><span class="ln">4076 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4077"><span class="ln">4077 </span></a>
<a name="l4078"><span class="ln">4078 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Me!&quot; she replied with a smile of astonishment, &quot;are you imagining</span>
<a name="l4079"><span class="ln">4079 </span></a><span class="s0">me to be Mr. Elton's object?&quot;</span>
<a name="l4080"><span class="ln">4080 </span></a>
<a name="l4081"><span class="ln">4081 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never</span>
<a name="l4082"><span class="ln">4082 </span></a><span class="s0">occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4083"><span class="ln">4083 </span></a>
<a name="l4084"><span class="ln">4084 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!&quot;</span>
<a name="l4085"><span class="ln">4085 </span></a>
<a name="l4086"><span class="ln">4086 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether</span>
<a name="l4087"><span class="ln">4087 </span></a><span class="s0">it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.</span>
<a name="l4088"><span class="ln">4088 </span></a><span class="s0">I think your manners to him encouraging.  I speak as a friend,</span>
<a name="l4089"><span class="ln">4089 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma.  You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do,</span>
<a name="l4090"><span class="ln">4090 </span></a><span class="s0">and what you mean to do.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4091"><span class="ln">4091 </span></a>
<a name="l4092"><span class="ln">4092 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.  Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l4093"><span class="ln">4093 </span></a><span class="s0">and I are very good friends, and nothing more;&quot; and she walked on,</span>
<a name="l4094"><span class="ln">4094 </span></a><span class="s0">amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often</span>
<a name="l4095"><span class="ln">4095 </span></a><span class="s0">arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes</span>
<a name="l4096"><span class="ln">4096 </span></a><span class="s0">which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into;</span>
<a name="l4097"><span class="ln">4097 </span></a><span class="s0">and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind</span>
<a name="l4098"><span class="ln">4098 </span></a><span class="s0">and ignorant, and in want of counsel.  He said no more.</span>
<a name="l4099"><span class="ln">4099 </span></a>
<a name="l4100"><span class="ln">4100 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,</span>
<a name="l4101"><span class="ln">4101 </span></a><span class="s0">that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea</span>
<a name="l4102"><span class="ln">4102 </span></a><span class="s0">of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually</span>
<a name="l4103"><span class="ln">4103 </span></a><span class="s0">with his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent</span>
<a name="l4104"><span class="ln">4104 </span></a><span class="s0">consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full</span>
<a name="l4105"><span class="ln">4105 </span></a><span class="s0">of the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at</span>
<a name="l4106"><span class="ln">4106 </span></a><span class="s0">Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.</span>
<a name="l4107"><span class="ln">4107 </span></a><span class="s0">The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage</span>
<a name="l4108"><span class="ln">4108 </span></a><span class="s0">was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,</span>
<a name="l4109"><span class="ln">4109 </span></a><span class="s0">and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only</span>
<a name="l4110"><span class="ln">4110 </span></a><span class="s0">a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.</span>
<a name="l4111"><span class="ln">4111 </span></a>
<a name="l4112"><span class="ln">4112 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.</span>
<a name="l4113"><span class="ln">4113 </span></a><span class="s0">The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice</span>
<a name="l4114"><span class="ln">4114 </span></a><span class="s0">of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,</span>
<a name="l4115"><span class="ln">4115 </span></a><span class="s0">which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated</span>
<a name="l4116"><span class="ln">4116 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase;</span>
<a name="l4117"><span class="ln">4117 </span></a><span class="s0">and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in</span>
<a name="l4118"><span class="ln">4118 </span></a><span class="s0">expressing his discontent.</span>
<a name="l4119"><span class="ln">4119 </span></a>
<a name="l4120"><span class="ln">4120 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A man,&quot; said he, &quot;must have a very good opinion of himself when</span>
<a name="l4121"><span class="ln">4121 </span></a><span class="s0">he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such</span>
<a name="l4122"><span class="ln">4122 </span></a><span class="s0">a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him.  He must think</span>
<a name="l4123"><span class="ln">4123 </span></a><span class="s0">himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing.</span>
<a name="l4124"><span class="ln">4124 </span></a><span class="s0">It is the greatest absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--</span>
<a name="l4125"><span class="ln">4125 </span></a><span class="s0">The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home--and the</span>
<a name="l4126"><span class="ln">4126 </span></a><span class="s0">folly of people's not staying comfortably at home when they can!</span>
<a name="l4127"><span class="ln">4127 </span></a><span class="s0">If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of</span>
<a name="l4128"><span class="ln">4128 </span></a><span class="s0">duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we,</span>
<a name="l4129"><span class="ln">4129 </span></a><span class="s0">probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward</span>
<a name="l4130"><span class="ln">4130 </span></a><span class="s0">voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature,</span>
<a name="l4131"><span class="ln">4131 </span></a><span class="s0">which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings,</span>
<a name="l4132"><span class="ln">4132 </span></a><span class="s0">to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;--</span>
<a name="l4133"><span class="ln">4133 </span></a><span class="s0">here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another</span>
<a name="l4134"><span class="ln">4134 </span></a><span class="s0">man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said</span>
<a name="l4135"><span class="ln">4135 </span></a><span class="s0">and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.</span>
<a name="l4136"><span class="ln">4136 </span></a><span class="s0">Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses</span>
<a name="l4137"><span class="ln">4137 </span></a><span class="s0">and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle,</span>
<a name="l4138"><span class="ln">4138 </span></a><span class="s0">shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they</span>
<a name="l4139"><span class="ln">4139 </span></a><span class="s0">might have had at home.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4140"><span class="ln">4140 </span></a>
<a name="l4141"><span class="ln">4141 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt</span>
<a name="l4142"><span class="ln">4142 </span></a><span class="s0">he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the &quot;Very true, my love,&quot;</span>
<a name="l4143"><span class="ln">4143 </span></a><span class="s0">which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion;</span>
<a name="l4144"><span class="ln">4144 </span></a><span class="s0">but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer</span>
<a name="l4145"><span class="ln">4145 </span></a><span class="s0">at all.  She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome;</span>
<a name="l4146"><span class="ln">4146 </span></a><span class="s0">her heroism reached only to silence.  She allowed him to talk,</span>
<a name="l4147"><span class="ln">4147 </span></a><span class="s0">and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening</span>
<a name="l4148"><span class="ln">4148 </span></a><span class="s0">her lips.</span>
<a name="l4149"><span class="ln">4149 </span></a>
<a name="l4150"><span class="ln">4150 </span></a><span class="s0">They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,</span>
<a name="l4151"><span class="ln">4151 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly.</span>
<a name="l4152"><span class="ln">4152 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject.  Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l4153"><span class="ln">4153 </span></a><span class="s0">was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful</span>
<a name="l4154"><span class="ln">4154 </span></a><span class="s0">in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have</span>
<a name="l4155"><span class="ln">4155 </span></a><span class="s0">received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her.</span>
<a name="l4156"><span class="ln">4156 </span></a><span class="s0">She had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, &quot;Much the same--</span>
<a name="l4157"><span class="ln">4157 </span></a><span class="s0">not better.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4158"><span class="ln">4158 </span></a>
<a name="l4159"><span class="ln">4159 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's,&quot; said she presently, &quot;was not</span>
<a name="l4160"><span class="ln">4160 </span></a><span class="s0">so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better' was _my_ answer.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4161"><span class="ln">4161 </span></a>
<a name="l4162"><span class="ln">4162 </span></a><span class="s0">His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice</span>
<a name="l4163"><span class="ln">4163 </span></a><span class="s0">of sentiment as he answered.</span>
<a name="l4164"><span class="ln">4164 </span></a>
<a name="l4165"><span class="ln">4165 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that</span>
<a name="l4166"><span class="ln">4166 </span></a><span class="s0">when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing</span>
<a name="l4167"><span class="ln">4167 </span></a><span class="s0">before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,</span>
<a name="l4168"><span class="ln">4168 </span></a><span class="s0">by no means better, rather worse.  Very much grieved and concerned--</span>
<a name="l4169"><span class="ln">4169 </span></a><span class="s0">I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial</span>
<a name="l4170"><span class="ln">4170 </span></a><span class="s0">as I knew had been given her in the morning.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4171"><span class="ln">4171 </span></a>
<a name="l4172"><span class="ln">4172 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma smiled and answered--&quot;My visit was of use to the nervous part</span>
<a name="l4173"><span class="ln">4173 </span></a><span class="s0">of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;</span>
<a name="l4174"><span class="ln">4174 </span></a><span class="s0">it is a most severe cold indeed.  Mr. Perry has been with her,</span>
<a name="l4175"><span class="ln">4175 </span></a><span class="s0">as you probably heard.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4176"><span class="ln">4176 </span></a>
<a name="l4177"><span class="ln">4177 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--&quot;</span>
<a name="l4178"><span class="ln">4178 </span></a>
<a name="l4179"><span class="ln">4179 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow</span>
<a name="l4180"><span class="ln">4180 </span></a><span class="s0">morning will bring us both a more comfortable report.  But it is</span>
<a name="l4181"><span class="ln">4181 </span></a><span class="s0">impossible not to feel uneasiness.  Such a sad loss to our party to-day!&quot;</span>
<a name="l4182"><span class="ln">4182 </span></a>
<a name="l4183"><span class="ln">4183 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4184"><span class="ln">4184 </span></a>
<a name="l4185"><span class="ln">4185 </span></a><span class="s0">This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable;</span>
<a name="l4186"><span class="ln">4186 </span></a><span class="s0">but it should have lasted longer.  Emma was rather in dismay when</span>
<a name="l4187"><span class="ln">4187 </span></a><span class="s0">only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,</span>
<a name="l4188"><span class="ln">4188 </span></a><span class="s0">and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.</span>
<a name="l4189"><span class="ln">4189 </span></a>
<a name="l4190"><span class="ln">4190 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What an excellent device,&quot; said he, &quot;the use of a sheepskin</span>
<a name="l4191"><span class="ln">4191 </span></a><span class="s0">for carriages.  How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to</span>
<a name="l4192"><span class="ln">4192 </span></a><span class="s0">feel cold with such precautions.  The contrivances of modern days</span>
<a name="l4193"><span class="ln">4193 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete.</span>
<a name="l4194"><span class="ln">4194 </span></a><span class="s0">One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath</span>
<a name="l4195"><span class="ln">4195 </span></a><span class="s0">of air can find its way unpermitted.  Weather becomes absolutely</span>
<a name="l4196"><span class="ln">4196 </span></a><span class="s0">of no consequence.  It is a very cold afternoon--but in this carriage</span>
<a name="l4197"><span class="ln">4197 </span></a><span class="s0">we know nothing of the matter.--Ha! snows a little I see.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4198"><span class="ln">4198 </span></a>
<a name="l4199"><span class="ln">4199 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; said John Knightley, &quot;and I think we shall have a good deal</span>
<a name="l4200"><span class="ln">4200 </span></a><span class="s0">of it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4201"><span class="ln">4201 </span></a>
<a name="l4202"><span class="ln">4202 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Christmas weather,&quot; observed Mr. Elton.  &quot;Quite seasonable;</span>
<a name="l4203"><span class="ln">4203 </span></a><span class="s0">and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not</span>
<a name="l4204"><span class="ln">4204 </span></a><span class="s0">begin yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very</span>
<a name="l4205"><span class="ln">4205 </span></a><span class="s0">possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had</span>
<a name="l4206"><span class="ln">4206 </span></a><span class="s0">there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence.</span>
<a name="l4207"><span class="ln">4207 </span></a><span class="s0">This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings.  At Christmas</span>
<a name="l4208"><span class="ln">4208 </span></a><span class="s0">every body invites their friends about them, and people think little</span>
<a name="l4209"><span class="ln">4209 </span></a><span class="s0">of even the worst weather.  I was snowed up at a friend's house once</span>
<a name="l4210"><span class="ln">4210 </span></a><span class="s0">for a week.  Nothing could be pleasanter.  I went for only one night,</span>
<a name="l4211"><span class="ln">4211 </span></a><span class="s0">and could not get away till that very day se'nnight.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4212"><span class="ln">4212 </span></a>
<a name="l4213"><span class="ln">4213 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure,</span>
<a name="l4214"><span class="ln">4214 </span></a><span class="s0">but said only, coolly,</span>
<a name="l4215"><span class="ln">4215 </span></a>
<a name="l4216"><span class="ln">4216 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4217"><span class="ln">4217 </span></a>
<a name="l4218"><span class="ln">4218 </span></a><span class="s0">At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too</span>
<a name="l4219"><span class="ln">4219 </span></a><span class="s0">much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings.</span>
<a name="l4220"><span class="ln">4220 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.</span>
<a name="l4221"><span class="ln">4221 </span></a>
<a name="l4222"><span class="ln">4222 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We are sure of excellent fires,&quot; continued he, &quot;and every thing</span>
<a name="l4223"><span class="ln">4223 </span></a><span class="s0">in the greatest comfort.  Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--</span>
<a name="l4224"><span class="ln">4224 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly</span>
<a name="l4225"><span class="ln">4225 </span></a><span class="s0">what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;--</span>
<a name="l4226"><span class="ln">4226 </span></a><span class="s0">it will be a small party, but where small parties are select,</span>
<a name="l4227"><span class="ln">4227 </span></a><span class="s0">they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.  Mr. Weston's dining-room</span>
<a name="l4228"><span class="ln">4228 </span></a><span class="s0">does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part,</span>
<a name="l4229"><span class="ln">4229 </span></a><span class="s0">I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than</span>
<a name="l4230"><span class="ln">4230 </span></a><span class="s0">exceed by two.  I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft</span>
<a name="l4231"><span class="ln">4231 </span></a><span class="s0">air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,</span>
<a name="l4232"><span class="ln">4232 </span></a><span class="s0">though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties</span>
<a name="l4233"><span class="ln">4233 </span></a><span class="s0">of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4234"><span class="ln">4234 </span></a>
<a name="l4235"><span class="ln">4235 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine</span>
<a name="l4236"><span class="ln">4236 </span></a><span class="s0">with any body.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4237"><span class="ln">4237 </span></a>
<a name="l4238"><span class="ln">4238 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the</span>
<a name="l4239"><span class="ln">4239 </span></a><span class="s0">law had been so great a slavery.  Well, sir, the time must come</span>
<a name="l4240"><span class="ln">4240 </span></a><span class="s0">when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little</span>
<a name="l4241"><span class="ln">4241 </span></a><span class="s0">labour and great enjoyment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4242"><span class="ln">4242 </span></a>
<a name="l4243"><span class="ln">4243 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My first enjoyment,&quot; replied John Knightley, as they passed through</span>
<a name="l4244"><span class="ln">4244 </span></a><span class="s0">the sweep-gate, &quot;will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4245"><span class="ln">4245 </span></a>
<a name="l4246"><span class="ln">4246 </span></a>
<a name="l4247"><span class="ln">4247 </span></a>
<a name="l4248"><span class="ln">4248 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<a name="l4249"><span class="ln">4249 </span></a>
<a name="l4250"><span class="ln">4250 </span></a>
<a name="l4251"><span class="ln">4251 </span></a><span class="s0">Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman</span>
<a name="l4252"><span class="ln">4252 </span></a><span class="s0">as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must</span>
<a name="l4253"><span class="ln">4253 </span></a><span class="s0">compose his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his</span>
<a name="l4254"><span class="ln">4254 </span></a><span class="s0">ill-humour. Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more,</span>
<a name="l4255"><span class="ln">4255 </span></a><span class="s0">to fit them for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted,</span>
<a name="l4256"><span class="ln">4256 </span></a><span class="s0">and shew herself just as happy as she was.  To her it was real</span>
<a name="l4257"><span class="ln">4257 </span></a><span class="s0">enjoyment to be with the Westons.  Mr. Weston was a great favourite,</span>
<a name="l4258"><span class="ln">4258 </span></a><span class="s0">and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with</span>
<a name="l4259"><span class="ln">4259 </span></a><span class="s0">such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related</span>
<a name="l4260"><span class="ln">4260 </span></a><span class="s0">with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being</span>
<a name="l4261"><span class="ln">4261 </span></a><span class="s0">always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs,</span>
<a name="l4262"><span class="ln">4262 </span></a><span class="s0">arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself.</span>
<a name="l4263"><span class="ln">4263 </span></a><span class="s0">She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not</span>
<a name="l4264"><span class="ln">4264 </span></a><span class="s0">a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication</span>
<a name="l4265"><span class="ln">4265 </span></a><span class="s0">of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private</span>
<a name="l4266"><span class="ln">4266 </span></a><span class="s0">life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.</span>
<a name="l4267"><span class="ln">4267 </span></a>
<a name="l4268"><span class="ln">4268 </span></a><span class="s0">This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might</span>
<a name="l4269"><span class="ln">4269 </span></a><span class="s0">not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour;</span>
<a name="l4270"><span class="ln">4270 </span></a><span class="s0">but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice</span>
<a name="l4271"><span class="ln">4271 </span></a><span class="s0">was grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as</span>
<a name="l4272"><span class="ln">4272 </span></a><span class="s0">possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant,</span>
<a name="l4273"><span class="ln">4273 </span></a><span class="s0">and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.</span>
<a name="l4274"><span class="ln">4274 </span></a>
<a name="l4275"><span class="ln">4275 </span></a><span class="s0">The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through</span>
<a name="l4276"><span class="ln">4276 </span></a><span class="s0">before her arrival.  Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long</span>
<a name="l4277"><span class="ln">4277 </span></a><span class="s0">enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own</span>
<a name="l4278"><span class="ln">4278 </span></a><span class="s0">and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed</span>
<a name="l4279"><span class="ln">4279 </span></a><span class="s0">just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come</span>
<a name="l4280"><span class="ln">4280 </span></a><span class="s0">and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l4281"><span class="ln">4281 </span></a><span class="s0">who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him,</span>
<a name="l4282"><span class="ln">4282 </span></a><span class="s0">was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.</span>
<a name="l4283"><span class="ln">4283 </span></a>
<a name="l4284"><span class="ln">4284 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather</span>
<a name="l4285"><span class="ln">4285 </span></a><span class="s0">sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was</span>
<a name="l4286"><span class="ln">4286 </span></a><span class="s0">close to her.  The difficulty was great of driving his strange</span>
<a name="l4287"><span class="ln">4287 </span></a><span class="s0">insensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat</span>
<a name="l4288"><span class="ln">4288 </span></a><span class="s0">at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance</span>
<a name="l4289"><span class="ln">4289 </span></a><span class="s0">on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.</span>
<a name="l4290"><span class="ln">4290 </span></a><span class="s0">Instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could</span>
<a name="l4291"><span class="ln">4291 </span></a><span class="s0">not avoid the internal suggestion of &quot;Can it really be as my brother</span>
<a name="l4292"><span class="ln">4292 </span></a><span class="s0">imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer</span>
<a name="l4293"><span class="ln">4293 </span></a><span class="s0">his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!&quot;--</span>
<a name="l4294"><span class="ln">4294 </span></a><span class="s0">Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be</span>
<a name="l4295"><span class="ln">4295 </span></a><span class="s0">so interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston;</span>
<a name="l4296"><span class="ln">4296 </span></a><span class="s0">and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal</span>
<a name="l4297"><span class="ln">4297 </span></a><span class="s0">and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover,</span>
<a name="l4298"><span class="ln">4298 </span></a><span class="s0">and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.</span>
<a name="l4299"><span class="ln">4299 </span></a><span class="s0">For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope</span>
<a name="l4300"><span class="ln">4300 </span></a><span class="s0">that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil;</span>
<a name="l4301"><span class="ln">4301 </span></a><span class="s0">but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst</span>
<a name="l4302"><span class="ln">4302 </span></a><span class="s0">the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense,</span>
<a name="l4303"><span class="ln">4303 </span></a><span class="s0">which she particularly wished to listen to.  She heard enough</span>
<a name="l4304"><span class="ln">4304 </span></a><span class="s0">to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son;</span>
<a name="l4305"><span class="ln">4305 </span></a><span class="s0">she heard the words &quot;my son,&quot; and &quot;Frank,&quot; and &quot;my son,&quot;</span>
<a name="l4306"><span class="ln">4306 </span></a><span class="s0">repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables</span>
<a name="l4307"><span class="ln">4307 </span></a><span class="s0">very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from</span>
<a name="l4308"><span class="ln">4308 </span></a><span class="s0">his son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was</span>
<a name="l4309"><span class="ln">4309 </span></a><span class="s0">so completely past that any reviving question from her would have</span>
<a name="l4310"><span class="ln">4310 </span></a><span class="s0">been awkward.</span>
<a name="l4311"><span class="ln">4311 </span></a>
<a name="l4312"><span class="ln">4312 </span></a><span class="s0">Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying,</span>
<a name="l4313"><span class="ln">4313 </span></a><span class="s0">there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill,</span>
<a name="l4314"><span class="ln">4314 </span></a><span class="s0">which always interested her.  She had frequently thought--especially since</span>
<a name="l4315"><span class="ln">4315 </span></a><span class="s0">his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that if she _were_ to marry,</span>
<a name="l4316"><span class="ln">4316 </span></a><span class="s0">he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.</span>
<a name="l4317"><span class="ln">4317 </span></a><span class="s0">He seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her.</span>
<a name="l4318"><span class="ln">4318 </span></a><span class="s0">She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew</span>
<a name="l4319"><span class="ln">4319 </span></a><span class="s0">them must think of.  That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she was</span>
<a name="l4320"><span class="ln">4320 </span></a><span class="s0">very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him,</span>
<a name="l4321"><span class="ln">4321 </span></a><span class="s0">or by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more</span>
<a name="l4322"><span class="ln">4322 </span></a><span class="s0">replete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great</span>
<a name="l4323"><span class="ln">4323 </span></a><span class="s0">curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant,</span>
<a name="l4324"><span class="ln">4324 </span></a><span class="s0">of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure</span>
<a name="l4325"><span class="ln">4325 </span></a><span class="s0">in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations.</span>
<a name="l4326"><span class="ln">4326 </span></a>
<a name="l4327"><span class="ln">4327 </span></a><span class="s0">With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;</span>
<a name="l4328"><span class="ln">4328 </span></a><span class="s0">but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling</span>
<a name="l4329"><span class="ln">4329 </span></a><span class="s0">very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not</span>
<a name="l4330"><span class="ln">4330 </span></a><span class="s0">possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,</span>
<a name="l4331"><span class="ln">4331 </span></a><span class="s0">or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--</span>
<a name="l4332"><span class="ln">4332 </span></a><span class="s0">for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,</span>
<a name="l4333"><span class="ln">4333 </span></a><span class="s0">at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares</span>
<a name="l4334"><span class="ln">4334 </span></a><span class="s0">of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton,</span>
<a name="l4335"><span class="ln">4335 </span></a><span class="s0">to say to her,</span>
<a name="l4336"><span class="ln">4336 </span></a>
<a name="l4337"><span class="ln">4337 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We want only two more to be just the right number.  I should</span>
<a name="l4338"><span class="ln">4338 </span></a><span class="s0">like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith,</span>
<a name="l4339"><span class="ln">4339 </span></a><span class="s0">and my son--and then I should say we were quite complete.</span>
<a name="l4340"><span class="ln">4340 </span></a><span class="s0">I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room</span>
<a name="l4341"><span class="ln">4341 </span></a><span class="s0">that we are expecting Frank.  I had a letter from him this morning,</span>
<a name="l4342"><span class="ln">4342 </span></a><span class="s0">and he will be with us within a fortnight.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4343"><span class="ln">4343 </span></a>
<a name="l4344"><span class="ln">4344 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented</span>
<a name="l4345"><span class="ln">4345 </span></a><span class="s0">to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making</span>
<a name="l4346"><span class="ln">4346 </span></a><span class="s0">their party quite complete.</span>
<a name="l4347"><span class="ln">4347 </span></a>
<a name="l4348"><span class="ln">4348 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He has been wanting to come to us,&quot; continued Mr. Weston,</span>
<a name="l4349"><span class="ln">4349 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;ever since September:  every letter has been full of it;</span>
<a name="l4350"><span class="ln">4350 </span></a><span class="s0">but he cannot command his own time.  He has those to please</span>
<a name="l4351"><span class="ln">4351 </span></a><span class="s0">who must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes</span>
<a name="l4352"><span class="ln">4352 </span></a><span class="s0">to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.  But now</span>
<a name="l4353"><span class="ln">4353 </span></a><span class="s0">I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4354"><span class="ln">4354 </span></a>
<a name="l4355"><span class="ln">4355 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l4356"><span class="ln">4356 </span></a><span class="s0">is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost</span>
<a name="l4357"><span class="ln">4357 </span></a><span class="s0">as happy as yourself.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4358"><span class="ln">4358 </span></a>
<a name="l4359"><span class="ln">4359 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another</span>
<a name="l4360"><span class="ln">4360 </span></a><span class="s0">put-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do:</span>
<a name="l4361"><span class="ln">4361 </span></a><span class="s0">but she does not know the parties so well as I do.  The case,</span>
<a name="l4362"><span class="ln">4362 </span></a><span class="s0">you see, is--(but this is quite between ourselves:  I did not mention</span>
<a name="l4363"><span class="ln">4363 </span></a><span class="s0">a syllable of it in the other room.  There are secrets in all families,</span>
<a name="l4364"><span class="ln">4364 </span></a><span class="s0">you know)--The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay</span>
<a name="l4365"><span class="ln">4365 </span></a><span class="s0">a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon</span>
<a name="l4366"><span class="ln">4366 </span></a><span class="s0">their being put off.  If they are not put off, he cannot stir.</span>
<a name="l4367"><span class="ln">4367 </span></a><span class="s0">But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady,</span>
<a name="l4368"><span class="ln">4368 </span></a><span class="s0">of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to:</span>
<a name="l4369"><span class="ln">4369 </span></a><span class="s0">and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or</span>
<a name="l4370"><span class="ln">4370 </span></a><span class="s0">three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.</span>
<a name="l4371"><span class="ln">4371 </span></a><span class="s0">I have not the smallest doubt of the issue.  I am as confident</span>
<a name="l4372"><span class="ln">4372 </span></a><span class="s0">of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am</span>
<a name="l4373"><span class="ln">4373 </span></a><span class="s0">of being here myself:  but your good friend there (nodding</span>
<a name="l4374"><span class="ln">4374 </span></a><span class="s0">towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself,</span>
<a name="l4375"><span class="ln">4375 </span></a><span class="s0">and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot</span>
<a name="l4376"><span class="ln">4376 </span></a><span class="s0">calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice</span>
<a name="l4377"><span class="ln">4377 </span></a><span class="s0">of doing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4378"><span class="ln">4378 </span></a>
<a name="l4379"><span class="ln">4379 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,&quot;</span>
<a name="l4380"><span class="ln">4380 </span></a><span class="s0">replied Emma; &quot;but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston.  If you</span>
<a name="l4381"><span class="ln">4381 </span></a><span class="s0">think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4382"><span class="ln">4382 </span></a>
<a name="l4383"><span class="ln">4383 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been</span>
<a name="l4384"><span class="ln">4384 </span></a><span class="s0">at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow</span>
<a name="l4385"><span class="ln">4385 </span></a><span class="s0">myself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe</span>
<a name="l4386"><span class="ln">4386 </span></a><span class="s0">her to be very fond of him.  I used to think she was not capable</span>
<a name="l4387"><span class="ln">4387 </span></a><span class="s0">of being fond of any body, except herself:  but she has always been</span>
<a name="l4388"><span class="ln">4388 </span></a><span class="s0">kind to him (in her way--allowing for little whims and caprices,</span>
<a name="l4389"><span class="ln">4389 </span></a><span class="s0">and expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit,</span>
<a name="l4390"><span class="ln">4390 </span></a><span class="s0">in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection;</span>
<a name="l4391"><span class="ln">4391 </span></a><span class="s0">for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more</span>
<a name="l4392"><span class="ln">4392 </span></a><span class="s0">heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4393"><span class="ln">4393 </span></a>
<a name="l4394"><span class="ln">4394 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l4395"><span class="ln">4395 </span></a><span class="s0">very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--</span>
<a name="l4396"><span class="ln">4396 </span></a><span class="s0">yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--</span>
<a name="l4397"><span class="ln">4397 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very</span>
<a name="l4398"><span class="ln">4398 </span></a><span class="s0">glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting</span>
<a name="l4399"><span class="ln">4399 </span></a><span class="s0">at the time talked of:  &quot;for I cannot depend upon his coming.</span>
<a name="l4400"><span class="ln">4400 </span></a><span class="s0">I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston.  I am very much afraid</span>
<a name="l4401"><span class="ln">4401 </span></a><span class="s0">that it will all end in nothing.  Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been</span>
<a name="l4402"><span class="ln">4402 </span></a><span class="s0">telling you exactly how the matter stands?&quot;</span>
<a name="l4403"><span class="ln">4403 </span></a>
<a name="l4404"><span class="ln">4404 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour</span>
<a name="l4405"><span class="ln">4405 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain</span>
<a name="l4406"><span class="ln">4406 </span></a><span class="s0">thing in the world.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4407"><span class="ln">4407 </span></a>
<a name="l4408"><span class="ln">4408 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My Emma!&quot; replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, &quot;what is the certainty</span>
<a name="l4409"><span class="ln">4409 </span></a><span class="s0">of caprice?&quot;  Then turning to Isabella, who had not been</span>
<a name="l4410"><span class="ln">4410 </span></a><span class="s0">attending before--&quot;You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l4411"><span class="ln">4411 </span></a><span class="s0">that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill,</span>
<a name="l4412"><span class="ln">4412 </span></a><span class="s0">in my opinion, as his father thinks.  It depends entirely upon</span>
<a name="l4413"><span class="ln">4413 </span></a><span class="s0">his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper.</span>
<a name="l4414"><span class="ln">4414 </span></a><span class="s0">To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on the truth.</span>
<a name="l4415"><span class="ln">4415 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman;</span>
<a name="l4416"><span class="ln">4416 </span></a><span class="s0">and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4417"><span class="ln">4417 </span></a>
<a name="l4418"><span class="ln">4418 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,&quot;</span>
<a name="l4419"><span class="ln">4419 </span></a><span class="s0">replied Isabella:  &quot;and I am sure I never think of that poor young</span>
<a name="l4420"><span class="ln">4420 </span></a><span class="s0">man without the greatest compassion.  To be constantly living</span>
<a name="l4421"><span class="ln">4421 </span></a><span class="s0">with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful.  It is what we</span>
<a name="l4422"><span class="ln">4422 </span></a><span class="s0">happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life</span>
<a name="l4423"><span class="ln">4423 </span></a><span class="s0">of misery.  What a blessing, that she never had any children!</span>
<a name="l4424"><span class="ln">4424 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!&quot;</span>
<a name="l4425"><span class="ln">4425 </span></a>
<a name="l4426"><span class="ln">4426 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston.  She should then have</span>
<a name="l4427"><span class="ln">4427 </span></a><span class="s0">heard more:  Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve</span>
<a name="l4428"><span class="ln">4428 </span></a><span class="s0">which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,</span>
<a name="l4429"><span class="ln">4429 </span></a><span class="s0">would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills</span>
<a name="l4430"><span class="ln">4430 </span></a><span class="s0">from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own</span>
<a name="l4431"><span class="ln">4431 </span></a><span class="s0">imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.</span>
<a name="l4432"><span class="ln">4432 </span></a><span class="s0">But at present there was nothing more to be said.  Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l4433"><span class="ln">4433 </span></a><span class="s0">very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting</span>
<a name="l4434"><span class="ln">4434 </span></a><span class="s0">long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure.</span>
<a name="l4435"><span class="ln">4435 </span></a><span class="s0">Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did</span>
<a name="l4436"><span class="ln">4436 </span></a><span class="s0">he move to those with whom he was always comfortable.</span>
<a name="l4437"><span class="ln">4437 </span></a>
<a name="l4438"><span class="ln">4438 </span></a><span class="s0">While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity</span>
<a name="l4439"><span class="ln">4439 </span></a><span class="s0">of saying,</span>
<a name="l4440"><span class="ln">4440 </span></a>
<a name="l4441"><span class="ln">4441 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any</span>
<a name="l4442"><span class="ln">4442 </span></a><span class="s0">means certain.  I am sorry for it.  The introduction must be unpleasant,</span>
<a name="l4443"><span class="ln">4443 </span></a><span class="s0">whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4444"><span class="ln">4444 </span></a>
<a name="l4445"><span class="ln">4445 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.</span>
<a name="l4446"><span class="ln">4446 </span></a><span class="s0">Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still</span>
<a name="l4447"><span class="ln">4447 </span></a><span class="s0">afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us.</span>
<a name="l4448"><span class="ln">4448 </span></a><span class="s0">I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure</span>
<a name="l4449"><span class="ln">4449 </span></a><span class="s0">there is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep him to themselves.</span>
<a name="l4450"><span class="ln">4450 </span></a><span class="s0">There is jealousy.  They are jealous even of his regard for his father.</span>
<a name="l4451"><span class="ln">4451 </span></a><span class="s0">In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston</span>
<a name="l4452"><span class="ln">4452 </span></a><span class="s0">were less sanguine.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4453"><span class="ln">4453 </span></a>
<a name="l4454"><span class="ln">4454 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He ought to come,&quot; said Emma.  &quot;If he could stay only a couple</span>
<a name="l4455"><span class="ln">4455 </span></a><span class="s0">of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's</span>
<a name="l4456"><span class="ln">4456 </span></a><span class="s0">not having it in his power to do as much as that.  A young _woman_,</span>
<a name="l4457"><span class="ln">4457 </span></a><span class="s0">if she fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance</span>
<a name="l4458"><span class="ln">4458 </span></a><span class="s0">from those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young</span>
<a name="l4459"><span class="ln">4459 </span></a><span class="s0">_man_'s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week</span>
<a name="l4460"><span class="ln">4460 </span></a><span class="s0">with his father, if he likes it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4461"><span class="ln">4461 </span></a>
<a name="l4462"><span class="ln">4462 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,</span>
<a name="l4463"><span class="ln">4463 </span></a><span class="s0">before one decides upon what he can do,&quot; replied Mrs. Weston.</span>
<a name="l4464"><span class="ln">4464 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the</span>
<a name="l4465"><span class="ln">4465 </span></a><span class="s0">conduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe,</span>
<a name="l4466"><span class="ln">4466 </span></a><span class="s0">I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules:</span>
<a name="l4467"><span class="ln">4467 </span></a><span class="s0">_she_ is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4468"><span class="ln">4468 </span></a>
<a name="l4469"><span class="ln">4469 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But she is so fond of the nephew:  he is so very great a favourite.</span>
<a name="l4470"><span class="ln">4470 </span></a><span class="s0">Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,</span>
<a name="l4471"><span class="ln">4471 </span></a><span class="s0">that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband,</span>
<a name="l4472"><span class="ln">4472 </span></a><span class="s0">to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice</span>
<a name="l4473"><span class="ln">4473 </span></a><span class="s0">towards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew,</span>
<a name="l4474"><span class="ln">4474 </span></a><span class="s0">to whom she owes nothing at all.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4475"><span class="ln">4475 </span></a>
<a name="l4476"><span class="ln">4476 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper,</span>
<a name="l4477"><span class="ln">4477 </span></a><span class="s0">to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it:  you must</span>
<a name="l4478"><span class="ln">4478 </span></a><span class="s0">let it go its own way.  I have no doubt of his having, at times,</span>
<a name="l4479"><span class="ln">4479 </span></a><span class="s0">considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him</span>
<a name="l4480"><span class="ln">4480 </span></a><span class="s0">to know beforehand _when_ it will be.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4481"><span class="ln">4481 </span></a>
<a name="l4482"><span class="ln">4482 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma listened, and then coolly said, &quot;I shall not be satisfied,</span>
<a name="l4483"><span class="ln">4483 </span></a><span class="s0">unless he comes.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4484"><span class="ln">4484 </span></a>
<a name="l4485"><span class="ln">4485 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He may have a great deal of influence on some points,&quot;</span>
<a name="l4486"><span class="ln">4486 </span></a><span class="s0">continued Mrs. Weston, &quot;and on others, very little:  and among those,</span>
<a name="l4487"><span class="ln">4487 </span></a><span class="s0">on which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be</span>
<a name="l4488"><span class="ln">4488 </span></a><span class="s0">this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4489"><span class="ln">4489 </span></a>
<a name="l4490"><span class="ln">4490 </span></a>
<a name="l4491"><span class="ln">4491 </span></a>
<a name="l4492"><span class="ln">4492 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>
<a name="l4493"><span class="ln">4493 </span></a>
<a name="l4494"><span class="ln">4494 </span></a>
<a name="l4495"><span class="ln">4495 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his</span>
<a name="l4496"><span class="ln">4496 </span></a><span class="s0">tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three</span>
<a name="l4497"><span class="ln">4497 </span></a><span class="s0">companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness</span>
<a name="l4498"><span class="ln">4498 </span></a><span class="s0">of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared.  Mr. Weston was</span>
<a name="l4499"><span class="ln">4499 </span></a><span class="s0">chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort;</span>
<a name="l4500"><span class="ln">4500 </span></a><span class="s0">but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation.</span>
<a name="l4501"><span class="ln">4501 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.</span>
<a name="l4502"><span class="ln">4502 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa.  He joined</span>
<a name="l4503"><span class="ln">4503 </span></a><span class="s0">them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself</span>
<a name="l4504"><span class="ln">4504 </span></a><span class="s0">between them.</span>
<a name="l4505"><span class="ln">4505 </span></a>
<a name="l4506"><span class="ln">4506 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind</span>
<a name="l4507"><span class="ln">4507 </span></a><span class="s0">by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget</span>
<a name="l4508"><span class="ln">4508 </span></a><span class="s0">his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before,</span>
<a name="l4509"><span class="ln">4509 </span></a><span class="s0">and on his making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen</span>
<a name="l4510"><span class="ln">4510 </span></a><span class="s0">with most friendly smiles.</span>
<a name="l4511"><span class="ln">4511 </span></a>
<a name="l4512"><span class="ln">4512 </span></a><span class="s0">He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--</span>
<a name="l4513"><span class="ln">4513 </span></a><span class="s0">her fair, lovely, amiable friend.  &quot;Did she know?--had she</span>
<a name="l4514"><span class="ln">4514 </span></a><span class="s0">heard any thing about her, since their being at Randalls?--</span>
<a name="l4515"><span class="ln">4515 </span></a><span class="s0">he felt much anxiety--he must confess that the nature of her</span>
<a name="l4516"><span class="ln">4516 </span></a><span class="s0">complaint alarmed him considerably.&quot;  And in this style he talked</span>
<a name="l4517"><span class="ln">4517 </span></a><span class="s0">on for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer,</span>
<a name="l4518"><span class="ln">4518 </span></a><span class="s0">but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat;</span>
<a name="l4519"><span class="ln">4519 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma was quite in charity with him.</span>
<a name="l4520"><span class="ln">4520 </span></a>
<a name="l4521"><span class="ln">4521 </span></a><span class="s0">But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if</span>
<a name="l4522"><span class="ln">4522 </span></a><span class="s0">he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account,</span>
<a name="l4523"><span class="ln">4523 </span></a><span class="s0">than on Harriet's--more anxious that she should escape the infection,</span>
<a name="l4524"><span class="ln">4524 </span></a><span class="s0">than that there should be no infection in the complaint.  He began</span>
<a name="l4525"><span class="ln">4525 </span></a><span class="s0">with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting</span>
<a name="l4526"><span class="ln">4526 </span></a><span class="s0">the sick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat her to _promise_</span>
<a name="l4527"><span class="ln">4527 </span></a><span class="s0">_him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry</span>
<a name="l4528"><span class="ln">4528 </span></a><span class="s0">and learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off</span>
<a name="l4529"><span class="ln">4529 </span></a><span class="s0">and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no</span>
<a name="l4530"><span class="ln">4530 </span></a><span class="s0">putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her.  She was vexed.</span>
<a name="l4531"><span class="ln">4531 </span></a><span class="s0">It did appear--there was no concealing it--exactly like the pretence</span>
<a name="l4532"><span class="ln">4532 </span></a><span class="s0">of being in love with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy,</span>
<a name="l4533"><span class="ln">4533 </span></a><span class="s0">if real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty</span>
<a name="l4534"><span class="ln">4534 </span></a><span class="s0">in behaving with temper.  He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore</span>
<a name="l4535"><span class="ln">4535 </span></a><span class="s0">her assistance, &quot;Would not she give him her support?--would not she</span>
<a name="l4536"><span class="ln">4536 </span></a><span class="s0">add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go</span>
<a name="l4537"><span class="ln">4537 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder</span>
<a name="l4538"><span class="ln">4538 </span></a><span class="s0">had no infection?  He could not be satisfied without a promise--</span>
<a name="l4539"><span class="ln">4539 </span></a><span class="s0">would not she give him her influence in procuring it?&quot;</span>
<a name="l4540"><span class="ln">4540 </span></a>
<a name="l4541"><span class="ln">4541 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So scrupulous for others,&quot; he continued, &quot;and yet so careless</span>
<a name="l4542"><span class="ln">4542 </span></a><span class="s0">for herself!  She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day,</span>
<a name="l4543"><span class="ln">4543 </span></a><span class="s0">and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated</span>
<a name="l4544"><span class="ln">4544 </span></a><span class="s0">sore throat herself.  Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us.</span>
<a name="l4545"><span class="ln">4545 </span></a><span class="s0">Have not I some right to complain?  I am sure of your kind support</span>
<a name="l4546"><span class="ln">4546 </span></a><span class="s0">and aid.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4547"><span class="ln">4547 </span></a>
<a name="l4548"><span class="ln">4548 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great,</span>
<a name="l4549"><span class="ln">4549 </span></a><span class="s0">at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself</span>
<a name="l4550"><span class="ln">4550 </span></a><span class="s0">the right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was</span>
<a name="l4551"><span class="ln">4551 </span></a><span class="s0">too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly</span>
<a name="l4552"><span class="ln">4552 </span></a><span class="s0">saying any thing to the purpose.  She could only give him a look;</span>
<a name="l4553"><span class="ln">4553 </span></a><span class="s0">but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses,</span>
<a name="l4554"><span class="ln">4554 </span></a><span class="s0">and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving</span>
<a name="l4555"><span class="ln">4555 </span></a><span class="s0">her all her attention.</span>
<a name="l4556"><span class="ln">4556 </span></a>
<a name="l4557"><span class="ln">4557 </span></a><span class="s0">She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly</span>
<a name="l4558"><span class="ln">4558 </span></a><span class="s0">did another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came</span>
<a name="l4559"><span class="ln">4559 </span></a><span class="s0">into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them</span>
<a name="l4560"><span class="ln">4560 </span></a><span class="s0">all with the information of the ground being covered with snow,</span>
<a name="l4561"><span class="ln">4561 </span></a><span class="s0">and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind;</span>
<a name="l4562"><span class="ln">4562 </span></a><span class="s0">concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:</span>
<a name="l4563"><span class="ln">4563 </span></a>
<a name="l4564"><span class="ln">4564 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,</span>
<a name="l4565"><span class="ln">4565 </span></a><span class="s0">sir.  Something new for your coachman and horses to be making</span>
<a name="l4566"><span class="ln">4566 </span></a><span class="s0">their way through a storm of snow.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4567"><span class="ln">4567 </span></a>
<a name="l4568"><span class="ln">4568 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else</span>
<a name="l4569"><span class="ln">4569 </span></a><span class="s0">had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,</span>
<a name="l4570"><span class="ln">4570 </span></a><span class="s0">and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.  Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l4571"><span class="ln">4571 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention</span>
<a name="l4572"><span class="ln">4572 </span></a><span class="s0">from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.</span>
<a name="l4573"><span class="ln">4573 </span></a>
<a name="l4574"><span class="ln">4574 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I admired your resolution very much, sir,&quot; said he, &quot;in venturing</span>
<a name="l4575"><span class="ln">4575 </span></a><span class="s0">out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow</span>
<a name="l4576"><span class="ln">4576 </span></a><span class="s0">very soon.  Every body must have seen the snow coming on.</span>
<a name="l4577"><span class="ln">4577 </span></a><span class="s0">I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.</span>
<a name="l4578"><span class="ln">4578 </span></a><span class="s0">Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable;</span>
<a name="l4579"><span class="ln">4579 </span></a><span class="s0">and we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part</span>
<a name="l4580"><span class="ln">4580 </span></a><span class="s0">of the common field there will be the other at hand.  I dare say we</span>
<a name="l4581"><span class="ln">4581 </span></a><span class="s0">shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4582"><span class="ln">4582 </span></a>
<a name="l4583"><span class="ln">4583 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he</span>
<a name="l4584"><span class="ln">4584 </span></a><span class="s0">had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word,</span>
<a name="l4585"><span class="ln">4585 </span></a><span class="s0">lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse</span>
<a name="l4586"><span class="ln">4586 </span></a><span class="s0">for his hurrying away.  As to there being any quantity of snow fallen</span>
<a name="l4587"><span class="ln">4587 </span></a><span class="s0">or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke;</span>
<a name="l4588"><span class="ln">4588 </span></a><span class="s0">he was afraid they would find no difficulty.  He wished the road might</span>
<a name="l4589"><span class="ln">4589 </span></a><span class="s0">be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls;</span>
<a name="l4590"><span class="ln">4590 </span></a><span class="s0">and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might</span>
<a name="l4591"><span class="ln">4591 </span></a><span class="s0">be found for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him,</span>
<a name="l4592"><span class="ln">4592 </span></a><span class="s0">that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged,</span>
<a name="l4593"><span class="ln">4593 </span></a><span class="s0">which she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there</span>
<a name="l4594"><span class="ln">4594 </span></a><span class="s0">being but two spare rooms in the house.</span>
<a name="l4595"><span class="ln">4595 </span></a>
<a name="l4596"><span class="ln">4596 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?&quot;</span>
<a name="l4597"><span class="ln">4597 </span></a><span class="s0">was Mr. Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say</span>
<a name="l4598"><span class="ln">4598 </span></a><span class="s0">for some time.  To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances</span>
<a name="l4599"><span class="ln">4599 </span></a><span class="s0">of safety, her representation of the excellence of the horses,</span>
<a name="l4600"><span class="ln">4600 </span></a><span class="s0">and of James, and of their having so many friends about them,</span>
<a name="l4601"><span class="ln">4601 </span></a><span class="s0">revived him a little.</span>
<a name="l4602"><span class="ln">4602 </span></a>
<a name="l4603"><span class="ln">4603 </span></a><span class="s0">His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own.  The horror of</span>
<a name="l4604"><span class="ln">4604 </span></a><span class="s0">being blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l4605"><span class="ln">4605 </span></a><span class="s0">was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just</span>
<a name="l4606"><span class="ln">4606 </span></a><span class="s0">passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay,</span>
<a name="l4607"><span class="ln">4607 </span></a><span class="s0">she was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain</span>
<a name="l4608"><span class="ln">4608 </span></a><span class="s0">at Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through</span>
<a name="l4609"><span class="ln">4609 </span></a><span class="s0">all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.</span>
<a name="l4610"><span class="ln">4610 </span></a>
<a name="l4611"><span class="ln">4611 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You had better order the carriage directly, my love,&quot; said she;</span>
<a name="l4612"><span class="ln">4612 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly;</span>
<a name="l4613"><span class="ln">4613 </span></a><span class="s0">and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.</span>
<a name="l4614"><span class="ln">4614 </span></a><span class="s0">I am not at all afraid.  I should not mind walking half the way.</span>
<a name="l4615"><span class="ln">4615 </span></a><span class="s0">I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not</span>
<a name="l4616"><span class="ln">4616 </span></a><span class="s0">the sort of thing that gives me cold.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4617"><span class="ln">4617 </span></a>
<a name="l4618"><span class="ln">4618 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed!&quot; replied he.  &quot;Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most</span>
<a name="l4619"><span class="ln">4619 </span></a><span class="s0">extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every</span>
<a name="l4620"><span class="ln">4620 </span></a><span class="s0">thing does give you cold.  Walk home!--you are prettily shod</span>
<a name="l4621"><span class="ln">4621 </span></a><span class="s0">for walking home, I dare say.  It will be bad enough for the horses.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4622"><span class="ln">4622 </span></a>
<a name="l4623"><span class="ln">4623 </span></a><span class="s0">Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan.</span>
<a name="l4624"><span class="ln">4624 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston could only approve.  Isabella then went to Emma;</span>
<a name="l4625"><span class="ln">4625 </span></a><span class="s0">but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being</span>
<a name="l4626"><span class="ln">4626 </span></a><span class="s0">all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point,</span>
<a name="l4627"><span class="ln">4627 </span></a><span class="s0">when Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his</span>
<a name="l4628"><span class="ln">4628 </span></a><span class="s0">brother's first report of the snow, came back again, and told them</span>
<a name="l4629"><span class="ln">4629 </span></a><span class="s0">that he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there</span>
<a name="l4630"><span class="ln">4630 </span></a><span class="s0">not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they</span>
<a name="l4631"><span class="ln">4631 </span></a><span class="s0">liked it, either now or an hour hence.  He had gone beyond the sweep--</span>
<a name="l4632"><span class="ln">4632 </span></a><span class="s0">some way along the Highbury road--the snow was nowhere above half</span>
<a name="l4633"><span class="ln">4633 </span></a><span class="s0">an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground;</span>
<a name="l4634"><span class="ln">4634 </span></a><span class="s0">a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting,</span>
<a name="l4635"><span class="ln">4635 </span></a><span class="s0">and there was every appearance of its being soon over.  He had seen</span>
<a name="l4636"><span class="ln">4636 </span></a><span class="s0">the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there being nothing</span>
<a name="l4637"><span class="ln">4637 </span></a><span class="s0">to apprehend.</span>
<a name="l4638"><span class="ln">4638 </span></a>
<a name="l4639"><span class="ln">4639 </span></a><span class="s0">To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they</span>
<a name="l4640"><span class="ln">4640 </span></a><span class="s0">were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account,</span>
<a name="l4641"><span class="ln">4641 </span></a><span class="s0">who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous</span>
<a name="l4642"><span class="ln">4642 </span></a><span class="s0">constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not</span>
<a name="l4643"><span class="ln">4643 </span></a><span class="s0">be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued</span>
<a name="l4644"><span class="ln">4644 </span></a><span class="s0">at Randalls.  He was satisfied of there being no present danger in</span>
<a name="l4645"><span class="ln">4645 </span></a><span class="s0">returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe</span>
<a name="l4646"><span class="ln">4646 </span></a><span class="s0">to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,</span>
<a name="l4647"><span class="ln">4647 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences:  thus--</span>
<a name="l4648"><span class="ln">4648 </span></a>
<a name="l4649"><span class="ln">4649 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?&quot;</span>
<a name="l4650"><span class="ln">4650 </span></a>
<a name="l4651"><span class="ln">4651 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am ready, if the others are.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4652"><span class="ln">4652 </span></a>
<a name="l4653"><span class="ln">4653 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Shall I ring the bell?&quot;</span>
<a name="l4654"><span class="ln">4654 </span></a>
<a name="l4655"><span class="ln">4655 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, do.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4656"><span class="ln">4656 </span></a>
<a name="l4657"><span class="ln">4657 </span></a><span class="s0">And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.  A few</span>
<a name="l4658"><span class="ln">4658 </span></a><span class="s0">minutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion</span>
<a name="l4659"><span class="ln">4659 </span></a><span class="s0">deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other</span>
<a name="l4660"><span class="ln">4660 </span></a><span class="s0">recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.</span>
<a name="l4661"><span class="ln">4661 </span></a>
<a name="l4662"><span class="ln">4662 </span></a><span class="s0">The carriage came:  and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on</span>
<a name="l4663"><span class="ln">4663 </span></a><span class="s0">such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l4664"><span class="ln">4664 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some</span>
<a name="l4665"><span class="ln">4665 </span></a><span class="s0">renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen,</span>
<a name="l4666"><span class="ln">4666 </span></a><span class="s0">and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for.</span>
<a name="l4667"><span class="ln">4667 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He was afraid they should have a very bad drive.  He was afraid</span>
<a name="l4668"><span class="ln">4668 </span></a><span class="s0">poor Isabella would not like it.  And there would be poor Emma</span>
<a name="l4669"><span class="ln">4669 </span></a><span class="s0">in the carriage behind.  He did not know what they had best do.</span>
<a name="l4670"><span class="ln">4670 </span></a><span class="s0">They must keep as much together as they could;&quot; and James was talked to,</span>
<a name="l4671"><span class="ln">4671 </span></a><span class="s0">and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.</span>
<a name="l4672"><span class="ln">4672 </span></a>
<a name="l4673"><span class="ln">4673 </span></a><span class="s0">Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he</span>
<a name="l4674"><span class="ln">4674 </span></a><span class="s0">did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;</span>
<a name="l4675"><span class="ln">4675 </span></a><span class="s0">so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second</span>
<a name="l4676"><span class="ln">4676 </span></a><span class="s0">carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,</span>
<a name="l4677"><span class="ln">4677 </span></a><span class="s0">and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive.  It would not have been</span>
<a name="l4678"><span class="ln">4678 </span></a><span class="s0">the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,</span>
<a name="l4679"><span class="ln">4679 </span></a><span class="s0">previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked</span>
<a name="l4680"><span class="ln">4680 </span></a><span class="s0">to him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have</span>
<a name="l4681"><span class="ln">4681 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed but one.  But now, she would rather it had not happened.</span>
<a name="l4682"><span class="ln">4682 </span></a><span class="s0">She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine,</span>
<a name="l4683"><span class="ln">4683 </span></a><span class="s0">and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense.</span>
<a name="l4684"><span class="ln">4684 </span></a>
<a name="l4685"><span class="ln">4685 </span></a><span class="s0">To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was</span>
<a name="l4686"><span class="ln">4686 </span></a><span class="s0">immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity</span>
<a name="l4687"><span class="ln">4687 </span></a><span class="s0">of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had</span>
<a name="l4688"><span class="ln">4688 </span></a><span class="s0">they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she</span>
<a name="l4689"><span class="ln">4689 </span></a><span class="s0">found her subject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded,</span>
<a name="l4690"><span class="ln">4690 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her:  availing himself</span>
<a name="l4691"><span class="ln">4691 </span></a><span class="s0">of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already</span>
<a name="l4692"><span class="ln">4692 </span></a><span class="s0">well known, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him;</span>
<a name="l4693"><span class="ln">4693 </span></a><span class="s0">but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled</span>
<a name="l4694"><span class="ln">4694 </span></a><span class="s0">love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect,</span>
<a name="l4695"><span class="ln">4695 </span></a><span class="s0">and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon</span>
<a name="l4696"><span class="ln">4696 </span></a><span class="s0">as possible.  It really was so.  Without scruple--without apology--</span>
<a name="l4697"><span class="ln">4697 </span></a><span class="s0">without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet,</span>
<a name="l4698"><span class="ln">4698 </span></a><span class="s0">was professing himself _her_ lover.  She tried to stop him; but vainly;</span>
<a name="l4699"><span class="ln">4699 </span></a><span class="s0">he would go on, and say it all.  Angry as she was, the thought of</span>
<a name="l4700"><span class="ln">4700 </span></a><span class="s0">the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak.</span>
<a name="l4701"><span class="ln">4701 </span></a><span class="s0">She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore</span>
<a name="l4702"><span class="ln">4702 </span></a><span class="s0">could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour.</span>
<a name="l4703"><span class="ln">4703 </span></a><span class="s0">Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she</span>
<a name="l4704"><span class="ln">4704 </span></a><span class="s0">hoped would best suit his half and half state, she replied,</span>
<a name="l4705"><span class="ln">4705 </span></a>
<a name="l4706"><span class="ln">4706 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton.  This to _me_! you forget yourself--</span>
<a name="l4707"><span class="ln">4707 </span></a><span class="s0">you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall</span>
<a name="l4708"><span class="ln">4708 </span></a><span class="s0">be happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4709"><span class="ln">4709 </span></a>
<a name="l4710"><span class="ln">4710 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!&quot;--</span>
<a name="l4711"><span class="ln">4711 </span></a><span class="s0">And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful</span>
<a name="l4712"><span class="ln">4712 </span></a><span class="s0">pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,</span>
<a name="l4713"><span class="ln">4713 </span></a>
<a name="l4714"><span class="ln">4714 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account</span>
<a name="l4715"><span class="ln">4715 </span></a><span class="s0">for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak</span>
<a name="l4716"><span class="ln">4716 </span></a><span class="s0">either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner.  Command yourself</span>
<a name="l4717"><span class="ln">4717 </span></a><span class="s0">enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4718"><span class="ln">4718 </span></a>
<a name="l4719"><span class="ln">4719 </span></a><span class="s0">But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits,</span>
<a name="l4720"><span class="ln">4720 </span></a><span class="s0">not at all to confuse his intellects.  He perfectly knew his own meaning;</span>
<a name="l4721"><span class="ln">4721 </span></a><span class="s0">and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious,</span>
<a name="l4722"><span class="ln">4722 </span></a><span class="s0">and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--</span>
<a name="l4723"><span class="ln">4723 </span></a><span class="s0">but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned</span>
<a name="l4724"><span class="ln">4724 </span></a><span class="s0">at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very</span>
<a name="l4725"><span class="ln">4725 </span></a><span class="s0">urgent for a favourable answer.</span>
<a name="l4726"><span class="ln">4726 </span></a>
<a name="l4727"><span class="ln">4727 </span></a><span class="s0">As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy</span>
<a name="l4728"><span class="ln">4728 </span></a><span class="s0">and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,</span>
<a name="l4729"><span class="ln">4729 </span></a>
<a name="l4730"><span class="ln">4730 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.  You have made</span>
<a name="l4731"><span class="ln">4731 </span></a><span class="s0">yourself too clear.  Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond</span>
<a name="l4732"><span class="ln">4732 </span></a><span class="s0">any thing I can express.  After such behaviour, as I have witnessed</span>
<a name="l4733"><span class="ln">4733 </span></a><span class="s0">during the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I</span>
<a name="l4734"><span class="ln">4734 </span></a><span class="s0">have been in the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me</span>
<a name="l4735"><span class="ln">4735 </span></a><span class="s0">in this manner--this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed,</span>
<a name="l4736"><span class="ln">4736 </span></a><span class="s0">which I had not supposed possible!  Believe me, sir, I am far,</span>
<a name="l4737"><span class="ln">4737 </span></a><span class="s0">very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4738"><span class="ln">4738 </span></a>
<a name="l4739"><span class="ln">4739 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Good Heaven!&quot; cried Mr. Elton, &quot;what can be the meaning of this?--</span>
<a name="l4740"><span class="ln">4740 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course</span>
<a name="l4741"><span class="ln">4741 </span></a><span class="s0">of my existence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend:</span>
<a name="l4742"><span class="ln">4742 </span></a><span class="s0">never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend.</span>
<a name="l4743"><span class="ln">4743 </span></a><span class="s0">If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her,</span>
<a name="l4744"><span class="ln">4744 </span></a><span class="s0">and I am very sorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh!</span>
<a name="l4745"><span class="ln">4745 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l4746"><span class="ln">4746 </span></a><span class="s0">is near!  No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character.</span>
<a name="l4747"><span class="ln">4747 </span></a><span class="s0">I have thought only of you.  I protest against having paid the smallest</span>
<a name="l4748"><span class="ln">4748 </span></a><span class="s0">attention to any one else.  Every thing that I have said or done,</span>
<a name="l4749"><span class="ln">4749 </span></a><span class="s0">for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my</span>
<a name="l4750"><span class="ln">4750 </span></a><span class="s0">adoration of yourself.  You cannot really, seriously, doubt it.</span>
<a name="l4751"><span class="ln">4751 </span></a><span class="s0">No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen</span>
<a name="l4752"><span class="ln">4752 </span></a><span class="s0">and understood me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4753"><span class="ln">4753 </span></a>
<a name="l4754"><span class="ln">4754 </span></a><span class="s0">It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--</span>
<a name="l4755"><span class="ln">4755 </span></a><span class="s0">which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost.  She was</span>
<a name="l4756"><span class="ln">4756 </span></a><span class="s0">too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply:</span>
<a name="l4757"><span class="ln">4757 </span></a><span class="s0">and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's</span>
<a name="l4758"><span class="ln">4758 </span></a><span class="s0">sanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he</span>
<a name="l4759"><span class="ln">4759 </span></a><span class="s0">joyously exclaimed--</span>
<a name="l4760"><span class="ln">4760 </span></a>
<a name="l4761"><span class="ln">4761 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence.</span>
<a name="l4762"><span class="ln">4762 </span></a><span class="s0">It confesses that you have long understood me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4763"><span class="ln">4763 </span></a>
<a name="l4764"><span class="ln">4764 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, sir,&quot; cried Emma, &quot;it confesses no such thing.  So far from</span>
<a name="l4765"><span class="ln">4765 </span></a><span class="s0">having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error</span>
<a name="l4766"><span class="ln">4766 </span></a><span class="s0">with respect to your views, till this moment.  As to myself, I am</span>
<a name="l4767"><span class="ln">4767 </span></a><span class="s0">very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings--</span>
<a name="l4768"><span class="ln">4768 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing could be farther from my wishes--your attachment to my</span>
<a name="l4769"><span class="ln">4769 </span></a><span class="s0">friend Harriet--your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me</span>
<a name="l4770"><span class="ln">4770 </span></a><span class="s0">great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success:</span>
<a name="l4771"><span class="ln">4771 </span></a><span class="s0">but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l4772"><span class="ln">4772 </span></a><span class="s0">I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits</span>
<a name="l4773"><span class="ln">4773 </span></a><span class="s0">so frequent.  Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend</span>
<a name="l4774"><span class="ln">4774 </span></a><span class="s0">yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought</span>
<a name="l4775"><span class="ln">4775 </span></a><span class="s0">seriously of her?&quot;</span>
<a name="l4776"><span class="ln">4776 </span></a>
<a name="l4777"><span class="ln">4777 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Never, madam,&quot; cried he, affronted in his turn:  &quot;never, I assure you.</span>
<a name="l4778"><span class="ln">4778 </span></a><span class="s0">_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort</span>
<a name="l4779"><span class="ln">4779 </span></a><span class="s0">of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled.</span>
<a name="l4780"><span class="ln">4780 </span></a><span class="s0">I wish her extremely well:  and, no doubt, there are men who might not</span>
<a name="l4781"><span class="ln">4781 </span></a><span class="s0">object to--Every body has their level:  but as for myself, I am not,</span>
<a name="l4782"><span class="ln">4782 </span></a><span class="s0">I think, quite so much at a loss.  I need not so totally despair</span>
<a name="l4783"><span class="ln">4783 </span></a><span class="s0">of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--</span>
<a name="l4784"><span class="ln">4784 </span></a><span class="s0">No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only;</span>
<a name="l4785"><span class="ln">4785 </span></a><span class="s0">and the encouragement I received--&quot;</span>
<a name="l4786"><span class="ln">4786 </span></a>
<a name="l4787"><span class="ln">4787 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely</span>
<a name="l4788"><span class="ln">4788 </span></a><span class="s0">mistaken in supposing it.  I have seen you only as the admirer</span>
<a name="l4789"><span class="ln">4789 </span></a><span class="s0">of my friend.  In no other light could you have been more to me than</span>
<a name="l4790"><span class="ln">4790 </span></a><span class="s0">a common acquaintance.  I am exceedingly sorry:  but it is well that</span>
<a name="l4791"><span class="ln">4791 </span></a><span class="s0">the mistake ends where it does.  Had the same behaviour continued,</span>
<a name="l4792"><span class="ln">4792 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views;</span>
<a name="l4793"><span class="ln">4793 </span></a><span class="s0">not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very</span>
<a name="l4794"><span class="ln">4794 </span></a><span class="s0">great inequality which you are so sensible of.  But, as it is,</span>
<a name="l4795"><span class="ln">4795 </span></a><span class="s0">the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting.</span>
<a name="l4796"><span class="ln">4796 </span></a><span class="s0">I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4797"><span class="ln">4797 </span></a>
<a name="l4798"><span class="ln">4798 </span></a><span class="s0">He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided</span>
<a name="l4799"><span class="ln">4799 </span></a><span class="s0">to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment,</span>
<a name="l4800"><span class="ln">4800 </span></a><span class="s0">and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few</span>
<a name="l4801"><span class="ln">4801 </span></a><span class="s0">minutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them</span>
<a name="l4802"><span class="ln">4802 </span></a><span class="s0">to a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have</span>
<a name="l4803"><span class="ln">4803 </span></a><span class="s0">been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left</span>
<a name="l4804"><span class="ln">4804 </span></a><span class="s0">no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.  Without knowing</span>
<a name="l4805"><span class="ln">4805 </span></a><span class="s0">when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped,</span>
<a name="l4806"><span class="ln">4806 </span></a><span class="s0">they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house;</span>
<a name="l4807"><span class="ln">4807 </span></a><span class="s0">and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it</span>
<a name="l4808"><span class="ln">4808 </span></a><span class="s0">indispensable to wish him a good night.  The compliment was just returned,</span>
<a name="l4809"><span class="ln">4809 </span></a><span class="s0">coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits,</span>
<a name="l4810"><span class="ln">4810 </span></a><span class="s0">she was then conveyed to Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l4811"><span class="ln">4811 </span></a>
<a name="l4812"><span class="ln">4812 </span></a><span class="s0">There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father,</span>
<a name="l4813"><span class="ln">4813 </span></a><span class="s0">who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from</span>
<a name="l4814"><span class="ln">4814 </span></a><span class="s0">Vicarage Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--</span>
<a name="l4815"><span class="ln">4815 </span></a><span class="s0">and in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it</span>
<a name="l4816"><span class="ln">4816 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well:</span>
<a name="l4817"><span class="ln">4817 </span></a><span class="s0">for Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all</span>
<a name="l4818"><span class="ln">4818 </span></a><span class="s0">kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort</span>
<a name="l4819"><span class="ln">4819 </span></a><span class="s0">of her father, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin</span>
<a name="l4820"><span class="ln">4820 </span></a><span class="s0">of gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome;</span>
<a name="l4821"><span class="ln">4821 </span></a><span class="s0">and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,</span>
<a name="l4822"><span class="ln">4822 </span></a><span class="s0">except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation;</span>
<a name="l4823"><span class="ln">4823 </span></a><span class="s0">and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till</span>

<a name="l4829"><span class="ln">4829 </span></a>
<a name="l4830"><span class="ln">4830 </span></a>
<a name="l4831"><span class="ln">4831 </span></a><span class="s0">The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think</span>
<a name="l4832"><span class="ln">4832 </span></a><span class="s0">and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow</span>
<a name="l4833"><span class="ln">4833 </span></a><span class="s0">of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every</span>
<a name="l4834"><span class="ln">4834 </span></a><span class="s0">thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst</span>
<a name="l4835"><span class="ln">4835 </span></a><span class="s0">of all.  Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort</span>
<a name="l4836"><span class="ln">4836 </span></a><span class="s0">or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light;</span>
<a name="l4837"><span class="ln">4837 </span></a><span class="s0">and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--</span>
<a name="l4838"><span class="ln">4838 </span></a><span class="s0">more in error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was,</span>
<a name="l4839"><span class="ln">4839 </span></a><span class="s0">could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.</span>
<a name="l4840"><span class="ln">4840 </span></a>
<a name="l4841"><span class="ln">4841 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have</span>
<a name="l4842"><span class="ln">4842 </span></a><span class="s0">borne any thing.  He might have doubled his presumption to me--</span>
<a name="l4843"><span class="ln">4843 </span></a><span class="s0">but poor Harriet!&quot;</span>
<a name="l4844"><span class="ln">4844 </span></a>
<a name="l4845"><span class="ln">4845 </span></a><span class="s0">How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he</span>
<a name="l4846"><span class="ln">4846 </span></a><span class="s0">had never thought seriously of Harriet--never!  She looked back</span>
<a name="l4847"><span class="ln">4847 </span></a><span class="s0">as well as she could; but it was all confusion.  She had taken</span>
<a name="l4848"><span class="ln">4848 </span></a><span class="s0">up the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it.</span>
<a name="l4849"><span class="ln">4849 </span></a><span class="s0">His manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious,</span>
<a name="l4850"><span class="ln">4850 </span></a><span class="s0">or she could not have been so misled.</span>
<a name="l4851"><span class="ln">4851 </span></a>
<a name="l4852"><span class="ln">4852 </span></a><span class="s0">The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--</span>
<a name="l4853"><span class="ln">4853 </span></a><span class="s0">and the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--</span>
<a name="l4854"><span class="ln">4854 </span></a><span class="s0">how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet.  To be sure,</span>
<a name="l4855"><span class="ln">4855 </span></a><span class="s0">the charade, with its &quot;ready wit&quot;--but then the &quot;soft eyes&quot;--</span>
<a name="l4856"><span class="ln">4856 </span></a><span class="s0">in fact it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth.</span>
<a name="l4857"><span class="ln">4857 </span></a><span class="s0">Who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense?</span>
<a name="l4858"><span class="ln">4858 </span></a>
<a name="l4859"><span class="ln">4859 </span></a><span class="s0">Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners</span>
<a name="l4860"><span class="ln">4860 </span></a><span class="s0">to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way,</span>
<a name="l4861"><span class="ln">4861 </span></a><span class="s0">as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof</span>
<a name="l4862"><span class="ln">4862 </span></a><span class="s0">among others that he had not always lived in the best society,</span>
<a name="l4863"><span class="ln">4863 </span></a><span class="s0">that with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance</span>
<a name="l4864"><span class="ln">4864 </span></a><span class="s0">was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never,</span>
<a name="l4865"><span class="ln">4865 </span></a><span class="s0">for an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect</span>
<a name="l4866"><span class="ln">4866 </span></a><span class="s0">to her as Harriet's friend.</span>
<a name="l4867"><span class="ln">4867 </span></a>
<a name="l4868"><span class="ln">4868 </span></a><span class="s0">To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on</span>
<a name="l4869"><span class="ln">4869 </span></a><span class="s0">the subject, for the first start of its possibility.  There was</span>
<a name="l4870"><span class="ln">4870 </span></a><span class="s0">no denying that those brothers had penetration.  She remembered</span>
<a name="l4871"><span class="ln">4871 </span></a><span class="s0">what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution</span>
<a name="l4872"><span class="ln">4872 </span></a><span class="s0">he had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would</span>
<a name="l4873"><span class="ln">4873 </span></a><span class="s0">never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer</span>
<a name="l4874"><span class="ln">4874 </span></a><span class="s0">a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she</span>
<a name="l4875"><span class="ln">4875 </span></a><span class="s0">had reached herself.  It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l4876"><span class="ln">4876 </span></a><span class="s0">was proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she</span>
<a name="l4877"><span class="ln">4877 </span></a><span class="s0">had meant and believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full</span>
<a name="l4878"><span class="ln">4878 </span></a><span class="s0">of his own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.</span>
<a name="l4879"><span class="ln">4879 </span></a>
<a name="l4880"><span class="ln">4880 </span></a><span class="s0">Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting</span>
<a name="l4881"><span class="ln">4881 </span></a><span class="s0">to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion.</span>
<a name="l4882"><span class="ln">4882 </span></a><span class="s0">His professions and his proposals did him no service.  She thought</span>
<a name="l4883"><span class="ln">4883 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing of his attachment, and was insulted by his hopes.</span>
<a name="l4884"><span class="ln">4884 </span></a><span class="s0">He wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his</span>
<a name="l4885"><span class="ln">4885 </span></a><span class="s0">eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy</span>
<a name="l4886"><span class="ln">4886 </span></a><span class="s0">as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for.</span>
<a name="l4887"><span class="ln">4887 </span></a><span class="s0">There had been no real affection either in his language or manners.</span>
<a name="l4888"><span class="ln">4888 </span></a><span class="s0">Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could</span>
<a name="l4889"><span class="ln">4889 </span></a><span class="s0">hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,</span>
<a name="l4890"><span class="ln">4890 </span></a><span class="s0">less allied with real love.  She need not trouble herself to pity him.</span>
<a name="l4891"><span class="ln">4891 </span></a><span class="s0">He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l4892"><span class="ln">4892 </span></a><span class="s0">of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite</span>
<a name="l4893"><span class="ln">4893 </span></a><span class="s0">so easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss</span>
<a name="l4894"><span class="ln">4894 </span></a><span class="s0">Somebody else with twenty, or with ten.</span>
<a name="l4895"><span class="ln">4895 </span></a>
<a name="l4896"><span class="ln">4896 </span></a><span class="s0">But--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as</span>
<a name="l4897"><span class="ln">4897 </span></a><span class="s0">aware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short),</span>
<a name="l4898"><span class="ln">4898 </span></a><span class="s0">to marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion</span>
<a name="l4899"><span class="ln">4899 </span></a><span class="s0">or mind!--look down upon her friend, so well understanding the</span>
<a name="l4900"><span class="ln">4900 </span></a><span class="s0">gradations of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above,</span>
<a name="l4901"><span class="ln">4901 </span></a><span class="s0">as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!--</span>
<a name="l4902"><span class="ln">4902 </span></a><span class="s0">It was most provoking.</span>
<a name="l4903"><span class="ln">4903 </span></a>
<a name="l4904"><span class="ln">4904 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he</span>
<a name="l4905"><span class="ln">4905 </span></a><span class="s0">was her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind.</span>
<a name="l4906"><span class="ln">4906 </span></a><span class="s0">The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it;</span>
<a name="l4907"><span class="ln">4907 </span></a><span class="s0">but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly</span>
<a name="l4908"><span class="ln">4908 </span></a><span class="s0">his superior.  He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled</span>
<a name="l4909"><span class="ln">4909 </span></a><span class="s0">for several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch</span>
<a name="l4910"><span class="ln">4910 </span></a><span class="s0">of a very ancient family--and that the Eltons were nobody.</span>
<a name="l4911"><span class="ln">4911 </span></a><span class="s0">The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable,</span>
<a name="l4912"><span class="ln">4912 </span></a><span class="s0">being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all</span>
<a name="l4913"><span class="ln">4913 </span></a><span class="s0">the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources,</span>
<a name="l4914"><span class="ln">4914 </span></a><span class="s0">was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself,</span>
<a name="l4915"><span class="ln">4915 </span></a><span class="s0">in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long</span>
<a name="l4916"><span class="ln">4916 </span></a><span class="s0">held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which</span>
<a name="l4917"><span class="ln">4917 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way</span>
<a name="l4918"><span class="ln">4918 </span></a><span class="s0">as he could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing</span>
<a name="l4919"><span class="ln">4919 </span></a><span class="s0">to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.--</span>
<a name="l4920"><span class="ln">4920 </span></a><span class="s0">But he had fancied her in love with him; that evidently must</span>
<a name="l4921"><span class="ln">4921 </span></a><span class="s0">have been his dependence; and after raving a little about the</span>
<a name="l4922"><span class="ln">4922 </span></a><span class="s0">seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head,</span>
<a name="l4923"><span class="ln">4923 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own</span>
<a name="l4924"><span class="ln">4924 </span></a><span class="s0">behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of</span>
<a name="l4925"><span class="ln">4925 </span></a><span class="s0">courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real motive unperceived)</span>
<a name="l4926"><span class="ln">4926 </span></a><span class="s0">might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy,</span>
<a name="l4927"><span class="ln">4927 </span></a><span class="s0">like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.  If _she_</span>
<a name="l4928"><span class="ln">4928 </span></a><span class="s0">had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder</span>
<a name="l4929"><span class="ln">4929 </span></a><span class="s0">that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers.</span>
<a name="l4930"><span class="ln">4930 </span></a>
<a name="l4931"><span class="ln">4931 </span></a><span class="s0">The first error and the worst lay at her door.  It was foolish,</span>
<a name="l4932"><span class="ln">4932 </span></a><span class="s0">it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two</span>
<a name="l4933"><span class="ln">4933 </span></a><span class="s0">people together.  It was adventuring too far, assuming too much,</span>
<a name="l4934"><span class="ln">4934 </span></a><span class="s0">making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought</span>
<a name="l4935"><span class="ln">4935 </span></a><span class="s0">to be simple.  She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved</span>
<a name="l4936"><span class="ln">4936 </span></a><span class="s0">to do such things no more.</span>
<a name="l4937"><span class="ln">4937 </span></a>
<a name="l4938"><span class="ln">4938 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Here have I,&quot; said she, &quot;actually talked poor Harriet into being</span>
<a name="l4939"><span class="ln">4939 </span></a><span class="s0">very much attached to this man.  She might never have thought of him</span>
<a name="l4940"><span class="ln">4940 </span></a><span class="s0">but for me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope,</span>
<a name="l4941"><span class="ln">4941 </span></a><span class="s0">if I had not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest</span>
<a name="l4942"><span class="ln">4942 </span></a><span class="s0">and humble as I used to think him.  Oh! that I had been satisfied with</span>
<a name="l4943"><span class="ln">4943 </span></a><span class="s0">persuading her not to accept young Martin.  There I was quite right.</span>
<a name="l4944"><span class="ln">4944 </span></a><span class="s0">That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left</span>
<a name="l4945"><span class="ln">4945 </span></a><span class="s0">the rest to time and chance.  I was introducing her into good company,</span>
<a name="l4946"><span class="ln">4946 </span></a><span class="s0">and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having;</span>
<a name="l4947"><span class="ln">4947 </span></a><span class="s0">I ought not to have attempted more.  But now, poor girl, her peace</span>
<a name="l4948"><span class="ln">4948 </span></a><span class="s0">is cut up for some time.  I have been but half a friend to her;</span>
<a name="l4949"><span class="ln">4949 </span></a><span class="s0">and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much, I am</span>
<a name="l4950"><span class="ln">4950 </span></a><span class="s0">sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable</span>
<a name="l4951"><span class="ln">4951 </span></a><span class="s0">for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I could not endure William Coxe--</span>
<a name="l4952"><span class="ln">4952 </span></a><span class="s0">a pert young lawyer.&quot;</span>
<a name="l4953"><span class="ln">4953 </span></a>
<a name="l4954"><span class="ln">4954 </span></a><span class="s0">She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed</span>
<a name="l4955"><span class="ln">4955 </span></a><span class="s0">a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been,</span>
<a name="l4956"><span class="ln">4956 </span></a><span class="s0">and might be, and must be.  The distressing explanation she had</span>
<a name="l4957"><span class="ln">4957 </span></a><span class="s0">to make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering,</span>
<a name="l4958"><span class="ln">4958 </span></a><span class="s0">with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of</span>
<a name="l4959"><span class="ln">4959 </span></a><span class="s0">continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings,</span>
<a name="l4960"><span class="ln">4960 </span></a><span class="s0">concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy</span>
<a name="l4961"><span class="ln">4961 </span></a><span class="s0">her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went</span>
<a name="l4962"><span class="ln">4962 </span></a><span class="s0">to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having</span>
<a name="l4963"><span class="ln">4963 </span></a><span class="s0">blundered most dreadfully.</span>
<a name="l4964"><span class="ln">4964 </span></a>
<a name="l4965"><span class="ln">4965 </span></a><span class="s0">To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under</span>
<a name="l4966"><span class="ln">4966 </span></a><span class="s0">temporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail</span>
<a name="l4967"><span class="ln">4967 </span></a><span class="s0">to bring return of spirits.  The youth and cheerfulness of morning</span>
<a name="l4968"><span class="ln">4968 </span></a><span class="s0">are in happy analogy, and of powerful operation; and if the</span>
<a name="l4969"><span class="ln">4969 </span></a><span class="s0">distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed, they</span>
<a name="l4970"><span class="ln">4970 </span></a><span class="s0">will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope.</span>
<a name="l4971"><span class="ln">4971 </span></a>
<a name="l4972"><span class="ln">4972 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had</span>
<a name="l4973"><span class="ln">4973 </span></a><span class="s0">gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her,</span>
<a name="l4974"><span class="ln">4974 </span></a><span class="s0">and to depend on getting tolerably out of it.</span>
<a name="l4975"><span class="ln">4975 </span></a>
<a name="l4976"><span class="ln">4976 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really</span>
<a name="l4977"><span class="ln">4977 </span></a><span class="s0">in love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking</span>
<a name="l4978"><span class="ln">4978 </span></a><span class="s0">to disappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that</span>
<a name="l4979"><span class="ln">4979 </span></a><span class="s0">superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--</span>
<a name="l4980"><span class="ln">4980 </span></a><span class="s0">and that there could be no necessity for any body's knowing</span>
<a name="l4981"><span class="ln">4981 </span></a><span class="s0">what had passed except the three principals, and especially</span>
<a name="l4982"><span class="ln">4982 </span></a><span class="s0">for her father's being given a moment's uneasiness about it.</span>
<a name="l4983"><span class="ln">4983 </span></a>
<a name="l4984"><span class="ln">4984 </span></a><span class="s0">These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal</span>
<a name="l4985"><span class="ln">4985 </span></a><span class="s0">of snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was</span>
<a name="l4986"><span class="ln">4986 </span></a><span class="s0">welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder</span>
<a name="l4987"><span class="ln">4987 </span></a><span class="s0">at present.</span>
<a name="l4988"><span class="ln">4988 </span></a>
<a name="l4989"><span class="ln">4989 </span></a><span class="s0">The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day,</span>
<a name="l4990"><span class="ln">4990 </span></a><span class="s0">she could not go to church.  Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable</span>
<a name="l4991"><span class="ln">4991 </span></a><span class="s0">had his daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from</span>
<a name="l4992"><span class="ln">4992 </span></a><span class="s0">either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas.</span>
<a name="l4993"><span class="ln">4993 </span></a><span class="s0">The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled</span>
<a name="l4994"><span class="ln">4994 </span></a><span class="s0">state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most</span>
<a name="l4995"><span class="ln">4995 </span></a><span class="s0">unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow,</span>
<a name="l4996"><span class="ln">4996 </span></a><span class="s0">and every evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most</span>
<a name="l4997"><span class="ln">4997 </span></a><span class="s0">honourable prisoner.  No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note;</span>
<a name="l4998"><span class="ln">4998 </span></a><span class="s0">no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no</span>
<a name="l4999"><span class="ln">4999 </span></a><span class="s0">need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting himself.</span>
<a name="l5000"><span class="ln">5000 </span></a>
<a name="l5001"><span class="ln">5001 </span></a><span class="s0">It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home;</span>

<a name="l5003"><span class="ln">5003 </span></a><span class="s0">in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father</span>
<a name="l5004"><span class="ln">5004 </span></a><span class="s0">so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house,</span>
<a name="l5005"><span class="ln">5005 </span></a><span class="s0">too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no</span>
<a name="l5006"><span class="ln">5006 </span></a><span class="s0">weather could keep entirely from them,--</span>
<a name="l5007"><span class="ln">5007 </span></a>
<a name="l5008"><span class="ln">5008 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!  Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?&quot;</span>
<a name="l5009"><span class="ln">5009 </span></a>
<a name="l5010"><span class="ln">5010 </span></a><span class="s0">These days of confinement would have been, but for her private</span>
<a name="l5011"><span class="ln">5011 </span></a><span class="s0">perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly</span>
<a name="l5012"><span class="ln">5012 </span></a><span class="s0">suited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance</span>
<a name="l5013"><span class="ln">5013 </span></a><span class="s0">to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off</span>
<a name="l5014"><span class="ln">5014 </span></a><span class="s0">his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him</span>
<a name="l5015"><span class="ln">5015 </span></a><span class="s0">during the rest of his stay at Hartfield.  He was always agreeable</span>
<a name="l5016"><span class="ln">5016 </span></a><span class="s0">and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.  But with all</span>
<a name="l5017"><span class="ln">5017 </span></a><span class="s0">the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay,</span>
<a name="l5018"><span class="ln">5018 </span></a><span class="s0">there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation</span>
<a name="l5019"><span class="ln">5019 </span></a><span class="s0">with Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.</span>

<a name="l5026"><span class="ln">5026 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l5027"><span class="ln">5027 </span></a><span class="s0">The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move;</span>
<a name="l5028"><span class="ln">5028 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter</span>
<a name="l5029"><span class="ln">5029 </span></a><span class="s0">to stay behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole</span>
<a name="l5030"><span class="ln">5030 </span></a><span class="s0">party set off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny</span>
<a name="l5031"><span class="ln">5031 </span></a><span class="s0">of poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with</span>
<a name="l5032"><span class="ln">5032 </span></a><span class="s0">those she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults,</span>
<a name="l5033"><span class="ln">5033 </span></a><span class="s0">and always innocently busy, might have been a model of right</span>
<a name="l5034"><span class="ln">5034 </span></a><span class="s0">feminine happiness.</span>
<a name="l5035"><span class="ln">5035 </span></a>
<a name="l5036"><span class="ln">5036 </span></a><span class="s0">The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note</span>
<a name="l5037"><span class="ln">5037 </span></a><span class="s0">from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note,</span>
<a name="l5038"><span class="ln">5038 </span></a><span class="s0">to say, with Mr. Elton's best compliments, &quot;that he was proposing</span>
<a name="l5039"><span class="ln">5039 </span></a><span class="s0">to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath;</span>
<a name="l5040"><span class="ln">5040 </span></a><span class="s0">where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends,</span>
<a name="l5041"><span class="ln">5041 </span></a><span class="s0">he had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted</span>
<a name="l5042"><span class="ln">5042 </span></a><span class="s0">the impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of</span>
<a name="l5043"><span class="ln">5043 </span></a><span class="s0">weather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l5044"><span class="ln">5044 </span></a><span class="s0">of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense--</span>
<a name="l5045"><span class="ln">5045 </span></a><span class="s0">and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5046"><span class="ln">5046 </span></a>
<a name="l5047"><span class="ln">5047 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just</span>
<a name="l5048"><span class="ln">5048 </span></a><span class="s0">at this time was the very thing to be desired.  She admired</span>
<a name="l5049"><span class="ln">5049 </span></a><span class="s0">him for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit</span>
<a name="l5050"><span class="ln">5050 </span></a><span class="s0">for the manner in which it was announced.  Resentment could not</span>
<a name="l5051"><span class="ln">5051 </span></a><span class="s0">have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father,</span>
<a name="l5052"><span class="ln">5052 </span></a><span class="s0">from which she was so pointedly excluded.  She had not even a</span>
<a name="l5053"><span class="ln">5053 </span></a><span class="s0">share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not mentioned;--</span>
<a name="l5054"><span class="ln">5054 </span></a><span class="s0">and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an</span>
<a name="l5055"><span class="ln">5055 </span></a><span class="s0">ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,</span>
<a name="l5056"><span class="ln">5056 </span></a><span class="s0">as she thought, at first, could not escape her father's suspicion.</span>
<a name="l5057"><span class="ln">5057 </span></a>
<a name="l5058"><span class="ln">5058 </span></a><span class="s0">It did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize</span>
<a name="l5059"><span class="ln">5059 </span></a><span class="s0">of so sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get</span>
<a name="l5060"><span class="ln">5060 </span></a><span class="s0">safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language.</span>
<a name="l5061"><span class="ln">5061 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter</span>
<a name="l5062"><span class="ln">5062 </span></a><span class="s0">for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening.</span>
<a name="l5063"><span class="ln">5063 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits</span>
<a name="l5064"><span class="ln">5064 </span></a><span class="s0">to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.</span>
<a name="l5065"><span class="ln">5065 </span></a>
<a name="l5066"><span class="ln">5066 </span></a><span class="s0">She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark.  She had</span>
<a name="l5067"><span class="ln">5067 </span></a><span class="s0">reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was</span>
<a name="l5068"><span class="ln">5068 </span></a><span class="s0">desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting</span>
<a name="l5069"><span class="ln">5069 </span></a><span class="s0">the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return.</span>
<a name="l5070"><span class="ln">5070 </span></a><span class="s0">She went to Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo</span>
<a name="l5071"><span class="ln">5071 </span></a><span class="s0">the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--</span>
<a name="l5072"><span class="ln">5072 </span></a><span class="s0">She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously</span>
<a name="l5073"><span class="ln">5073 </span></a><span class="s0">feeding--to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred--</span>
<a name="l5074"><span class="ln">5074 </span></a><span class="s0">and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her</span>
<a name="l5075"><span class="ln">5075 </span></a><span class="s0">ideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions,</span>
<a name="l5076"><span class="ln">5076 </span></a><span class="s0">all her prophecies for the last six weeks.</span>
<a name="l5077"><span class="ln">5077 </span></a>
<a name="l5078"><span class="ln">5078 </span></a><span class="s0">The confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight</span>
<a name="l5079"><span class="ln">5079 </span></a><span class="s0">of Harriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity</span>
<a name="l5080"><span class="ln">5080 </span></a><span class="s0">with herself again.</span>
<a name="l5081"><span class="ln">5081 </span></a>
<a name="l5082"><span class="ln">5082 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--</span>
<a name="l5083"><span class="ln">5083 </span></a><span class="s0">and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition</span>
<a name="l5084"><span class="ln">5084 </span></a><span class="s0">and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular</span>
<a name="l5085"><span class="ln">5085 </span></a><span class="s0">advantage at that moment to her friend.</span>
<a name="l5086"><span class="ln">5086 </span></a>
<a name="l5087"><span class="ln">5087 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;</span>
<a name="l5088"><span class="ln">5088 </span></a><span class="s0">and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching,</span>
<a name="l5089"><span class="ln">5089 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed on Harriet's side, not her own.  Harriet did not consider</span>
<a name="l5090"><span class="ln">5090 </span></a><span class="s0">herself as having any thing to complain of.  The affection of such</span>
<a name="l5091"><span class="ln">5091 </span></a><span class="s0">a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.--</span>
<a name="l5092"><span class="ln">5092 </span></a><span class="s0">She never could have deserved him--and nobody but so partial</span>
<a name="l5093"><span class="ln">5093 </span></a><span class="s0">and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.</span>
<a name="l5094"><span class="ln">5094 </span></a>
<a name="l5095"><span class="ln">5095 </span></a><span class="s0">Her tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless,</span>
<a name="l5096"><span class="ln">5096 </span></a><span class="s0">that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes--</span>
<a name="l5097"><span class="ln">5097 </span></a><span class="s0">and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart</span>
<a name="l5098"><span class="ln">5098 </span></a><span class="s0">and understanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was</span>
<a name="l5099"><span class="ln">5099 </span></a><span class="s0">the superior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would</span>
<a name="l5100"><span class="ln">5100 </span></a><span class="s0">be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or</span>
<a name="l5101"><span class="ln">5101 </span></a><span class="s0">intelligence could do.</span>
<a name="l5102"><span class="ln">5102 </span></a>
<a name="l5103"><span class="ln">5103 </span></a><span class="s0">It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded</span>
<a name="l5104"><span class="ln">5104 </span></a><span class="s0">and ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution</span>
<a name="l5105"><span class="ln">5105 </span></a><span class="s0">confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination</span>
<a name="l5106"><span class="ln">5106 </span></a><span class="s0">all the rest of her life.  Her second duty now, inferior only to her</span>
<a name="l5107"><span class="ln">5107 </span></a><span class="s0">father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour</span>
<a name="l5108"><span class="ln">5108 </span></a><span class="s0">to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making.</span>
<a name="l5109"><span class="ln">5109 </span></a><span class="s0">She got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness,</span>
<a name="l5110"><span class="ln">5110 </span></a><span class="s0">striving to occupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation,</span>
<a name="l5111"><span class="ln">5111 </span></a><span class="s0">to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.</span>
<a name="l5112"><span class="ln">5112 </span></a>
<a name="l5113"><span class="ln">5113 </span></a><span class="s0">Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she</span>
<a name="l5114"><span class="ln">5114 </span></a><span class="s0">could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general,</span>
<a name="l5115"><span class="ln">5115 </span></a><span class="s0">and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l5116"><span class="ln">5116 </span></a><span class="s0">in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age,</span>
<a name="l5117"><span class="ln">5117 </span></a><span class="s0">and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be</span>
<a name="l5118"><span class="ln">5118 </span></a><span class="s0">made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return,</span>
<a name="l5119"><span class="ln">5119 </span></a><span class="s0">as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,</span>
<a name="l5120"><span class="ln">5120 </span></a><span class="s0">without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.</span>
<a name="l5121"><span class="ln">5121 </span></a>
<a name="l5122"><span class="ln">5122 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence</span>
<a name="l5123"><span class="ln">5123 </span></a><span class="s0">of any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,</span>
<a name="l5124"><span class="ln">5124 </span></a><span class="s0">prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen;</span>
<a name="l5125"><span class="ln">5125 </span></a><span class="s0">but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive</span>
<a name="l5126"><span class="ln">5126 </span></a><span class="s0">against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not</span>
<a name="l5127"><span class="ln">5127 </span></a><span class="s0">comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.</span>
<a name="l5128"><span class="ln">5128 </span></a>
<a name="l5129"><span class="ln">5129 </span></a><span class="s0">If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident</span>
<a name="l5130"><span class="ln">5130 </span></a><span class="s0">and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do,</span>
<a name="l5131"><span class="ln">5131 </span></a><span class="s0">she could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness</span>
<a name="l5132"><span class="ln">5132 </span></a><span class="s0">in the sight or the recollection of him.</span>
<a name="l5133"><span class="ln">5133 </span></a>
<a name="l5134"><span class="ln">5134 </span></a><span class="s0">Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad</span>
<a name="l5135"><span class="ln">5135 </span></a><span class="s0">for each, for all three.  Not one of them had the power of removal,</span>
<a name="l5136"><span class="ln">5136 </span></a><span class="s0">or of effecting any material change of society.  They must encounter</span>
<a name="l5137"><span class="ln">5137 </span></a><span class="s0">each other, and make the best of it.</span>
<a name="l5138"><span class="ln">5138 </span></a>
<a name="l5139"><span class="ln">5139 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at</span>
<a name="l5140"><span class="ln">5140 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers</span>
<a name="l5141"><span class="ln">5141 </span></a><span class="s0">and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only</span>
<a name="l5142"><span class="ln">5142 </span></a><span class="s0">that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling</span>
<a name="l5143"><span class="ln">5143 </span></a><span class="s0">moderation or repellent truth.  Where the wound had been given,</span>
<a name="l5144"><span class="ln">5144 </span></a><span class="s0">there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that,</span>
<a name="l5145"><span class="ln">5145 </span></a><span class="s0">till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace</span>
<a name="l5146"><span class="ln">5146 </span></a><span class="s0">for herself.</span>

<a name="l5152"><span class="ln">5152 </span></a>
<a name="l5153"><span class="ln">5153 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Frank Churchill did not come.  When the time proposed</span>
<a name="l5154"><span class="ln">5154 </span></a><span class="s0">drew near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival</span>
<a name="l5155"><span class="ln">5155 </span></a><span class="s0">of a letter of excuse.  For the present, he could not be spared,</span>
<a name="l5156"><span class="ln">5156 </span></a><span class="s0">to his &quot;very great mortification and regret; but still he looked</span>
<a name="l5157"><span class="ln">5157 </span></a><span class="s0">forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5158"><span class="ln">5158 </span></a>
<a name="l5159"><span class="ln">5159 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed,</span>
<a name="l5160"><span class="ln">5160 </span></a><span class="s0">in fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the</span>
<a name="l5161"><span class="ln">5161 </span></a><span class="s0">young man had been so much more sober:  but a sanguine temper,</span>
<a name="l5162"><span class="ln">5162 </span></a><span class="s0">though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not</span>
<a name="l5163"><span class="ln">5163 </span></a><span class="s0">always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression.</span>
<a name="l5164"><span class="ln">5164 </span></a><span class="s0">It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again.</span>
<a name="l5165"><span class="ln">5165 </span></a><span class="s0">For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he</span>
<a name="l5166"><span class="ln">5166 </span></a><span class="s0">began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three months later</span>
<a name="l5167"><span class="ln">5167 </span></a><span class="s0">would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather;</span>
<a name="l5168"><span class="ln">5168 </span></a><span class="s0">and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably</span>
<a name="l5169"><span class="ln">5169 </span></a><span class="s0">longer with them than if he had come sooner.</span>
<a name="l5170"><span class="ln">5170 </span></a>
<a name="l5171"><span class="ln">5171 </span></a><span class="s0">These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l5172"><span class="ln">5172 </span></a><span class="s0">of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition</span>
<a name="l5173"><span class="ln">5173 </span></a><span class="s0">of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband</span>
<a name="l5174"><span class="ln">5174 </span></a><span class="s0">was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.</span>
<a name="l5175"><span class="ln">5175 </span></a>
<a name="l5176"><span class="ln">5176 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really</span>
<a name="l5177"><span class="ln">5177 </span></a><span class="s0">about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment</span>
<a name="l5178"><span class="ln">5178 </span></a><span class="s0">at Randalls.  The acquaintance at present had no charm for her.</span>
<a name="l5179"><span class="ln">5179 </span></a><span class="s0">She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it</span>
<a name="l5180"><span class="ln">5180 </span></a><span class="s0">was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self,</span>
<a name="l5181"><span class="ln">5181 </span></a><span class="s0">she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance,</span>
<a name="l5182"><span class="ln">5182 </span></a><span class="s0">and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment,</span>
<a name="l5183"><span class="ln">5183 </span></a><span class="s0">as might naturally belong to their friendship.</span>
<a name="l5184"><span class="ln">5184 </span></a>
<a name="l5185"><span class="ln">5185 </span></a><span class="s0">She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed</span>
<a name="l5186"><span class="ln">5186 </span></a><span class="s0">quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps</span>
<a name="l5187"><span class="ln">5187 </span></a><span class="s0">rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away.</span>
<a name="l5188"><span class="ln">5188 </span></a><span class="s0">She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the</span>
<a name="l5189"><span class="ln">5189 </span></a><span class="s0">advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry;</span>
<a name="l5190"><span class="ln">5190 </span></a><span class="s0">the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire,</span>
<a name="l5191"><span class="ln">5191 </span></a><span class="s0">which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections</span>
<a name="l5192"><span class="ln">5192 </span></a><span class="s0">on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a</span>
<a name="l5193"><span class="ln">5193 </span></a><span class="s0">disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement,</span>
<a name="l5194"><span class="ln">5194 </span></a><span class="s0">perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her</span>
<a name="l5195"><span class="ln">5195 </span></a><span class="s0">real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.</span>
<a name="l5196"><span class="ln">5196 </span></a>
<a name="l5197"><span class="ln">5197 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The Churchills are very likely in fault,&quot; said Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l5198"><span class="ln">5198 </span></a><span class="s0">coolly; &quot;but I dare say he might come if he would.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5199"><span class="ln">5199 </span></a>
<a name="l5200"><span class="ln">5200 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not know why you should say so.  He wishes exceedingly to come;</span>
<a name="l5201"><span class="ln">5201 </span></a><span class="s0">but his uncle and aunt will not spare him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5202"><span class="ln">5202 </span></a>
<a name="l5203"><span class="ln">5203 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made</span>
<a name="l5204"><span class="ln">5204 </span></a><span class="s0">a point of it.  It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5205"><span class="ln">5205 </span></a>
<a name="l5206"><span class="ln">5206 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How odd you are!  What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you</span>
<a name="l5207"><span class="ln">5207 </span></a><span class="s0">suppose him such an unnatural creature?&quot;</span>
<a name="l5208"><span class="ln">5208 </span></a>
<a name="l5209"><span class="ln">5209 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting</span>
<a name="l5210"><span class="ln">5210 </span></a><span class="s0">that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care</span>
<a name="l5211"><span class="ln">5211 </span></a><span class="s0">very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with</span>
<a name="l5212"><span class="ln">5212 </span></a><span class="s0">those who have always set him the example of it.  It is a great deal</span>
<a name="l5213"><span class="ln">5213 </span></a><span class="s0">more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up</span>
<a name="l5214"><span class="ln">5214 </span></a><span class="s0">by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud,</span>
<a name="l5215"><span class="ln">5215 </span></a><span class="s0">luxurious, and selfish too.  If Frank Churchill had wanted to see</span>
<a name="l5216"><span class="ln">5216 </span></a><span class="s0">his father, he would have contrived it between September and January.</span>
<a name="l5217"><span class="ln">5217 </span></a><span class="s0">A man at his age--what is he?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be</span>
<a name="l5218"><span class="ln">5218 </span></a><span class="s0">without the means of doing as much as that.  It is impossible.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5219"><span class="ln">5219 </span></a>
<a name="l5220"><span class="ln">5220 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always</span>
<a name="l5221"><span class="ln">5221 </span></a><span class="s0">been your own master.  You are the worst judge in the world,</span>
<a name="l5222"><span class="ln">5222 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence.  You do not know</span>
<a name="l5223"><span class="ln">5223 </span></a><span class="s0">what it is to have tempers to manage.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5224"><span class="ln">5224 </span></a>
<a name="l5225"><span class="ln">5225 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty</span>
<a name="l5226"><span class="ln">5226 </span></a><span class="s0">should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount.  He cannot</span>
<a name="l5227"><span class="ln">5227 </span></a><span class="s0">want money--he cannot want leisure.  We know, on the contrary,</span>
<a name="l5228"><span class="ln">5228 </span></a><span class="s0">that he has so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at</span>
<a name="l5229"><span class="ln">5229 </span></a><span class="s0">the idlest haunts in the kingdom.  We hear of him for ever at some</span>
<a name="l5230"><span class="ln">5230 </span></a><span class="s0">watering-place or other.  A little while ago, he was at Weymouth.</span>
<a name="l5231"><span class="ln">5231 </span></a><span class="s0">This proves that he can leave the Churchills.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5232"><span class="ln">5232 </span></a>
<a name="l5233"><span class="ln">5233 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sometimes he can.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5234"><span class="ln">5234 </span></a>
<a name="l5235"><span class="ln">5235 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while;</span>
<a name="l5236"><span class="ln">5236 </span></a><span class="s0">whenever there is any temptation of pleasure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5237"><span class="ln">5237 </span></a>
<a name="l5238"><span class="ln">5238 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an</span>
<a name="l5239"><span class="ln">5239 </span></a><span class="s0">intimate knowledge of their situation.  Nobody, who has not been</span>
<a name="l5240"><span class="ln">5240 </span></a><span class="s0">in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties</span>
<a name="l5241"><span class="ln">5241 </span></a><span class="s0">of any individual of that family may be.  We ought to be</span>
<a name="l5242"><span class="ln">5242 </span></a><span class="s0">acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill's temper,</span>
<a name="l5243"><span class="ln">5243 </span></a><span class="s0">before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do.</span>
<a name="l5244"><span class="ln">5244 </span></a><span class="s0">He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5245"><span class="ln">5245 </span></a>
<a name="l5246"><span class="ln">5246 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses,</span>
<a name="l5247"><span class="ln">5247 </span></a><span class="s0">and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour</span>
<a name="l5248"><span class="ln">5248 </span></a><span class="s0">and resolution.  It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention</span>
<a name="l5249"><span class="ln">5249 </span></a><span class="s0">to his father.  He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages;</span>
<a name="l5250"><span class="ln">5250 </span></a><span class="s0">but if he wished to do it, it might be done.  A man who felt rightly</span>
<a name="l5251"><span class="ln">5251 </span></a><span class="s0">would say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--</span>
<a name="l5252"><span class="ln">5252 </span></a><span class="s0">`Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make</span>
<a name="l5253"><span class="ln">5253 </span></a><span class="s0">to your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately.</span>
<a name="l5254"><span class="ln">5254 </span></a><span class="s0">I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him</span>
<a name="l5255"><span class="ln">5255 </span></a><span class="s0">on the present occasion.  I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'--</span>
<a name="l5256"><span class="ln">5256 </span></a><span class="s0">If he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming</span>
<a name="l5257"><span class="ln">5257 </span></a><span class="s0">a man, there would be no opposition made to his going.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5258"><span class="ln">5258 </span></a>
<a name="l5259"><span class="ln">5259 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot; said Emma, laughing; &quot;but perhaps there might be some made to his</span>
<a name="l5260"><span class="ln">5260 </span></a><span class="s0">coming back again.  Such language for a young man entirely dependent,</span>
<a name="l5261"><span class="ln">5261 </span></a><span class="s0">to use!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible.</span>
<a name="l5262"><span class="ln">5262 </span></a><span class="s0">But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly</span>
<a name="l5263"><span class="ln">5263 </span></a><span class="s0">opposite to your own.  Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such</span>
<a name="l5264"><span class="ln">5264 </span></a><span class="s0">a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up,</span>
<a name="l5265"><span class="ln">5265 </span></a><span class="s0">and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room,</span>
<a name="l5266"><span class="ln">5266 </span></a><span class="s0">I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine</span>
<a name="l5267"><span class="ln">5267 </span></a><span class="s0">such conduct practicable?&quot;</span>
<a name="l5268"><span class="ln">5268 </span></a>
<a name="l5269"><span class="ln">5269 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.</span>
<a name="l5270"><span class="ln">5270 </span></a><span class="s0">He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made,</span>
<a name="l5271"><span class="ln">5271 </span></a><span class="s0">of course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--</span>
<a name="l5272"><span class="ln">5272 </span></a><span class="s0">would do him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger</span>
<a name="l5273"><span class="ln">5273 </span></a><span class="s0">with the people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts</span>
<a name="l5274"><span class="ln">5274 </span></a><span class="s0">and expedients can ever do.  Respect would be added to affection.</span>
<a name="l5275"><span class="ln">5275 </span></a><span class="s0">They would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had</span>
<a name="l5276"><span class="ln">5276 </span></a><span class="s0">done rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know,</span>
<a name="l5277"><span class="ln">5277 </span></a><span class="s0">as well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he</span>
<a name="l5278"><span class="ln">5278 </span></a><span class="s0">ought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting</span>
<a name="l5279"><span class="ln">5279 </span></a><span class="s0">their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better</span>
<a name="l5280"><span class="ln">5280 </span></a><span class="s0">of him for submitting to their whims.  Respect for right conduct</span>
<a name="l5281"><span class="ln">5281 </span></a><span class="s0">is felt by every body.  If he would act in this sort of manner,</span>
<a name="l5282"><span class="ln">5282 </span></a><span class="s0">on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend</span>
<a name="l5283"><span class="ln">5283 </span></a><span class="s0">to his.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5284"><span class="ln">5284 </span></a>
<a name="l5285"><span class="ln">5285 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I rather doubt that.  You are very fond of bending little minds;</span>
<a name="l5286"><span class="ln">5286 </span></a><span class="s0">but where little minds belong to rich people in authority,</span>
<a name="l5287"><span class="ln">5287 </span></a><span class="s0">I think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as</span>
<a name="l5288"><span class="ln">5288 </span></a><span class="s0">unmanageable as great ones.  I can imagine, that if you, as you are,</span>
<a name="l5289"><span class="ln">5289 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in</span>
<a name="l5290"><span class="ln">5290 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Frank Churchill's situation, you would be able to say and do</span>
<a name="l5291"><span class="ln">5291 </span></a><span class="s0">just what you have been recommending for him; and it might have</span>
<a name="l5292"><span class="ln">5292 </span></a><span class="s0">a very good effect.  The Churchills might not have a word to say</span>
<a name="l5293"><span class="ln">5293 </span></a><span class="s0">in return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience</span>
<a name="l5294"><span class="ln">5294 </span></a><span class="s0">and long observance to break through.  To him who has, it might</span>
<a name="l5295"><span class="ln">5295 </span></a><span class="s0">not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence,</span>
<a name="l5296"><span class="ln">5296 </span></a><span class="s0">and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought.</span>
<a name="l5297"><span class="ln">5297 </span></a><span class="s0">He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have,</span>
<a name="l5298"><span class="ln">5298 </span></a><span class="s0">without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up</span>
<a name="l5299"><span class="ln">5299 </span></a><span class="s0">to it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5300"><span class="ln">5300 </span></a>
<a name="l5301"><span class="ln">5301 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Then it would not be so strong a sense.  If it failed to produce</span>
<a name="l5302"><span class="ln">5302 </span></a><span class="s0">equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5303"><span class="ln">5303 </span></a>
<a name="l5304"><span class="ln">5304 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh, the difference of situation and habit!  I wish you would try</span>
<a name="l5305"><span class="ln">5305 </span></a><span class="s0">to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel</span>
<a name="l5306"><span class="ln">5306 </span></a><span class="s0">in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been</span>
<a name="l5307"><span class="ln">5307 </span></a><span class="s0">looking up to all his life.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5308"><span class="ln">5308 </span></a>
<a name="l5309"><span class="ln">5309 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first</span>
<a name="l5310"><span class="ln">5310 </span></a><span class="s0">occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against</span>
<a name="l5311"><span class="ln">5311 </span></a><span class="s0">the will of others.  It ought to have been a habit with him by</span>
<a name="l5312"><span class="ln">5312 </span></a><span class="s0">this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency.</span>
<a name="l5313"><span class="ln">5313 </span></a><span class="s0">I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man.</span>
<a name="l5314"><span class="ln">5314 </span></a><span class="s0">As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off</span>
<a name="l5315"><span class="ln">5315 </span></a><span class="s0">all that was unworthy in their authority.  He ought to have opposed</span>
<a name="l5316"><span class="ln">5316 </span></a><span class="s0">the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father.</span>
<a name="l5317"><span class="ln">5317 </span></a><span class="s0">Had he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5318"><span class="ln">5318 </span></a>
<a name="l5319"><span class="ln">5319 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We shall never agree about him,&quot; cried Emma; &quot;but that is</span>
<a name="l5320"><span class="ln">5320 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing extraordinary.  I have not the least idea of his being</span>
<a name="l5321"><span class="ln">5321 </span></a><span class="s0">a weak young man:  I feel sure that he is not.  Mr. Weston would</span>
<a name="l5322"><span class="ln">5322 </span></a><span class="s0">not be blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely</span>
<a name="l5323"><span class="ln">5323 </span></a><span class="s0">to have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit</span>
<a name="l5324"><span class="ln">5324 </span></a><span class="s0">your notions of man's perfection.  I dare say he has; and though</span>
<a name="l5325"><span class="ln">5325 </span></a><span class="s0">it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5326"><span class="ln">5326 </span></a>
<a name="l5327"><span class="ln">5327 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move,</span>
<a name="l5328"><span class="ln">5328 </span></a><span class="s0">and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself</span>
<a name="l5329"><span class="ln">5329 </span></a><span class="s0">extremely expert in finding excuses for it.  He can sit down and</span>
<a name="l5330"><span class="ln">5330 </span></a><span class="s0">write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods,</span>
<a name="l5331"><span class="ln">5331 </span></a><span class="s0">and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method</span>
<a name="l5332"><span class="ln">5332 </span></a><span class="s0">in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father's</span>
<a name="l5333"><span class="ln">5333 </span></a><span class="s0">having any right to complain.  His letters disgust me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5334"><span class="ln">5334 </span></a>
<a name="l5335"><span class="ln">5335 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Your feelings are singular.  They seem to satisfy every body else.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5336"><span class="ln">5336 </span></a>
<a name="l5337"><span class="ln">5337 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston.  They hardly can</span>
<a name="l5338"><span class="ln">5338 </span></a><span class="s0">satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings:  standing in</span>
<a name="l5339"><span class="ln">5339 </span></a><span class="s0">a mother's place, but without a mother's affection to blind her.</span>
<a name="l5340"><span class="ln">5340 </span></a><span class="s0">It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due,</span>
<a name="l5341"><span class="ln">5341 </span></a><span class="s0">and she must doubly feel the omission.  Had she been a person</span>
<a name="l5342"><span class="ln">5342 </span></a><span class="s0">of consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would</span>
<a name="l5343"><span class="ln">5343 </span></a><span class="s0">not have signified whether he did or no.  Can you think your friend</span>
<a name="l5344"><span class="ln">5344 </span></a><span class="s0">behindhand in these sort of considerations?  Do you suppose she</span>
<a name="l5345"><span class="ln">5345 </span></a><span class="s0">does not often say all this to herself?  No, Emma, your amiable</span>
<a name="l5346"><span class="ln">5346 </span></a><span class="s0">young man can be amiable only in French, not in English.  He may be</span>
<a name="l5347"><span class="ln">5347 </span></a><span class="s0">very `aimable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he</span>
<a name="l5348"><span class="ln">5348 </span></a><span class="s0">can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people:</span>
<a name="l5349"><span class="ln">5349 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing really amiable about him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5350"><span class="ln">5350 </span></a>
<a name="l5351"><span class="ln">5351 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You seem determined to think ill of him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5352"><span class="ln">5352 </span></a>
<a name="l5353"><span class="ln">5353 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Me!--not at all,&quot; replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; &quot;I do</span>
<a name="l5354"><span class="ln">5354 </span></a><span class="s0">not want to think ill of him.  I should be as ready to acknowledge</span>
<a name="l5355"><span class="ln">5355 </span></a><span class="s0">his merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are</span>
<a name="l5356"><span class="ln">5356 </span></a><span class="s0">merely personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,</span>
<a name="l5357"><span class="ln">5357 </span></a><span class="s0">plausible manners.&quot;</span>

<a name="l5359"><span class="ln">5359 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a</span>
<a name="l5360"><span class="ln">5360 </span></a><span class="s0">treasure at Highbury.  We do not often look upon fine young men,</span>
<a name="l5361"><span class="ln">5361 </span></a><span class="s0">well-bred and agreeable.  We must not be nice and ask for all</span>
<a name="l5362"><span class="ln">5362 </span></a><span class="s0">the virtues into the bargain.  Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l5363"><span class="ln">5363 </span></a><span class="s0">what a _sensation_ his coming will produce?  There will be but one subject</span>
<a name="l5364"><span class="ln">5364 </span></a><span class="s0">throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--</span>
<a name="l5365"><span class="ln">5365 </span></a><span class="s0">one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill;</span>
<a name="l5366"><span class="ln">5366 </span></a><span class="s0">we shall think and speak of nobody else.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5367"><span class="ln">5367 </span></a>
<a name="l5368"><span class="ln">5368 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him</span>
<a name="l5369"><span class="ln">5369 </span></a><span class="s0">conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only</span>
<a name="l5370"><span class="ln">5370 </span></a><span class="s0">a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5371"><span class="ln">5371 </span></a>
<a name="l5372"><span class="ln">5372 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste</span>
<a name="l5373"><span class="ln">5373 </span></a><span class="s0">of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being</span>
<a name="l5374"><span class="ln">5374 </span></a><span class="s0">universally agreeable.  To you, he will talk of farming; to me,</span>
<a name="l5375"><span class="ln">5375 </span></a><span class="s0">of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general</span>
<a name="l5376"><span class="ln">5376 </span></a><span class="s0">information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead,</span>
<a name="l5377"><span class="ln">5377 </span></a><span class="s0">or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak</span>
<a name="l5378"><span class="ln">5378 </span></a><span class="s0">extremely well on each; that is my idea of him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5379"><span class="ln">5379 </span></a>
<a name="l5380"><span class="ln">5380 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And mine,&quot; said Mr. Knightley warmly, &quot;is, that if he turn out any</span>
<a name="l5381"><span class="ln">5381 </span></a><span class="s0">thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing!</span>
<a name="l5382"><span class="ln">5382 </span></a><span class="s0">What! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--</span>
<a name="l5383"><span class="ln">5383 </span></a><span class="s0">the practised politician, who is to read every body's character,</span>
<a name="l5384"><span class="ln">5384 </span></a><span class="s0">and make every body's talents conduce to the display of his</span>
<a name="l5385"><span class="ln">5385 </span></a><span class="s0">own superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around, that he</span>
<a name="l5386"><span class="ln">5386 </span></a><span class="s0">may make all appear like fools compared with himself!  My dear Emma,</span>
<a name="l5387"><span class="ln">5387 </span></a><span class="s0">your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came</span>
<a name="l5388"><span class="ln">5388 </span></a><span class="s0">to the point.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5389"><span class="ln">5389 </span></a>
<a name="l5390"><span class="ln">5390 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I will say no more about him,&quot; cried Emma, &quot;you turn every</span>
<a name="l5391"><span class="ln">5391 </span></a><span class="s0">thing to evil.  We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him;</span>
<a name="l5392"><span class="ln">5392 </span></a><span class="s0">and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5393"><span class="ln">5393 </span></a>
<a name="l5394"><span class="ln">5394 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Prejudiced!  I am not prejudiced.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5395"><span class="ln">5395 </span></a>
<a name="l5396"><span class="ln">5396 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it.</span>
<a name="l5397"><span class="ln">5397 </span></a><span class="s0">My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in</span>
<a name="l5398"><span class="ln">5398 </span></a><span class="s0">his favour.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5399"><span class="ln">5399 </span></a>
<a name="l5400"><span class="ln">5400 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,&quot;</span>
<a name="l5401"><span class="ln">5401 </span></a><span class="s0">said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma</span>
<a name="l5402"><span class="ln">5402 </span></a><span class="s0">immediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend</span>
<a name="l5403"><span class="ln">5403 </span></a><span class="s0">why he should be angry.</span>
<a name="l5404"><span class="ln">5404 </span></a>
<a name="l5405"><span class="ln">5405 </span></a><span class="s0">To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be</span>
<a name="l5406"><span class="ln">5406 </span></a><span class="s0">of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real</span>
<a name="l5407"><span class="ln">5407 </span></a><span class="s0">liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him;</span>
<a name="l5408"><span class="ln">5408 </span></a><span class="s0">for with all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid</span>
<a name="l5409"><span class="ln">5409 </span></a><span class="s0">to his charge, she had never before for a moment supposed it could</span>
<a name="l5410"><span class="ln">5410 </span></a><span class="s0">make him unjust to the merit of another.</span>

<a name="l5419"><span class="ln">5419 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER I</span>
<a name="l5420"><span class="ln">5420 </span></a>
<a name="l5421"><span class="ln">5421 </span></a>
<a name="l5422"><span class="ln">5422 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and,</span>
<a name="l5423"><span class="ln">5423 </span></a><span class="s0">in Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day.</span>
<a name="l5424"><span class="ln">5424 </span></a><span class="s0">She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more;</span>
<a name="l5425"><span class="ln">5425 </span></a><span class="s0">and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject</span>
<a name="l5426"><span class="ln">5426 </span></a><span class="s0">as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she</span>
<a name="l5427"><span class="ln">5427 </span></a><span class="s0">had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must</span>
<a name="l5428"><span class="ln">5428 </span></a><span class="s0">suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive--</span>
<a name="l5429"><span class="ln">5429 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!&quot; she found something else must be done.</span>
<a name="l5430"><span class="ln">5430 </span></a>
<a name="l5431"><span class="ln">5431 </span></a><span class="s0">They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.</span>
<a name="l5432"><span class="ln">5432 </span></a><span class="s0">She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.</span>
<a name="l5433"><span class="ln">5433 </span></a><span class="s0">There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and</span>
<a name="l5434"><span class="ln">5434 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered</span>
<a name="l5435"><span class="ln">5435 </span></a><span class="s0">by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her,</span>
<a name="l5436"><span class="ln">5436 </span></a><span class="s0">as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she</span>
<a name="l5437"><span class="ln">5437 </span></a><span class="s0">ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.</span>
<a name="l5438"><span class="ln">5438 </span></a>
<a name="l5439"><span class="ln">5439 </span></a><span class="s0">She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,</span>
<a name="l5440"><span class="ln">5440 </span></a><span class="s0">as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion</span>
<a name="l5441"><span class="ln">5441 </span></a><span class="s0">of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--</span>
<a name="l5442"><span class="ln">5442 </span></a><span class="s0">and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate</span>
<a name="l5443"><span class="ln">5443 </span></a><span class="s0">and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever,</span>
<a name="l5444"><span class="ln">5444 </span></a><span class="s0">and therefore she seldom went near them.  But now she made the sudden</span>
<a name="l5445"><span class="ln">5445 </span></a><span class="s0">resolution of not passing their door without going in--observing,</span>
<a name="l5446"><span class="ln">5446 </span></a><span class="s0">as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate,</span>
<a name="l5447"><span class="ln">5447 </span></a><span class="s0">they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.</span>
<a name="l5448"><span class="ln">5448 </span></a>
<a name="l5449"><span class="ln">5449 </span></a><span class="s0">The house belonged to people in business.  Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied</span>
<a name="l5450"><span class="ln">5450 </span></a><span class="s0">the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,</span>
<a name="l5451"><span class="ln">5451 </span></a><span class="s0">which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially</span>
<a name="l5452"><span class="ln">5452 </span></a><span class="s0">and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her</span>
<a name="l5453"><span class="ln">5453 </span></a><span class="s0">knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up</span>
<a name="l5454"><span class="ln">5454 </span></a><span class="s0">her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter,</span>
<a name="l5455"><span class="ln">5455 </span></a><span class="s0">almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for</span>
<a name="l5456"><span class="ln">5456 </span></a><span class="s0">their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after</span>
<a name="l5457"><span class="ln">5457 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her mother's,</span>
<a name="l5458"><span class="ln">5458 </span></a><span class="s0">and sweet-cake from the beaufet--&quot;Mrs. Cole had just been there,</span>
<a name="l5459"><span class="ln">5459 </span></a><span class="s0">just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an</span>
<a name="l5460"><span class="ln">5460 </span></a><span class="s0">hour with them, and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind</span>
<a name="l5461"><span class="ln">5461 </span></a><span class="s0">as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss</span>
<a name="l5462"><span class="ln">5462 </span></a><span class="s0">Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5463"><span class="ln">5463 </span></a>
<a name="l5464"><span class="ln">5464 </span></a><span class="s0">The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.</span>
<a name="l5465"><span class="ln">5465 </span></a><span class="s0">There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from</span>
<a name="l5466"><span class="ln">5466 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton since his going away.  Emma knew what was coming; they must</span>
<a name="l5467"><span class="ln">5467 </span></a><span class="s0">have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone,</span>
<a name="l5468"><span class="ln">5468 </span></a><span class="s0">and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he</span>
<a name="l5469"><span class="ln">5469 </span></a><span class="s0">was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies'</span>
<a name="l5470"><span class="ln">5470 </span></a><span class="s0">ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the</span>
<a name="l5471"><span class="ln">5471 </span></a><span class="s0">interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always</span>
<a name="l5472"><span class="ln">5472 </span></a><span class="s0">putting forward to prevent Harriet's being obliged to say a word.</span>
<a name="l5473"><span class="ln">5473 </span></a>
<a name="l5474"><span class="ln">5474 </span></a><span class="s0">This she had been prepared for when she entered the house;</span>
<a name="l5475"><span class="ln">5475 </span></a><span class="s0">but meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther</span>
<a name="l5476"><span class="ln">5476 </span></a><span class="s0">incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst</span>
<a name="l5477"><span class="ln">5477 </span></a><span class="s0">all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties.</span>
<a name="l5478"><span class="ln">5478 </span></a><span class="s0">She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton;</span>
<a name="l5479"><span class="ln">5479 </span></a><span class="s0">but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away</span>
<a name="l5480"><span class="ln">5480 </span></a><span class="s0">from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from</span>
<a name="l5481"><span class="ln">5481 </span></a><span class="s0">her niece.</span>
<a name="l5482"><span class="ln">5482 </span></a>
<a name="l5483"><span class="ln">5483 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--</span>
<a name="l5484"><span class="ln">5484 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--</span>
<a name="l5485"><span class="ln">5485 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane;</span>
<a name="l5486"><span class="ln">5486 </span></a><span class="s0">for as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her,</span>
<a name="l5487"><span class="ln">5487 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane is so very great a favourite there.  Whenever she is with us,</span>
<a name="l5488"><span class="ln">5488 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough;</span>
<a name="l5489"><span class="ln">5489 </span></a><span class="s0">and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can.</span>
<a name="l5490"><span class="ln">5490 </span></a><span class="s0">And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, `I know you</span>
<a name="l5491"><span class="ln">5491 </span></a><span class="s0">cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time</span>
<a name="l5492"><span class="ln">5492 </span></a><span class="s0">for writing;' and when I immediately said, `But indeed we have,</span>
<a name="l5493"><span class="ln">5493 </span></a><span class="s0">we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw</span>
<a name="l5494"><span class="ln">5494 </span></a><span class="s0">any body more surprized.  `Have you, upon your honour?' said she;</span>
<a name="l5495"><span class="ln">5495 </span></a><span class="s0">`well, that is quite unexpected.  Do let me hear what she says.'&quot;</span>
<a name="l5496"><span class="ln">5496 </span></a>
<a name="l5497"><span class="ln">5497 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--</span>
<a name="l5498"><span class="ln">5498 </span></a>
<a name="l5499"><span class="ln">5499 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately?  I am extremely happy.</span>
<a name="l5500"><span class="ln">5500 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope she is well?&quot;</span>
<a name="l5501"><span class="ln">5501 </span></a>
<a name="l5502"><span class="ln">5502 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you.  You are so kind!&quot; replied the happily deceived aunt,</span>
<a name="l5503"><span class="ln">5503 </span></a><span class="s0">while eagerly hunting for the letter.--&quot;Oh! here it is.  I was sure</span>
<a name="l5504"><span class="ln">5504 </span></a><span class="s0">it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,</span>
<a name="l5505"><span class="ln">5505 </span></a><span class="s0">without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand</span>
<a name="l5506"><span class="ln">5506 </span></a><span class="s0">so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table.</span>
<a name="l5507"><span class="ln">5507 </span></a><span class="s0">I was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was</span>
<a name="l5508"><span class="ln">5508 </span></a><span class="s0">reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her--</span>
<a name="l5509"><span class="ln">5509 </span></a><span class="s0">a letter from Jane--that she can never hear it often enough;</span>
<a name="l5510"><span class="ln">5510 </span></a><span class="s0">so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under</span>
<a name="l5511"><span class="ln">5511 </span></a><span class="s0">my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what</span>
<a name="l5512"><span class="ln">5512 </span></a><span class="s0">she says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane,</span>
<a name="l5513"><span class="ln">5513 </span></a><span class="s0">apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you see--</span>
<a name="l5514"><span class="ln">5514 </span></a><span class="s0">hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half.</span>
<a name="l5515"><span class="ln">5515 </span></a><span class="s0">My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.</span>
<a name="l5516"><span class="ln">5516 </span></a><span class="s0">She often says, when the letter is first opened, `Well, Hetty,</span>
<a name="l5517"><span class="ln">5517 </span></a><span class="s0">now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--</span>
<a name="l5518"><span class="ln">5518 </span></a><span class="s0">don't you, ma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive</span>
<a name="l5519"><span class="ln">5519 </span></a><span class="s0">to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her--</span>
<a name="l5520"><span class="ln">5520 </span></a><span class="s0">every word of it--I am sure she would pore over it till she had</span>
<a name="l5521"><span class="ln">5521 </span></a><span class="s0">made out every word.  And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are not</span>
<a name="l5522"><span class="ln">5522 </span></a><span class="s0">so good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God!</span>
<a name="l5523"><span class="ln">5523 </span></a><span class="s0">with the help of spectacles.  It is such a blessing!  My mother's</span>
<a name="l5524"><span class="ln">5524 </span></a><span class="s0">are really very good indeed.  Jane often says, when she is here,</span>
<a name="l5525"><span class="ln">5525 </span></a><span class="s0">`I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see</span>
<a name="l5526"><span class="ln">5526 </span></a><span class="s0">as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish</span>
<a name="l5527"><span class="ln">5527 </span></a><span class="s0">my eyes may last me as well.'&quot;</span>
<a name="l5528"><span class="ln">5528 </span></a>
<a name="l5529"><span class="ln">5529 </span></a><span class="s0">All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;</span>
<a name="l5530"><span class="ln">5530 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss</span>
<a name="l5531"><span class="ln">5531 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax's handwriting.</span>
<a name="l5532"><span class="ln">5532 </span></a>
<a name="l5533"><span class="ln">5533 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are extremely kind,&quot; replied Miss Bates, highly gratified;</span>
<a name="l5534"><span class="ln">5534 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself.</span>
<a name="l5535"><span class="ln">5535 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure there is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure</span>
<a name="l5536"><span class="ln">5536 </span></a><span class="s0">as Miss Woodhouse's. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf</span>
<a name="l5537"><span class="ln">5537 </span></a><span class="s0">you know.  Ma'am,&quot; addressing her, &quot;do you hear what Miss Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l5538"><span class="ln">5538 </span></a><span class="s0">is so obliging to say about Jane's handwriting?&quot;</span>
<a name="l5539"><span class="ln">5539 </span></a>
<a name="l5540"><span class="ln">5540 </span></a><span class="s0">And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment</span>
<a name="l5541"><span class="ln">5541 </span></a><span class="s0">repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it.</span>
<a name="l5542"><span class="ln">5542 </span></a><span class="s0">She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming</span>
<a name="l5543"><span class="ln">5543 </span></a><span class="s0">very rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had</span>
<a name="l5544"><span class="ln">5544 </span></a><span class="s0">almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse,</span>
<a name="l5545"><span class="ln">5545 </span></a><span class="s0">when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.</span>
<a name="l5546"><span class="ln">5546 </span></a>
<a name="l5547"><span class="ln">5547 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all.</span>
<a name="l5548"><span class="ln">5548 </span></a><span class="s0">By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,</span>
<a name="l5549"><span class="ln">5549 </span></a><span class="s0">she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice.  But it is very</span>
<a name="l5550"><span class="ln">5550 </span></a><span class="s0">remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.</span>
<a name="l5551"><span class="ln">5551 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane speaks so distinct!  However, she will not find her grandmama</span>
<a name="l5552"><span class="ln">5552 </span></a><span class="s0">at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great</span>
<a name="l5553"><span class="ln">5553 </span></a><span class="s0">deal at my mother's time of life--and it really is full two years,</span>
<a name="l5554"><span class="ln">5554 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, since she was here.  We never were so long without seeing</span>
<a name="l5555"><span class="ln">5555 </span></a><span class="s0">her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know</span>
<a name="l5556"><span class="ln">5556 </span></a><span class="s0">how to make enough of her now.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5557"><span class="ln">5557 </span></a>
<a name="l5558"><span class="ln">5558 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?&quot;</span>
<a name="l5559"><span class="ln">5559 </span></a>
<a name="l5560"><span class="ln">5560 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes; next week.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5561"><span class="ln">5561 </span></a>
<a name="l5562"><span class="ln">5562 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5563"><span class="ln">5563 </span></a>
<a name="l5564"><span class="ln">5564 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you.  You are very kind.  Yes, next week.  Every body is</span>
<a name="l5565"><span class="ln">5565 </span></a><span class="s0">so surprized; and every body says the same obliging things.  I am</span>
<a name="l5566"><span class="ln">5566 </span></a><span class="s0">sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they</span>
<a name="l5567"><span class="ln">5567 </span></a><span class="s0">can be to see her.  Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which,</span>
<a name="l5568"><span class="ln">5568 </span></a><span class="s0">because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one</span>
<a name="l5569"><span class="ln">5569 </span></a><span class="s0">of those days.  So very good of them to send her the whole way!</span>
<a name="l5570"><span class="ln">5570 </span></a><span class="s0">But they always do, you know.  Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next.</span>
<a name="l5571"><span class="ln">5571 </span></a><span class="s0">That is what she writes about.  That is the reason of her writing out</span>
<a name="l5572"><span class="ln">5572 </span></a><span class="s0">of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have</span>
<a name="l5573"><span class="ln">5573 </span></a><span class="s0">heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5574"><span class="ln">5574 </span></a>
<a name="l5575"><span class="ln">5575 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, so I imagined.  I was afraid there could be little chance</span>
<a name="l5576"><span class="ln">5576 </span></a><span class="s0">of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5577"><span class="ln">5577 </span></a>
<a name="l5578"><span class="ln">5578 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So obliging of you!  No, we should not have heard, if it had not</span>
<a name="l5579"><span class="ln">5579 </span></a><span class="s0">been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here</span>
<a name="l5580"><span class="ln">5580 </span></a><span class="s0">so soon.  My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months</span>
<a name="l5581"><span class="ln">5581 </span></a><span class="s0">with us at least.  Three months, she says so, positively, as I</span>
<a name="l5582"><span class="ln">5582 </span></a><span class="s0">am going to have the pleasure of reading to you.  The case is,</span>
<a name="l5583"><span class="ln">5583 </span></a><span class="s0">you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland.  Mrs. Dixon has</span>
<a name="l5584"><span class="ln">5584 </span></a><span class="s0">persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly.</span>
<a name="l5585"><span class="ln">5585 </span></a><span class="s0">They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so</span>
<a name="l5586"><span class="ln">5586 </span></a><span class="s0">impatient to see them again--for till she married, last October,</span>
<a name="l5587"><span class="ln">5587 </span></a><span class="s0">she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make</span>
<a name="l5588"><span class="ln">5588 </span></a><span class="s0">it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,</span>
<a name="l5589"><span class="ln">5589 </span></a><span class="s0">but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter</span>
<a name="l5590"><span class="ln">5590 </span></a><span class="s0">to her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was,</span>
<a name="l5591"><span class="ln">5591 </span></a><span class="s0">but we shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's</span>
<a name="l5592"><span class="ln">5592 </span></a><span class="s0">name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,</span>
<a name="l5593"><span class="ln">5593 </span></a><span class="s0">and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back</span>
<a name="l5594"><span class="ln">5594 </span></a><span class="s0">to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.</span>
<a name="l5595"><span class="ln">5595 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--</span>
<a name="l5596"><span class="ln">5596 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else;</span>
<a name="l5597"><span class="ln">5597 </span></a><span class="s0">but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak</span>
<a name="l5598"><span class="ln">5598 </span></a><span class="s0">of his own place while he was paying his addresses--and as Jane used</span>
<a name="l5599"><span class="ln">5599 </span></a><span class="s0">to be very often walking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell</span>
<a name="l5600"><span class="ln">5600 </span></a><span class="s0">were very particular about their daughter's not walking out</span>
<a name="l5601"><span class="ln">5601 </span></a><span class="s0">often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them;</span>
<a name="l5602"><span class="ln">5602 </span></a><span class="s0">of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell</span>
<a name="l5603"><span class="ln">5603 </span></a><span class="s0">about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word</span>
<a name="l5604"><span class="ln">5604 </span></a><span class="s0">that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he</span>
<a name="l5605"><span class="ln">5605 </span></a><span class="s0">had taken himself.  He is a most amiable, charming young man,</span>
<a name="l5606"><span class="ln">5606 </span></a><span class="s0">I believe.  Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account</span>
<a name="l5607"><span class="ln">5607 </span></a><span class="s0">of things.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5608"><span class="ln">5608 </span></a>
<a name="l5609"><span class="ln">5609 </span></a><span class="s0">At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering</span>
<a name="l5610"><span class="ln">5610 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon,</span>
<a name="l5611"><span class="ln">5611 </span></a><span class="s0">and the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design</span>
<a name="l5612"><span class="ln">5612 </span></a><span class="s0">of farther discovery,</span>
<a name="l5613"><span class="ln">5613 </span></a>
<a name="l5614"><span class="ln">5614 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed</span>
<a name="l5615"><span class="ln">5615 </span></a><span class="s0">to come to you at such a time.  Considering the very particular</span>
<a name="l5616"><span class="ln">5616 </span></a><span class="s0">friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected</span>
<a name="l5617"><span class="ln">5617 </span></a><span class="s0">her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5618"><span class="ln">5618 </span></a>
<a name="l5619"><span class="ln">5619 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very true, very true, indeed.  The very thing that we have always</span>
<a name="l5620"><span class="ln">5620 </span></a><span class="s0">been rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her</span>
<a name="l5621"><span class="ln">5621 </span></a><span class="s0">at such a distance from us, for months together--not able to come</span>
<a name="l5622"><span class="ln">5622 </span></a><span class="s0">if any thing was to happen.  But you see, every thing turns out</span>
<a name="l5623"><span class="ln">5623 </span></a><span class="s0">for the best.  They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to</span>
<a name="l5624"><span class="ln">5624 </span></a><span class="s0">come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it;</span>
<a name="l5625"><span class="ln">5625 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation,</span>
<a name="l5626"><span class="ln">5626 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the</span>
<a name="l5627"><span class="ln">5627 </span></a><span class="s0">least backward in any attention.  He is a most charming young man.</span>
<a name="l5628"><span class="ln">5628 </span></a><span class="s0">Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were</span>
<a name="l5629"><span class="ln">5629 </span></a><span class="s0">out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling</span>
<a name="l5630"><span class="ln">5630 </span></a><span class="s0">round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed</span>
<a name="l5631"><span class="ln">5631 </span></a><span class="s0">into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not,</span>
<a name="l5632"><span class="ln">5632 </span></a><span class="s0">with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--</span>
<a name="l5633"><span class="ln">5633 </span></a><span class="s0">(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we</span>
<a name="l5634"><span class="ln">5634 </span></a><span class="s0">had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!&quot;</span>
<a name="l5635"><span class="ln">5635 </span></a>
<a name="l5636"><span class="ln">5636 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish</span>
<a name="l5637"><span class="ln">5637 </span></a><span class="s0">of seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you</span>
<a name="l5638"><span class="ln">5638 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mrs. Bates?&quot;</span>
<a name="l5639"><span class="ln">5639 </span></a>
<a name="l5640"><span class="ln">5640 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel</span>
<a name="l5641"><span class="ln">5641 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they</span>
<a name="l5642"><span class="ln">5642 </span></a><span class="s0">should recommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try</span>
<a name="l5643"><span class="ln">5643 </span></a><span class="s0">her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5644"><span class="ln">5644 </span></a>
<a name="l5645"><span class="ln">5645 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am concerned to hear of it.  I think they judge wisely.</span>
<a name="l5646"><span class="ln">5646 </span></a><span class="s0">But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed.  Mrs. Dixon,</span>
<a name="l5647"><span class="ln">5647 </span></a><span class="s0">I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not,</span>
<a name="l5648"><span class="ln">5648 </span></a><span class="s0">by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5649"><span class="ln">5649 </span></a>
<a name="l5650"><span class="ln">5650 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no.  You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.</span>
<a name="l5651"><span class="ln">5651 </span></a><span class="s0">There is no comparison between them.  Miss Campbell always was</span>
<a name="l5652"><span class="ln">5652 </span></a><span class="s0">absolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5653"><span class="ln">5653 </span></a>
<a name="l5654"><span class="ln">5654 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, that of course.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5655"><span class="ln">5655 </span></a>
<a name="l5656"><span class="ln">5656 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th</span>
<a name="l5657"><span class="ln">5657 </span></a><span class="s0">of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been</span>
<a name="l5658"><span class="ln">5658 </span></a><span class="s0">well since.  A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her?</span>
<a name="l5659"><span class="ln">5659 </span></a><span class="s0">She never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us.</span>
<a name="l5660"><span class="ln">5660 </span></a><span class="s0">Just like her! so considerate!--But however, she is so far from well,</span>
<a name="l5661"><span class="ln">5661 </span></a><span class="s0">that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home,</span>
<a name="l5662"><span class="ln">5662 </span></a><span class="s0">and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt</span>
<a name="l5663"><span class="ln">5663 </span></a><span class="s0">that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her--</span>
<a name="l5664"><span class="ln">5664 </span></a><span class="s0">and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here,</span>
<a name="l5665"><span class="ln">5665 </span></a><span class="s0">than go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we</span>
<a name="l5666"><span class="ln">5666 </span></a><span class="s0">should do.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5667"><span class="ln">5667 </span></a>
<a name="l5668"><span class="ln">5668 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5669"><span class="ln">5669 </span></a>
<a name="l5670"><span class="ln">5670 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the</span>
<a name="l5671"><span class="ln">5671 </span></a><span class="s0">Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--</span>
<a name="l5672"><span class="ln">5672 </span></a><span class="s0">as you will find from Jane's letter.  So sudden!--You may guess,</span>
<a name="l5673"><span class="ln">5673 </span></a><span class="s0">dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in!</span>
<a name="l5674"><span class="ln">5674 </span></a><span class="s0">If it was not for the drawback of her illness--but I am afraid</span>
<a name="l5675"><span class="ln">5675 </span></a><span class="s0">we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly.</span>
<a name="l5676"><span class="ln">5676 </span></a><span class="s0">I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that.</span>
<a name="l5677"><span class="ln">5677 </span></a><span class="s0">I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first,</span>
<a name="l5678"><span class="ln">5678 </span></a><span class="s0">before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there</span>
<a name="l5679"><span class="ln">5679 </span></a><span class="s0">being any thing in them to distress her.  Jane desired me to do it,</span>
<a name="l5680"><span class="ln">5680 </span></a><span class="s0">so I always do:  and so I began to-day with my usual caution;</span>
<a name="l5681"><span class="ln">5681 </span></a><span class="s0">but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I</span>
<a name="l5682"><span class="ln">5682 </span></a><span class="s0">burst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'--</span>
<a name="l5683"><span class="ln">5683 </span></a><span class="s0">which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly</span>
<a name="l5684"><span class="ln">5684 </span></a><span class="s0">alarmed at.  However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad</span>
<a name="l5685"><span class="ln">5685 </span></a><span class="s0">as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her,</span>
<a name="l5686"><span class="ln">5686 </span></a><span class="s0">that she does not think much about it.  But I cannot imagine</span>
<a name="l5687"><span class="ln">5687 </span></a><span class="s0">how I could be so off my guard.  If Jane does not get well soon,</span>
<a name="l5688"><span class="ln">5688 </span></a><span class="s0">we will call in Mr. Perry.  The expense shall not be thought of;</span>
<a name="l5689"><span class="ln">5689 </span></a><span class="s0">and though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say</span>
<a name="l5690"><span class="ln">5690 </span></a><span class="s0">he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not</span>
<a name="l5691"><span class="ln">5691 </span></a><span class="s0">suffer it to be so, you know.  He has a wife and family to maintain,</span>
<a name="l5692"><span class="ln">5692 </span></a><span class="s0">and is not to be giving away his time.  Well, now I have just given you</span>
<a name="l5693"><span class="ln">5693 </span></a><span class="s0">a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am</span>
<a name="l5694"><span class="ln">5694 </span></a><span class="s0">sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it</span>
<a name="l5695"><span class="ln">5695 </span></a><span class="s0">for her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5696"><span class="ln">5696 </span></a>
<a name="l5697"><span class="ln">5697 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am afraid we must be running away,&quot; said Emma, glancing at Harriet,</span>
<a name="l5698"><span class="ln">5698 </span></a><span class="s0">and beginning to rise--&quot;My father will be expecting us.</span>
<a name="l5699"><span class="ln">5699 </span></a><span class="s0">I had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than</span>
<a name="l5700"><span class="ln">5700 </span></a><span class="s0">five minutes, when I first entered the house.  I merely called,</span>
<a name="l5701"><span class="ln">5701 </span></a><span class="s0">because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates;</span>
<a name="l5702"><span class="ln">5702 </span></a><span class="s0">but I have been so pleasantly detained!  Now, however, we must wish</span>
<a name="l5703"><span class="ln">5703 </span></a><span class="s0">you and Mrs. Bates good morning.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5704"><span class="ln">5704 </span></a>
<a name="l5705"><span class="ln">5705 </span></a><span class="s0">And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded.</span>
<a name="l5706"><span class="ln">5706 </span></a><span class="s0">She regained the street--happy in this, that though much had been</span>
<a name="l5707"><span class="ln">5707 </span></a><span class="s0">forced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard</span>

<a name="l5714"><span class="ln">5714 </span></a>
<a name="l5715"><span class="ln">5715 </span></a>
<a name="l5716"><span class="ln">5716 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's</span>
<a name="l5717"><span class="ln">5717 </span></a><span class="s0">youngest daughter.</span>
<a name="l5718"><span class="ln">5718 </span></a>
<a name="l5719"><span class="ln">5719 </span></a><span class="s0">The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry,</span>
<a name="l5720"><span class="ln">5720 </span></a><span class="s0">and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure,</span>
<a name="l5721"><span class="ln">5721 </span></a><span class="s0">hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy</span>
<a name="l5722"><span class="ln">5722 </span></a><span class="s0">remembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking</span>
<a name="l5723"><span class="ln">5723 </span></a><span class="s0">under consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.</span>
<a name="l5724"><span class="ln">5724 </span></a>
<a name="l5725"><span class="ln">5725 </span></a><span class="s0">By birth she belonged to Highbury:  and when at three years old,</span>
<a name="l5726"><span class="ln">5726 </span></a><span class="s0">on losing her mother, she became the property, the charge,</span>
<a name="l5727"><span class="ln">5727 </span></a><span class="s0">the consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had</span>
<a name="l5728"><span class="ln">5728 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there;</span>
<a name="l5729"><span class="ln">5729 </span></a><span class="s0">of her being taught only what very limited means could command,</span>
<a name="l5730"><span class="ln">5730 </span></a><span class="s0">and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement,</span>
<a name="l5731"><span class="ln">5731 </span></a><span class="s0">to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person,</span>
<a name="l5732"><span class="ln">5732 </span></a><span class="s0">good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.</span>
<a name="l5733"><span class="ln">5733 </span></a>
<a name="l5734"><span class="ln">5734 </span></a><span class="s0">But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave</span>
<a name="l5735"><span class="ln">5735 </span></a><span class="s0">a change to her destiny.  This was Colonel Campbell, who had</span>
<a name="l5736"><span class="ln">5736 </span></a><span class="s0">very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most</span>
<a name="l5737"><span class="ln">5737 </span></a><span class="s0">deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for</span>
<a name="l5738"><span class="ln">5738 </span></a><span class="s0">such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved</span>
<a name="l5739"><span class="ln">5739 </span></a><span class="s0">his life.  These were claims which he did not learn to overlook,</span>
<a name="l5740"><span class="ln">5740 </span></a><span class="s0">though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax,</span>
<a name="l5741"><span class="ln">5741 </span></a><span class="s0">before his own return to England put any thing in his power.</span>
<a name="l5742"><span class="ln">5742 </span></a><span class="s0">When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her.</span>
<a name="l5743"><span class="ln">5743 </span></a><span class="s0">He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl,</span>
<a name="l5744"><span class="ln">5744 </span></a><span class="s0">about Jane's age:  and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits</span>
<a name="l5745"><span class="ln">5745 </span></a><span class="s0">and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old,</span>
<a name="l5746"><span class="ln">5746 </span></a><span class="s0">his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being</span>
<a name="l5747"><span class="ln">5747 </span></a><span class="s0">a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell</span>
<a name="l5748"><span class="ln">5748 </span></a><span class="s0">of undertaking the whole charge of her education.  It was accepted;</span>
<a name="l5749"><span class="ln">5749 </span></a><span class="s0">and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family,</span>
<a name="l5750"><span class="ln">5750 </span></a><span class="s0">and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother</span>
<a name="l5751"><span class="ln">5751 </span></a><span class="s0">from time to time.</span>
<a name="l5752"><span class="ln">5752 </span></a>
<a name="l5753"><span class="ln">5753 </span></a><span class="s0">The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others;</span>
<a name="l5754"><span class="ln">5754 </span></a><span class="s0">the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father</span>
<a name="l5755"><span class="ln">5755 </span></a><span class="s0">making independence impossible.  To provide for her otherwise</span>
<a name="l5756"><span class="ln">5756 </span></a><span class="s0">was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay</span>
<a name="l5757"><span class="ln">5757 </span></a><span class="s0">and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must</span>
<a name="l5758"><span class="ln">5758 </span></a><span class="s0">be all his daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped</span>
<a name="l5759"><span class="ln">5759 </span></a><span class="s0">to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.</span>
<a name="l5760"><span class="ln">5760 </span></a>
<a name="l5761"><span class="ln">5761 </span></a><span class="s0">Such was Jane Fairfax's history.  She had fallen into good hands,</span>
<a name="l5762"><span class="ln">5762 </span></a><span class="s0">known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given</span>
<a name="l5763"><span class="ln">5763 </span></a><span class="s0">an excellent education.  Living constantly with right-minded</span>
<a name="l5764"><span class="ln">5764 </span></a><span class="s0">and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received</span>
<a name="l5765"><span class="ln">5765 </span></a><span class="s0">every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's</span>
<a name="l5766"><span class="ln">5766 </span></a><span class="s0">residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done</span>
<a name="l5767"><span class="ln">5767 </span></a><span class="s0">full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters.</span>
<a name="l5768"><span class="ln">5768 </span></a><span class="s0">Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that</span>
<a name="l5769"><span class="ln">5769 </span></a><span class="s0">friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far</span>
<a name="l5770"><span class="ln">5770 </span></a><span class="s0">as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,</span>
<a name="l5771"><span class="ln">5771 </span></a><span class="s0">fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she</span>
<a name="l5772"><span class="ln">5772 </span></a><span class="s0">was too much beloved to be parted with.  Neither father nor mother</span>
<a name="l5773"><span class="ln">5773 </span></a><span class="s0">could promote, and the daughter could not endure it.  The evil day</span>
<a name="l5774"><span class="ln">5774 </span></a><span class="s0">was put off.  It was easy to decide that she was still too young;</span>
<a name="l5775"><span class="ln">5775 </span></a><span class="s0">and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all</span>
<a name="l5776"><span class="ln">5776 </span></a><span class="s0">the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious</span>
<a name="l5777"><span class="ln">5777 </span></a><span class="s0">mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future,</span>
<a name="l5778"><span class="ln">5778 </span></a><span class="s0">the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind</span>
<a name="l5779"><span class="ln">5779 </span></a><span class="s0">her that all this might soon be over.</span>
<a name="l5780"><span class="ln">5780 </span></a>
<a name="l5781"><span class="ln">5781 </span></a><span class="s0">The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss</span>
<a name="l5782"><span class="ln">5782 </span></a><span class="s0">Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party</span>
<a name="l5783"><span class="ln">5783 </span></a><span class="s0">from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty</span>
<a name="l5784"><span class="ln">5784 </span></a><span class="s0">and acquirements.  That nature had given it in feature could not</span>
<a name="l5785"><span class="ln">5785 </span></a><span class="s0">be unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind</span>
<a name="l5786"><span class="ln">5786 </span></a><span class="s0">be unfelt by the parents.  They continued together with unabated</span>
<a name="l5787"><span class="ln">5787 </span></a><span class="s0">regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance,</span>
<a name="l5788"><span class="ln">5788 </span></a><span class="s0">that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs,</span>
<a name="l5789"><span class="ln">5789 </span></a><span class="s0">giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior,</span>
<a name="l5790"><span class="ln">5790 </span></a><span class="s0">engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable,</span>
<a name="l5791"><span class="ln">5791 </span></a><span class="s0">almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly</span>
<a name="l5792"><span class="ln">5792 </span></a><span class="s0">and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.</span>
<a name="l5793"><span class="ln">5793 </span></a>
<a name="l5794"><span class="ln">5794 </span></a><span class="s0">This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be</span>
<a name="l5795"><span class="ln">5795 </span></a><span class="s0">yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path</span>
<a name="l5796"><span class="ln">5796 </span></a><span class="s0">of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment</span>
<a name="l5797"><span class="ln">5797 </span></a><span class="s0">had fixed on for beginning.  She had long resolved that one-and-twenty</span>
<a name="l5798"><span class="ln">5798 </span></a><span class="s0">should be the period.  With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate,</span>
<a name="l5799"><span class="ln">5799 </span></a><span class="s0">she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice,</span>
<a name="l5800"><span class="ln">5800 </span></a><span class="s0">and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse,</span>
<a name="l5801"><span class="ln">5801 </span></a><span class="s0">equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.</span>
<a name="l5802"><span class="ln">5802 </span></a>
<a name="l5803"><span class="ln">5803 </span></a><span class="s0">The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such</span>
<a name="l5804"><span class="ln">5804 </span></a><span class="s0">a resolution, though their feelings did.  As long as they lived,</span>
<a name="l5805"><span class="ln">5805 </span></a><span class="s0">no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever;</span>
<a name="l5806"><span class="ln">5806 </span></a><span class="s0">and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly;</span>
<a name="l5807"><span class="ln">5807 </span></a><span class="s0">but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better</span>
<a name="l5808"><span class="ln">5808 </span></a><span class="s0">be soon.  Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder</span>
<a name="l5809"><span class="ln">5809 </span></a><span class="s0">and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared</span>
<a name="l5810"><span class="ln">5810 </span></a><span class="s0">her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must</span>
<a name="l5811"><span class="ln">5811 </span></a><span class="s0">now be relinquished.  Still, however, affection was glad to catch</span>
<a name="l5812"><span class="ln">5812 </span></a><span class="s0">at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.</span>
<a name="l5813"><span class="ln">5813 </span></a><span class="s0">She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage;</span>
<a name="l5814"><span class="ln">5814 </span></a><span class="s0">and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength,</span>
<a name="l5815"><span class="ln">5815 </span></a><span class="s0">they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being</span>
<a name="l5816"><span class="ln">5816 </span></a><span class="s0">compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed,</span>
<a name="l5817"><span class="ln">5817 </span></a><span class="s0">under the most favourable circumstances, to require something</span>
<a name="l5818"><span class="ln">5818 </span></a><span class="s0">more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with</span>
<a name="l5819"><span class="ln">5819 </span></a><span class="s0">tolerable comfort.</span>
<a name="l5820"><span class="ln">5820 </span></a>
<a name="l5821"><span class="ln">5821 </span></a><span class="s0">With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account</span>
<a name="l5822"><span class="ln">5822 </span></a><span class="s0">to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some</span>
<a name="l5823"><span class="ln">5823 </span></a><span class="s0">truths not told.  It was her own choice to give the time of their</span>
<a name="l5824"><span class="ln">5824 </span></a><span class="s0">absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect</span>
<a name="l5825"><span class="ln">5825 </span></a><span class="s0">liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear:</span>
<a name="l5826"><span class="ln">5826 </span></a><span class="s0">and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives,</span>
<a name="l5827"><span class="ln">5827 </span></a><span class="s0">whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement</span>
<a name="l5828"><span class="ln">5828 </span></a><span class="s0">their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few</span>
<a name="l5829"><span class="ln">5829 </span></a><span class="s0">months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health,</span>
<a name="l5830"><span class="ln">5830 </span></a><span class="s0">than on any thing else.  Certain it was that she was to come;</span>
<a name="l5831"><span class="ln">5831 </span></a><span class="s0">and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which</span>
<a name="l5832"><span class="ln">5832 </span></a><span class="s0">had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for</span>
<a name="l5833"><span class="ln">5833 </span></a><span class="s0">the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness</span>
<a name="l5834"><span class="ln">5834 </span></a><span class="s0">of a two years' absence.</span>
<a name="l5835"><span class="ln">5835 </span></a>
<a name="l5836"><span class="ln">5836 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did</span>
<a name="l5837"><span class="ln">5837 </span></a><span class="s0">not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than</span>
<a name="l5838"><span class="ln">5838 </span></a><span class="s0">she wished, and less than she ought!  Why she did not like Jane</span>
<a name="l5839"><span class="ln">5839 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l5840"><span class="ln">5840 </span></a><span class="s0">had once told her it was because she saw in her the really</span>
<a name="l5841"><span class="ln">5841 </span></a><span class="s0">accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself;</span>
<a name="l5842"><span class="ln">5842 </span></a><span class="s0">and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time,</span>
<a name="l5843"><span class="ln">5843 </span></a><span class="s0">there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could</span>
<a name="l5844"><span class="ln">5844 </span></a><span class="s0">not quite acquit her.  But &quot;she could never get acquainted with her:</span>
<a name="l5845"><span class="ln">5845 </span></a><span class="s0">she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--</span>
<a name="l5846"><span class="ln">5846 </span></a><span class="s0">such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not--and then,</span>
<a name="l5847"><span class="ln">5847 </span></a><span class="s0">her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss</span>
<a name="l5848"><span class="ln">5848 </span></a><span class="s0">with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were</span>
<a name="l5849"><span class="ln">5849 </span></a><span class="s0">to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every body had</span>
<a name="l5850"><span class="ln">5850 </span></a><span class="s0">supposed they must be so fond of each other.&quot;  These were her reasons--</span>
<a name="l5851"><span class="ln">5851 </span></a><span class="s0">she had no better.</span>
<a name="l5852"><span class="ln">5852 </span></a>
<a name="l5853"><span class="ln">5853 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified</span>
<a name="l5854"><span class="ln">5854 </span></a><span class="s0">by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any</span>
<a name="l5855"><span class="ln">5855 </span></a><span class="s0">considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her;</span>
<a name="l5856"><span class="ln">5856 </span></a><span class="s0">and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'</span>
<a name="l5857"><span class="ln">5857 </span></a><span class="s0">interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance</span>
<a name="l5858"><span class="ln">5858 </span></a><span class="s0">and manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.</span>
<a name="l5859"><span class="ln">5859 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had</span>
<a name="l5860"><span class="ln">5860 </span></a><span class="s0">herself the highest value for elegance.  Her height was pretty,</span>
<a name="l5861"><span class="ln">5861 </span></a><span class="s0">just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could</span>
<a name="l5862"><span class="ln">5862 </span></a><span class="s0">think very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most</span>
<a name="l5863"><span class="ln">5863 </span></a><span class="s0">becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance</span>
<a name="l5864"><span class="ln">5864 </span></a><span class="s0">of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two.</span>
<a name="l5865"><span class="ln">5865 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her face--her features--</span>
<a name="l5866"><span class="ln">5866 </span></a><span class="s0">there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered;</span>
<a name="l5867"><span class="ln">5867 </span></a><span class="s0">it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.  Her eyes,</span>
<a name="l5868"><span class="ln">5868 </span></a><span class="s0">a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied</span>
<a name="l5869"><span class="ln">5869 </span></a><span class="s0">their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at,</span>
<a name="l5870"><span class="ln">5870 </span></a><span class="s0">as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed</span>
<a name="l5871"><span class="ln">5871 </span></a><span class="s0">no fuller bloom.  It was a style of beauty, of which elegance</span>
<a name="l5872"><span class="ln">5872 </span></a><span class="s0">was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour,</span>
<a name="l5873"><span class="ln">5873 </span></a><span class="s0">by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person</span>
<a name="l5874"><span class="ln">5874 </span></a><span class="s0">or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.  There, not to be vulgar,</span>
<a name="l5875"><span class="ln">5875 </span></a><span class="s0">was distinction, and merit.</span>
<a name="l5876"><span class="ln">5876 </span></a>
<a name="l5877"><span class="ln">5877 </span></a><span class="s0">In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax</span>
<a name="l5878"><span class="ln">5878 </span></a><span class="s0">with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense</span>
<a name="l5879"><span class="ln">5879 </span></a><span class="s0">of rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike</span>
<a name="l5880"><span class="ln">5880 </span></a><span class="s0">her no longer.  When she took in her history, indeed, her situation,</span>
<a name="l5881"><span class="ln">5881 </span></a><span class="s0">as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance</span>
<a name="l5882"><span class="ln">5882 </span></a><span class="s0">was destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going</span>
<a name="l5883"><span class="ln">5883 </span></a><span class="s0">to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion</span>
<a name="l5884"><span class="ln">5884 </span></a><span class="s0">and respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling</span>
<a name="l5885"><span class="ln">5885 </span></a><span class="s0">her to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance</span>
<a name="l5886"><span class="ln">5886 </span></a><span class="s0">of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so naturally started</span>
<a name="l5887"><span class="ln">5887 </span></a><span class="s0">to herself.  In that case, nothing could be more pitiable</span>
<a name="l5888"><span class="ln">5888 </span></a><span class="s0">or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.</span>
<a name="l5889"><span class="ln">5889 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced</span>
<a name="l5890"><span class="ln">5890 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous</span>
<a name="l5891"><span class="ln">5891 </span></a><span class="s0">which her imagination had suggested at first.  If it were love,</span>
<a name="l5892"><span class="ln">5892 </span></a><span class="s0">it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.</span>
<a name="l5893"><span class="ln">5893 </span></a><span class="s0">She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,</span>
<a name="l5894"><span class="ln">5894 </span></a><span class="s0">while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best,</span>
<a name="l5895"><span class="ln">5895 </span></a><span class="s0">the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit</span>
<a name="l5896"><span class="ln">5896 </span></a><span class="s0">to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from</span>
<a name="l5897"><span class="ln">5897 </span></a><span class="s0">him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.</span>
<a name="l5898"><span class="ln">5898 </span></a>
<a name="l5899"><span class="ln">5899 </span></a><span class="s0">Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,</span>
<a name="l5900"><span class="ln">5900 </span></a><span class="s0">as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury</span>
<a name="l5901"><span class="ln">5901 </span></a><span class="s0">afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;</span>
<a name="l5902"><span class="ln">5902 </span></a><span class="s0">nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.</span>
<a name="l5903"><span class="ln">5903 </span></a>
<a name="l5904"><span class="ln">5904 </span></a><span class="s0">These were charming feelings--but not lasting.  Before she had</span>
<a name="l5905"><span class="ln">5905 </span></a><span class="s0">committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for</span>
<a name="l5906"><span class="ln">5906 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices</span>
<a name="l5907"><span class="ln">5907 </span></a><span class="s0">and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, &quot;She certainly is handsome;</span>
<a name="l5908"><span class="ln">5908 </span></a><span class="s0">she is better than handsome!&quot;  Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield</span>
<a name="l5909"><span class="ln">5909 </span></a><span class="s0">with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much</span>
<a name="l5910"><span class="ln">5910 </span></a><span class="s0">into its usual state.  Former provocations reappeared.  The aunt</span>
<a name="l5911"><span class="ln">5911 </span></a><span class="s0">was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her</span>
<a name="l5912"><span class="ln">5912 </span></a><span class="s0">health was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to</span>
<a name="l5913"><span class="ln">5913 </span></a><span class="s0">listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter</span>
<a name="l5914"><span class="ln">5914 </span></a><span class="s0">she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner,</span>
<a name="l5915"><span class="ln">5915 </span></a><span class="s0">as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her</span>
<a name="l5916"><span class="ln">5916 </span></a><span class="s0">mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.  They had music;</span>
<a name="l5917"><span class="ln">5917 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily</span>
<a name="l5918"><span class="ln">5918 </span></a><span class="s0">followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air</span>
<a name="l5919"><span class="ln">5919 </span></a><span class="s0">of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very</span>
<a name="l5920"><span class="ln">5920 </span></a><span class="s0">superior performance.  She was, besides, which was the worst of all,</span>
<a name="l5921"><span class="ln">5921 </span></a><span class="s0">so cold, so cautious!  There was no getting at her real opinion.</span>
<a name="l5922"><span class="ln">5922 </span></a><span class="s0">Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined</span>
<a name="l5923"><span class="ln">5923 </span></a><span class="s0">to hazard nothing.  She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.</span>
<a name="l5924"><span class="ln">5924 </span></a>
<a name="l5925"><span class="ln">5925 </span></a><span class="s0">If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more</span>
<a name="l5926"><span class="ln">5926 </span></a><span class="s0">reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.</span>
<a name="l5927"><span class="ln">5927 </span></a><span class="s0">She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character,</span>
<a name="l5928"><span class="ln">5928 </span></a><span class="s0">or her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness</span>
<a name="l5929"><span class="ln">5929 </span></a><span class="s0">of the match.  It was all general approbation and smoothness;</span>
<a name="l5930"><span class="ln">5930 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing delineated or distinguished.  It did her no service however.</span>
<a name="l5931"><span class="ln">5931 </span></a><span class="s0">Her caution was thrown away.  Emma saw its artifice, and returned</span>
<a name="l5932"><span class="ln">5932 </span></a><span class="s0">to her first surmises.  There probably _was_ something more to conceal</span>
<a name="l5933"><span class="ln">5933 </span></a><span class="s0">than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near</span>
<a name="l5934"><span class="ln">5934 </span></a><span class="s0">changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell,</span>
<a name="l5935"><span class="ln">5935 </span></a><span class="s0">for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.</span>
<a name="l5936"><span class="ln">5936 </span></a>
<a name="l5937"><span class="ln">5937 </span></a><span class="s0">The like reserve prevailed on other topics.  She and Mr. Frank Churchill</span>
<a name="l5938"><span class="ln">5938 </span></a><span class="s0">had been at Weymouth at the same time.  It was known that they were</span>
<a name="l5939"><span class="ln">5939 </span></a><span class="s0">a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma</span>
<a name="l5940"><span class="ln">5940 </span></a><span class="s0">procure as to what he truly was.  &quot;Was he handsome?&quot;--&quot;She believed</span>
<a name="l5941"><span class="ln">5941 </span></a><span class="s0">he was reckoned a very fine young man.&quot;  &quot;Was he agreeable?&quot;--</span>
<a name="l5942"><span class="ln">5942 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He was generally thought so.&quot;  &quot;Did he appear a sensible young man;</span>
<a name="l5943"><span class="ln">5943 </span></a><span class="s0">a young man of information?&quot;--&quot;At a watering-place, or in a common</span>
<a name="l5944"><span class="ln">5944 </span></a><span class="s0">London acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.</span>
<a name="l5945"><span class="ln">5945 </span></a><span class="s0">Manners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer</span>
<a name="l5946"><span class="ln">5946 </span></a><span class="s0">knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill.  She believed</span>
<a name="l5947"><span class="ln">5947 </span></a><span class="s0">every body found his manners pleasing.&quot;  Emma could not forgive her.</span>
<a name="l5948"><span class="ln">5948 </span></a>
<a name="l5949"><span class="ln">5949 </span></a>
<a name="l5950"><span class="ln">5950 </span></a>
<a name="l5951"><span class="ln">5951 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>
<a name="l5952"><span class="ln">5952 </span></a>
<a name="l5953"><span class="ln">5953 </span></a>
<a name="l5954"><span class="ln">5954 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment</span>
<a name="l5955"><span class="ln">5955 </span></a><span class="s0">were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had</span>
<a name="l5956"><span class="ln">5956 </span></a><span class="s0">seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side,</span>
<a name="l5957"><span class="ln">5957 </span></a><span class="s0">he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on</span>
<a name="l5958"><span class="ln">5958 </span></a><span class="s0">business with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so</span>
<a name="l5959"><span class="ln">5959 </span></a><span class="s0">openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room,</span>
<a name="l5960"><span class="ln">5960 </span></a><span class="s0">but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma.</span>
<a name="l5961"><span class="ln">5961 </span></a><span class="s0">He had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great</span>
<a name="l5962"><span class="ln">5962 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasure in marking an improvement.</span>
<a name="l5963"><span class="ln">5963 </span></a>
<a name="l5964"><span class="ln">5964 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A very pleasant evening,&quot; he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l5965"><span class="ln">5965 </span></a><span class="s0">had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood,</span>
<a name="l5966"><span class="ln">5966 </span></a><span class="s0">and the papers swept away;--&quot;particularly pleasant.  You and Miss</span>
<a name="l5967"><span class="ln">5967 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax gave us some very good music.  I do not know a more</span>
<a name="l5968"><span class="ln">5968 </span></a><span class="s0">luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained</span>
<a name="l5969"><span class="ln">5969 </span></a><span class="s0">a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music</span>
<a name="l5970"><span class="ln">5970 </span></a><span class="s0">and sometimes with conversation.  I am sure Miss Fairfax must</span>
<a name="l5971"><span class="ln">5971 </span></a><span class="s0">have found the evening pleasant, Emma.  You left nothing undone.</span>
<a name="l5972"><span class="ln">5972 </span></a><span class="s0">I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument</span>
<a name="l5973"><span class="ln">5973 </span></a><span class="s0">at her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5974"><span class="ln">5974 </span></a>
<a name="l5975"><span class="ln">5975 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am happy you approved,&quot; said Emma, smiling; &quot;but I hope I am</span>
<a name="l5976"><span class="ln">5976 </span></a><span class="s0">not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5977"><span class="ln">5977 </span></a>
<a name="l5978"><span class="ln">5978 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, my dear,&quot; said her father instantly; &quot;_that_ I am sure you</span>
<a name="l5979"><span class="ln">5979 </span></a><span class="s0">are not.  There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are.</span>
<a name="l5980"><span class="ln">5980 </span></a><span class="s0">If any thing, you are too attentive.  The muffin last night--if it</span>
<a name="l5981"><span class="ln">5981 </span></a><span class="s0">had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5982"><span class="ln">5982 </span></a>
<a name="l5983"><span class="ln">5983 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot; said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; &quot;you are not</span>
<a name="l5984"><span class="ln">5984 </span></a><span class="s0">often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension.</span>
<a name="l5985"><span class="ln">5985 </span></a><span class="s0">I think you understand me, therefore.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5986"><span class="ln">5986 </span></a>
<a name="l5987"><span class="ln">5987 </span></a><span class="s0">An arch look expressed--&quot;I understand you well enough;&quot; but she</span>
<a name="l5988"><span class="ln">5988 </span></a><span class="s0">said only, &quot;Miss Fairfax is reserved.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5989"><span class="ln">5989 </span></a>
<a name="l5990"><span class="ln">5990 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome</span>
<a name="l5991"><span class="ln">5991 </span></a><span class="s0">all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that</span>
<a name="l5992"><span class="ln">5992 </span></a><span class="s0">has its foundation in diffidence.  What arises from discretion</span>
<a name="l5993"><span class="ln">5993 </span></a><span class="s0">must be honoured.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5994"><span class="ln">5994 </span></a>
<a name="l5995"><span class="ln">5995 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You think her diffident.  I do not see it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l5996"><span class="ln">5996 </span></a>
<a name="l5997"><span class="ln">5997 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Emma,&quot; said he, moving from his chair into one close</span>
<a name="l5998"><span class="ln">5998 </span></a><span class="s0">by her, &quot;you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you</span>
<a name="l5999"><span class="ln">5999 </span></a><span class="s0">had not a pleasant evening.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6000"><span class="ln">6000 </span></a>
<a name="l6001"><span class="ln">6001 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;</span>
<a name="l6002"><span class="ln">6002 </span></a><span class="s0">and amused to think how little information I obtained.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6003"><span class="ln">6003 </span></a>
<a name="l6004"><span class="ln">6004 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am disappointed,&quot; was his only answer.</span>
<a name="l6005"><span class="ln">6005 </span></a>
<a name="l6006"><span class="ln">6006 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope every body had a pleasant evening,&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l6007"><span class="ln">6007 </span></a><span class="s0">in his quiet way.  &quot;I had.  Once, I felt the fire rather too much;</span>
<a name="l6008"><span class="ln">6008 </span></a><span class="s0">but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did</span>
<a name="l6009"><span class="ln">6009 </span></a><span class="s0">not disturb me.  Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured,</span>
<a name="l6010"><span class="ln">6010 </span></a><span class="s0">as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick.  However,</span>
<a name="l6011"><span class="ln">6011 </span></a><span class="s0">she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way.</span>
<a name="l6012"><span class="ln">6012 </span></a><span class="s0">I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of</span>
<a name="l6013"><span class="ln">6013 </span></a><span class="s0">young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed.</span>
<a name="l6014"><span class="ln">6014 </span></a><span class="s0">She must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she</span>
<a name="l6015"><span class="ln">6015 </span></a><span class="s0">had Emma.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6016"><span class="ln">6016 </span></a>
<a name="l6017"><span class="ln">6017 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6018"><span class="ln">6018 </span></a>
<a name="l6019"><span class="ln">6019 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for</span>
<a name="l6020"><span class="ln">6020 </span></a><span class="s0">the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--</span>
<a name="l6021"><span class="ln">6021 </span></a>
<a name="l6022"><span class="ln">6022 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.</span>
<a name="l6023"><span class="ln">6023 </span></a><span class="s0">I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6024"><span class="ln">6024 </span></a>
<a name="l6025"><span class="ln">6025 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared</span>
<a name="l6026"><span class="ln">6026 </span></a><span class="s0">to express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l6027"><span class="ln">6027 </span></a><span class="s0">whose thoughts were on the Bates's, said--</span>
<a name="l6028"><span class="ln">6028 </span></a>
<a name="l6029"><span class="ln">6029 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined!</span>
<a name="l6030"><span class="ln">6030 </span></a><span class="s0">a great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one</span>
<a name="l6031"><span class="ln">6031 </span></a><span class="s0">can venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--</span>
<a name="l6032"><span class="ln">6032 </span></a><span class="s0">Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them</span>
<a name="l6033"><span class="ln">6033 </span></a><span class="s0">a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is</span>
<a name="l6034"><span class="ln">6034 </span></a><span class="s0">not like any other pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma,</span>
<a name="l6035"><span class="ln">6035 </span></a><span class="s0">unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried,</span>
<a name="l6036"><span class="ln">6036 </span></a><span class="s0">as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it,</span>
<a name="l6037"><span class="ln">6037 </span></a><span class="s0">for no stomach can bear roast pork--I think we had better send the leg--</span>
<a name="l6038"><span class="ln">6038 </span></a><span class="s0">do not you think so, my dear?&quot;</span>
<a name="l6039"><span class="ln">6039 </span></a>
<a name="l6040"><span class="ln">6040 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.</span>
<a name="l6041"><span class="ln">6041 </span></a><span class="s0">There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,</span>
<a name="l6042"><span class="ln">6042 </span></a><span class="s0">and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6043"><span class="ln">6043 </span></a>
<a name="l6044"><span class="ln">6044 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That's right, my dear, very right.  I had not thought of it before,</span>
<a name="l6045"><span class="ln">6045 </span></a><span class="s0">but that is the best way.  They must not over-salt the leg; and then,</span>
<a name="l6046"><span class="ln">6046 </span></a><span class="s0">if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled,</span>
<a name="l6047"><span class="ln">6047 </span></a><span class="s0">just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a</span>
<a name="l6048"><span class="ln">6048 </span></a><span class="s0">boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider</span>
<a name="l6049"><span class="ln">6049 </span></a><span class="s0">it unwholesome.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6050"><span class="ln">6050 </span></a>
<a name="l6051"><span class="ln">6051 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Emma,&quot; said Mr. Knightley presently, &quot;I have a piece of news for you.</span>
<a name="l6052"><span class="ln">6052 </span></a><span class="s0">You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think</span>
<a name="l6053"><span class="ln">6053 </span></a><span class="s0">will interest you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6054"><span class="ln">6054 </span></a>
<a name="l6055"><span class="ln">6055 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;News!  Oh! yes, I always like news.  What is it?--why do you</span>
<a name="l6056"><span class="ln">6056 </span></a><span class="s0">smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?&quot;</span>
<a name="l6057"><span class="ln">6057 </span></a>
<a name="l6058"><span class="ln">6058 </span></a><span class="s0">He had time only to say,</span>
<a name="l6059"><span class="ln">6059 </span></a>
<a name="l6060"><span class="ln">6060 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,&quot; when the door</span>
<a name="l6061"><span class="ln">6061 </span></a><span class="s0">was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room.</span>
<a name="l6062"><span class="ln">6062 </span></a><span class="s0">Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to</span>
<a name="l6063"><span class="ln">6063 </span></a><span class="s0">give quickest.  Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment,</span>
<a name="l6064"><span class="ln">6064 </span></a><span class="s0">and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him.</span>
<a name="l6065"><span class="ln">6065 </span></a>
<a name="l6066"><span class="ln">6066 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning?  My dear Miss Woodhouse--</span>
<a name="l6067"><span class="ln">6067 </span></a><span class="s0">I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork!</span>
<a name="l6068"><span class="ln">6068 </span></a><span class="s0">You are too bountiful!  Have you heard the news?  Mr. Elton is going</span>
<a name="l6069"><span class="ln">6069 </span></a><span class="s0">to be married.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6070"><span class="ln">6070 </span></a>
<a name="l6071"><span class="ln">6071 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was</span>
<a name="l6072"><span class="ln">6072 </span></a><span class="s0">so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start,</span>
<a name="l6073"><span class="ln">6073 </span></a><span class="s0">and a little blush, at the sound.</span>
<a name="l6074"><span class="ln">6074 </span></a>
<a name="l6075"><span class="ln">6075 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,&quot;</span>
<a name="l6076"><span class="ln">6076 </span></a><span class="s0">said Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction</span>
<a name="l6077"><span class="ln">6077 </span></a><span class="s0">of some part of what had passed between them.</span>
<a name="l6078"><span class="ln">6078 </span></a>
<a name="l6079"><span class="ln">6079 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But where could _you_ hear it?&quot; cried Miss Bates.  &quot;Where could</span>
<a name="l6080"><span class="ln">6080 </span></a><span class="s0">you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley?  For it is not five minutes</span>
<a name="l6081"><span class="ln">6081 </span></a><span class="s0">since I received Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--</span>
<a name="l6082"><span class="ln">6082 </span></a><span class="s0">or at least ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready</span>
<a name="l6083"><span class="ln">6083 </span></a><span class="s0">to come out--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about</span>
<a name="l6084"><span class="ln">6084 </span></a><span class="s0">the pork--Jane was standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?--</span>
<a name="l6085"><span class="ln">6085 </span></a><span class="s0">for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan</span>
<a name="l6086"><span class="ln">6086 </span></a><span class="s0">large enough.  So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said,</span>
<a name="l6087"><span class="ln">6087 </span></a><span class="s0">`Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold,</span>
<a name="l6088"><span class="ln">6088 </span></a><span class="s0">and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--`Oh! my dear,'</span>
<a name="l6089"><span class="ln">6089 </span></a><span class="s0">said I--well, and just then came the note.  A Miss Hawkins--</span>
<a name="l6090"><span class="ln">6090 </span></a><span class="s0">that's all I know.  A Miss Hawkins of Bath.  But, Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l6091"><span class="ln">6091 </span></a><span class="s0">how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole</span>
<a name="l6092"><span class="ln">6092 </span></a><span class="s0">told Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me.  A Miss Hawkins--&quot;</span>
<a name="l6093"><span class="ln">6093 </span></a>
<a name="l6094"><span class="ln">6094 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago.</span>
<a name="l6095"><span class="ln">6095 </span></a><span class="s0">He had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it</span>
<a name="l6096"><span class="ln">6096 </span></a><span class="s0">to me directly.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6097"><span class="ln">6097 </span></a>
<a name="l6098"><span class="ln">6098 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more</span>
<a name="l6099"><span class="ln">6099 </span></a><span class="s0">generally interesting.  My dear sir, you really are too bountiful.</span>
<a name="l6100"><span class="ln">6100 </span></a><span class="s0">My mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a</span>
<a name="l6101"><span class="ln">6101 </span></a><span class="s0">thousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6102"><span class="ln">6102 </span></a>
<a name="l6103"><span class="ln">6103 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We consider our Hartfield pork,&quot; replied Mr. Woodhouse--&quot;indeed it</span>
<a name="l6104"><span class="ln">6104 </span></a><span class="s0">certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I</span>
<a name="l6105"><span class="ln">6105 </span></a><span class="s0">cannot have a greater pleasure than--&quot;</span>
<a name="l6106"><span class="ln">6106 </span></a>
<a name="l6107"><span class="ln">6107 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good</span>
<a name="l6108"><span class="ln">6108 </span></a><span class="s0">to us.  If ever there were people who, without having great wealth</span>
<a name="l6109"><span class="ln">6109 </span></a><span class="s0">themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.</span>
<a name="l6110"><span class="ln">6110 </span></a><span class="s0">We may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.'</span>
<a name="l6111"><span class="ln">6111 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--&quot;</span>
<a name="l6112"><span class="ln">6112 </span></a>
<a name="l6113"><span class="ln">6113 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l6114"><span class="ln">6114 </span></a><span class="s0">Here was a sly glance at Emma.  &quot;He had been so fortunate as to--</span>
<a name="l6115"><span class="ln">6115 </span></a><span class="s0">I forget the precise words--one has no business to remember them.</span>
<a name="l6116"><span class="ln">6116 </span></a><span class="s0">The information was, as you state, that he was going to be married</span>
<a name="l6117"><span class="ln">6117 </span></a><span class="s0">to a Miss Hawkins.  By his style, I should imagine it just settled.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6118"><span class="ln">6118 </span></a>
<a name="l6119"><span class="ln">6119 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Elton going to be married!&quot; said Emma, as soon as she could speak.</span>
<a name="l6120"><span class="ln">6120 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He will have every body's wishes for his happiness.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6121"><span class="ln">6121 </span></a>
<a name="l6122"><span class="ln">6122 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He is very young to settle,&quot; was Mr. Woodhouse's observation.</span>
<a name="l6123"><span class="ln">6123 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He had better not be in a hurry.  He seemed to me very well off</span>
<a name="l6124"><span class="ln">6124 </span></a><span class="s0">as he was.  We were always glad to see him at Hartfield.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6125"><span class="ln">6125 </span></a>
<a name="l6126"><span class="ln">6126 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!&quot; said Miss Bates,</span>
<a name="l6127"><span class="ln">6127 </span></a><span class="s0">joyfully; &quot;my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot</span>
<a name="l6128"><span class="ln">6128 </span></a><span class="s0">bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress.</span>
<a name="l6129"><span class="ln">6129 </span></a><span class="s0">This is great news, indeed.  Jane, you have never seen</span>
<a name="l6130"><span class="ln">6130 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6131"><span class="ln">6131 </span></a>
<a name="l6132"><span class="ln">6132 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly</span>
<a name="l6133"><span class="ln">6133 </span></a><span class="s0">to occupy her.</span>
<a name="l6134"><span class="ln">6134 </span></a>
<a name="l6135"><span class="ln">6135 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,&quot; she replied, starting on this appeal;</span>
<a name="l6136"><span class="ln">6136 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;is he--is he a tall man?&quot;</span>
<a name="l6137"><span class="ln">6137 </span></a>
<a name="l6138"><span class="ln">6138 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Who shall answer that question?&quot; cried Emma.  &quot;My father would</span>
<a name="l6139"><span class="ln">6139 </span></a><span class="s0">say `yes,' Mr. Knightley `no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is</span>
<a name="l6140"><span class="ln">6140 </span></a><span class="s0">just the happy medium.  When you have been here a little longer,</span>
<a name="l6141"><span class="ln">6141 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard</span>
<a name="l6142"><span class="ln">6142 </span></a><span class="s0">of perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6143"><span class="ln">6143 </span></a>
<a name="l6144"><span class="ln">6144 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will.  He is the very best</span>
<a name="l6145"><span class="ln">6145 </span></a><span class="s0">young man--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday</span>
<a name="l6146"><span class="ln">6146 </span></a><span class="s0">he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry.  Miss Hawkins,--I dare say,</span>
<a name="l6147"><span class="ln">6147 </span></a><span class="s0">an excellent young woman.  His extreme attention to my mother--</span>
<a name="l6148"><span class="ln">6148 </span></a><span class="s0">wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better,</span>
<a name="l6149"><span class="ln">6149 </span></a><span class="s0">for my mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she</span>
<a name="l6150"><span class="ln">6150 </span></a><span class="s0">does not hear quite quick.  Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a</span>
<a name="l6151"><span class="ln">6151 </span></a><span class="s0">little deaf.  He fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--</span>
<a name="l6152"><span class="ln">6152 </span></a><span class="s0">but she says it did him no lasting benefit.  Colonel Campbell,</span>
<a name="l6153"><span class="ln">6153 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, is quite our angel.  And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming</span>
<a name="l6154"><span class="ln">6154 </span></a><span class="s0">young man, quite worthy of him.  It is such a happiness when good</span>
<a name="l6155"><span class="ln">6155 </span></a><span class="s0">people get together--and they always do.  Now, here will be Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l6156"><span class="ln">6156 </span></a><span class="s0">and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people;</span>
<a name="l6157"><span class="ln">6157 </span></a><span class="s0">and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple</span>
<a name="l6158"><span class="ln">6158 </span></a><span class="s0">than Mr. and Mrs. Perry.  I say, sir,&quot; turning to Mr. Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l6159"><span class="ln">6159 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I think there are few places with such society as Highbury.</span>
<a name="l6160"><span class="ln">6160 </span></a><span class="s0">I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir,</span>
<a name="l6161"><span class="ln">6161 </span></a><span class="s0">if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork--</span>
<a name="l6162"><span class="ln">6162 </span></a><span class="s0">a roast loin of pork--&quot;</span>
<a name="l6163"><span class="ln">6163 </span></a>
<a name="l6164"><span class="ln">6164 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been</span>
<a name="l6165"><span class="ln">6165 </span></a><span class="s0">acquainted with her,&quot; said Emma, &quot;nothing I suppose can be known.</span>
<a name="l6166"><span class="ln">6166 </span></a><span class="s0">One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance.  He has been</span>
<a name="l6167"><span class="ln">6167 </span></a><span class="s0">gone only four weeks.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6168"><span class="ln">6168 </span></a>
<a name="l6169"><span class="ln">6169 </span></a><span class="s0">Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,</span>
<a name="l6170"><span class="ln">6170 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma said,</span>
<a name="l6171"><span class="ln">6171 </span></a>
<a name="l6172"><span class="ln">6172 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take</span>
<a name="l6173"><span class="ln">6173 </span></a><span class="s0">an interest in this news.  You, who have been hearing and seeing</span>
<a name="l6174"><span class="ln">6174 </span></a><span class="s0">so much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep</span>
<a name="l6175"><span class="ln">6175 </span></a><span class="s0">in the business on Miss Campbell's account--we shall not excuse</span>
<a name="l6176"><span class="ln">6176 </span></a><span class="s0">your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6177"><span class="ln">6177 </span></a>
<a name="l6178"><span class="ln">6178 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;When I have seen Mr. Elton,&quot; replied Jane, &quot;I dare say I</span>
<a name="l6179"><span class="ln">6179 </span></a><span class="s0">shall be interested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me.</span>
<a name="l6180"><span class="ln">6180 </span></a><span class="s0">And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression</span>
<a name="l6181"><span class="ln">6181 </span></a><span class="s0">may be a little worn off.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6182"><span class="ln">6182 </span></a>
<a name="l6183"><span class="ln">6183 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,&quot;</span>
<a name="l6184"><span class="ln">6184 </span></a><span class="s0">said Miss Bates, &quot;four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had</span>
<a name="l6185"><span class="ln">6185 </span></a><span class="s0">always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts;</span>
<a name="l6186"><span class="ln">6186 </span></a><span class="s0">not that I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said,</span>
<a name="l6187"><span class="ln">6187 </span></a><span class="s0">`No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man--but'--In short, I do</span>
<a name="l6188"><span class="ln">6188 </span></a><span class="s0">not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries.</span>
<a name="l6189"><span class="ln">6189 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not pretend to it.  What is before me, I see.  At the same time,</span>
<a name="l6190"><span class="ln">6190 </span></a><span class="s0">nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l6191"><span class="ln">6191 </span></a><span class="s0">lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not</span>
<a name="l6192"><span class="ln">6192 </span></a><span class="s0">offend for the world.  How does Miss Smith do?  She seems quite</span>
<a name="l6193"><span class="ln">6193 </span></a><span class="s0">recovered now.  Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately?</span>
<a name="l6194"><span class="ln">6194 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! those dear little children.  Jane, do you know I always fancy</span>
<a name="l6195"><span class="ln">6195 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley.  I mean in person--tall, and with</span>
<a name="l6196"><span class="ln">6196 </span></a><span class="s0">that sort of look--and not very talkative.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6197"><span class="ln">6197 </span></a>
<a name="l6198"><span class="ln">6198 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6199"><span class="ln">6199 </span></a>
<a name="l6200"><span class="ln">6200 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.</span>
<a name="l6201"><span class="ln">6201 </span></a><span class="s0">One takes up a notion, and runs away with it.  Mr. Dixon, you say,</span>
<a name="l6202"><span class="ln">6202 </span></a><span class="s0">is not, strictly speaking, handsome?&quot;</span>
<a name="l6203"><span class="ln">6203 </span></a>
<a name="l6204"><span class="ln">6204 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Handsome!  Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain.  I told you he</span>
<a name="l6205"><span class="ln">6205 </span></a><span class="s0">was plain.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6206"><span class="ln">6206 </span></a>
<a name="l6207"><span class="ln">6207 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,</span>
<a name="l6208"><span class="ln">6208 </span></a><span class="s0">and that you yourself--&quot;</span>
<a name="l6209"><span class="ln">6209 </span></a>
<a name="l6210"><span class="ln">6210 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing.  Where I have a regard,</span>
<a name="l6211"><span class="ln">6211 </span></a><span class="s0">I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed</span>
<a name="l6212"><span class="ln">6212 </span></a><span class="s0">the general opinion, when I called him plain.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6213"><span class="ln">6213 </span></a>
<a name="l6214"><span class="ln">6214 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away.</span>
<a name="l6215"><span class="ln">6215 </span></a><span class="s0">The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy.</span>
<a name="l6216"><span class="ln">6216 </span></a><span class="s0">You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must</span>
<a name="l6217"><span class="ln">6217 </span></a><span class="s0">take leave.  This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed.</span>
<a name="l6218"><span class="ln">6218 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes:</span>
<a name="l6219"><span class="ln">6219 </span></a><span class="s0">and, Jane, you had better go home directly--I would not have you</span>
<a name="l6220"><span class="ln">6220 </span></a><span class="s0">out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already.</span>
<a name="l6221"><span class="ln">6221 </span></a><span class="s0">Thank you, we do indeed.  I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard,</span>
<a name="l6222"><span class="ln">6222 </span></a><span class="s0">for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork:</span>
<a name="l6223"><span class="ln">6223 </span></a><span class="s0">when we dress the leg it will be another thing.  Good morning to you,</span>
<a name="l6224"><span class="ln">6224 </span></a><span class="s0">my dear sir.  Oh!  Mr. Knightley is coming too.  Well, that is</span>
<a name="l6225"><span class="ln">6225 </span></a><span class="s0">so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to</span>
<a name="l6226"><span class="ln">6226 </span></a><span class="s0">give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning</span>
<a name="l6227"><span class="ln">6227 </span></a><span class="s0">to you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6228"><span class="ln">6228 </span></a>
<a name="l6229"><span class="ln">6229 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him</span>
<a name="l6230"><span class="ln">6230 </span></a><span class="s0">while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--</span>
<a name="l6231"><span class="ln">6231 </span></a><span class="s0">and to marry strangers too--and the other half she could give</span>
<a name="l6232"><span class="ln">6232 </span></a><span class="s0">to her own view of the subject.  It was to herself an amusing</span>
<a name="l6233"><span class="ln">6233 </span></a><span class="s0">and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l6234"><span class="ln">6234 </span></a><span class="s0">could not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet:</span>
<a name="l6235"><span class="ln">6235 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet must feel it--and all that she could hope was, by giving</span>
<a name="l6236"><span class="ln">6236 </span></a><span class="s0">the first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly</span>
<a name="l6237"><span class="ln">6237 </span></a><span class="s0">from others.  It was now about the time that she was likely to call.</span>
<a name="l6238"><span class="ln">6238 </span></a><span class="s0">If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning</span>
<a name="l6239"><span class="ln">6239 </span></a><span class="s0">to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be</span>
<a name="l6240"><span class="ln">6240 </span></a><span class="s0">detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would</span>
<a name="l6241"><span class="ln">6241 </span></a><span class="s0">undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.</span>
<a name="l6242"><span class="ln">6242 </span></a>
<a name="l6243"><span class="ln">6243 </span></a><span class="s0">The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,</span>
<a name="l6244"><span class="ln">6244 </span></a><span class="s0">when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which</span>
<a name="l6245"><span class="ln">6245 </span></a><span class="s0">hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the</span>
<a name="l6246"><span class="ln">6246 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!&quot; which instantly</span>
<a name="l6247"><span class="ln">6247 </span></a><span class="s0">burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation.</span>
<a name="l6248"><span class="ln">6248 </span></a><span class="s0">As the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater</span>
<a name="l6249"><span class="ln">6249 </span></a><span class="s0">kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly</span>
<a name="l6250"><span class="ln">6250 </span></a><span class="s0">through what she had to tell.  &quot;She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's</span>
<a name="l6251"><span class="ln">6251 </span></a><span class="s0">half an hour ago--she had been afraid it would rain--she had been</span>
<a name="l6252"><span class="ln">6252 </span></a><span class="s0">afraid it would pour down every moment--but she thought she might</span>
<a name="l6253"><span class="ln">6253 </span></a><span class="s0">get to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible;</span>
<a name="l6254"><span class="ln">6254 </span></a><span class="s0">but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman</span>
<a name="l6255"><span class="ln">6255 </span></a><span class="s0">was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step</span>
<a name="l6256"><span class="ln">6256 </span></a><span class="s0">in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay</span>
<a name="l6257"><span class="ln">6257 </span></a><span class="s0">half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,</span>
<a name="l6258"><span class="ln">6258 </span></a><span class="s0">and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast</span>
<a name="l6259"><span class="ln">6259 </span></a><span class="s0">as she could, and took shelter at Ford's.&quot;--Ford's was the principal</span>
<a name="l6260"><span class="ln">6260 </span></a><span class="s0">woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united;</span>
<a name="l6261"><span class="ln">6261 </span></a><span class="s0">the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--&quot;And so,</span>
<a name="l6262"><span class="ln">6262 </span></a><span class="s0">there she had set, without an idea of any thing in the world,</span>
<a name="l6263"><span class="ln">6263 </span></a><span class="s0">full ten minutes, perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--</span>
<a name="l6264"><span class="ln">6264 </span></a><span class="s0">to be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--</span>
<a name="l6265"><span class="ln">6265 </span></a><span class="s0">who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!--</span>
<a name="l6266"><span class="ln">6266 </span></a><span class="s0">Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think.  I thought I should have fainted.</span>
<a name="l6267"><span class="ln">6267 </span></a><span class="s0">I did not know what to do.  I was sitting near the door--Elizabeth saw</span>
<a name="l6268"><span class="ln">6268 </span></a><span class="s0">me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella.</span>
<a name="l6269"><span class="ln">6269 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took</span>
<a name="l6270"><span class="ln">6270 </span></a><span class="s0">no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop;</span>
<a name="l6271"><span class="ln">6271 </span></a><span class="s0">and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!</span>
<a name="l6272"><span class="ln">6272 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure I must have been as white as my gown.  I could not go away</span>
<a name="l6273"><span class="ln">6273 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere</span>
<a name="l6274"><span class="ln">6274 </span></a><span class="s0">in the world but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last,</span>
<a name="l6275"><span class="ln">6275 </span></a><span class="s0">I fancy, he looked round and saw me; for instead of going</span>
<a name="l6276"><span class="ln">6276 </span></a><span class="s0">on with her buyings, they began whispering to one another.</span>
<a name="l6277"><span class="ln">6277 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking</span>
<a name="l6278"><span class="ln">6278 </span></a><span class="s0">that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was,</span>
<a name="l6279"><span class="ln">6279 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came quite up</span>
<a name="l6280"><span class="ln">6280 </span></a><span class="s0">to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,</span>
<a name="l6281"><span class="ln">6281 </span></a><span class="s0">if I would.  She did not do any of it in the same way that she used;</span>
<a name="l6282"><span class="ln">6282 </span></a><span class="s0">I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be</span>
<a name="l6283"><span class="ln">6283 </span></a><span class="s0">very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time;</span>
<a name="l6284"><span class="ln">6284 </span></a><span class="s0">but I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember</span>
<a name="l6285"><span class="ln">6285 </span></a><span class="s0">she said she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost</span>
<a name="l6286"><span class="ln">6286 </span></a><span class="s0">too kind!  Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable!</span>
<a name="l6287"><span class="ln">6287 </span></a><span class="s0">By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined</span>
<a name="l6288"><span class="ln">6288 </span></a><span class="s0">that nothing should stop me from getting away--and then--only think!--</span>
<a name="l6289"><span class="ln">6289 </span></a><span class="s0">I found he was coming up towards me too--slowly you know, and as</span>
<a name="l6290"><span class="ln">6290 </span></a><span class="s0">if he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke,</span>
<a name="l6291"><span class="ln">6291 </span></a><span class="s0">and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully,</span>
<a name="l6292"><span class="ln">6292 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and said it</span>
<a name="l6293"><span class="ln">6293 </span></a><span class="s0">did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got</span>
<a name="l6294"><span class="ln">6294 </span></a><span class="s0">three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say,</span>
<a name="l6295"><span class="ln">6295 </span></a><span class="s0">if I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round</span>
<a name="l6296"><span class="ln">6296 </span></a><span class="s0">by Mr. Cole's stables, for I should find the near way quite floated</span>
<a name="l6297"><span class="ln">6297 </span></a><span class="s0">by this rain.  Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me!</span>
<a name="l6298"><span class="ln">6298 </span></a><span class="s0">So I said, I was very much obliged to him:  you know I could</span>
<a name="l6299"><span class="ln">6299 </span></a><span class="s0">not do less; and then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round</span>
<a name="l6300"><span class="ln">6300 </span></a><span class="s0">by the stables--I believe I did--but I hardly knew where I was,</span>
<a name="l6301"><span class="ln">6301 </span></a><span class="s0">or any thing about it.  Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done</span>
<a name="l6302"><span class="ln">6302 </span></a><span class="s0">any thing than have it happen:  and yet, you know, there was a sort</span>
<a name="l6303"><span class="ln">6303 </span></a><span class="s0">of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly.</span>
<a name="l6304"><span class="ln">6304 </span></a><span class="s0">And Elizabeth, too.  Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and make</span>
<a name="l6305"><span class="ln">6305 </span></a><span class="s0">me comfortable again.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6306"><span class="ln">6306 </span></a>
<a name="l6307"><span class="ln">6307 </span></a><span class="s0">Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in</span>
<a name="l6308"><span class="ln">6308 </span></a><span class="s0">her power.  She was obliged to stop and think.  She was not thoroughly</span>
<a name="l6309"><span class="ln">6309 </span></a><span class="s0">comfortable herself.  The young man's conduct, and his sister's,</span>
<a name="l6310"><span class="ln">6310 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them.</span>
<a name="l6311"><span class="ln">6311 </span></a><span class="s0">As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture</span>
<a name="l6312"><span class="ln">6312 </span></a><span class="s0">of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour.</span>
<a name="l6313"><span class="ln">6313 </span></a><span class="s0">But she had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before;</span>
<a name="l6314"><span class="ln">6314 </span></a><span class="s0">and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?</span>
<a name="l6315"><span class="ln">6315 </span></a><span class="s0">It was folly to be disturbed by it.  Of course, he must be sorry</span>
<a name="l6316"><span class="ln">6316 </span></a><span class="s0">to lose her--they must be all sorry.  Ambition, as well as love,</span>
<a name="l6317"><span class="ln">6317 </span></a><span class="s0">had probably been mortified.  They might all have hoped to rise</span>
<a name="l6318"><span class="ln">6318 </span></a><span class="s0">by Harriet's acquaintance:  and besides, what was the value of</span>
<a name="l6319"><span class="ln">6319 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--</span>
<a name="l6320"><span class="ln">6320 </span></a><span class="s0">what signified her praise?</span>
<a name="l6321"><span class="ln">6321 </span></a>
<a name="l6322"><span class="ln">6322 </span></a><span class="s0">She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable,</span>
<a name="l6323"><span class="ln">6323 </span></a><span class="s0">by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite</span>
<a name="l6324"><span class="ln">6324 </span></a><span class="s0">unworthy of being dwelt on,</span>
<a name="l6325"><span class="ln">6325 </span></a>
<a name="l6326"><span class="ln">6326 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It might be distressing, for the moment,&quot; said she; &quot;but you seem</span>
<a name="l6327"><span class="ln">6327 </span></a><span class="s0">to have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--</span>
<a name="l6328"><span class="ln">6328 </span></a><span class="s0">can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need</span>
<a name="l6329"><span class="ln">6329 </span></a><span class="s0">not think about it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6330"><span class="ln">6330 </span></a>
<a name="l6331"><span class="ln">6331 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet said, &quot;very true,&quot; and she &quot;would not think about it;&quot;</span>
<a name="l6332"><span class="ln">6332 </span></a><span class="s0">but still she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else;</span>
<a name="l6333"><span class="ln">6333 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head,</span>
<a name="l6334"><span class="ln">6334 </span></a><span class="s0">was obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give</span>
<a name="l6335"><span class="ln">6335 </span></a><span class="s0">with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether</span>
<a name="l6336"><span class="ln">6336 </span></a><span class="s0">to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state</span>
<a name="l6337"><span class="ln">6337 </span></a><span class="s0">of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of Mr. Elton's importance</span>
<a name="l6338"><span class="ln">6338 </span></a><span class="s0">with her!</span>
<a name="l6339"><span class="ln">6339 </span></a>
<a name="l6340"><span class="ln">6340 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived.  Though she did not</span>
<a name="l6341"><span class="ln">6341 </span></a><span class="s0">feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before,</span>
<a name="l6342"><span class="ln">6342 </span></a><span class="s0">or an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their</span>
<a name="l6343"><span class="ln">6343 </span></a><span class="s0">first conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the</span>
<a name="l6344"><span class="ln">6344 </span></a><span class="s0">sensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure,</span>
<a name="l6345"><span class="ln">6345 </span></a><span class="s0">as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place</span>
<a name="l6346"><span class="ln">6346 </span></a><span class="s0">the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy.</span>
<a name="l6347"><span class="ln">6347 </span></a>
<a name="l6348"><span class="ln">6348 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting.</span>
<a name="l6349"><span class="ln">6349 </span></a><span class="s0">It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining</span>
<a name="l6350"><span class="ln">6350 </span></a><span class="s0">any influence to alarm.  As Harriet now lived, the Martins could</span>
<a name="l6351"><span class="ln">6351 </span></a><span class="s0">not get at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted</span>
<a name="l6352"><span class="ln">6352 </span></a><span class="s0">either the courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her</span>
<a name="l6353"><span class="ln">6353 </span></a><span class="s0">refusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's;</span>
<a name="l6354"><span class="ln">6354 </span></a><span class="s0">and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again,</span>
<a name="l6355"><span class="ln">6355 </span></a><span class="s0">with any necessity, or even any power of speech.</span>
<a name="l6356"><span class="ln">6356 </span></a>
<a name="l6357"><span class="ln">6357 </span></a>
<a name="l6358"><span class="ln">6358 </span></a>
<a name="l6359"><span class="ln">6359 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER IV</span>
<a name="l6360"><span class="ln">6360 </span></a>
<a name="l6361"><span class="ln">6361 </span></a>
<a name="l6362"><span class="ln">6362 </span></a><span class="s0">Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in</span>
<a name="l6363"><span class="ln">6363 </span></a><span class="s0">interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries</span>
<a name="l6364"><span class="ln">6364 </span></a><span class="s0">or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.</span>
<a name="l6365"><span class="ln">6365 </span></a>
<a name="l6366"><span class="ln">6366 </span></a><span class="s0">A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first</span>
<a name="l6367"><span class="ln">6367 </span></a><span class="s0">mentioned in Highbury, before she was, by some means or other,</span>
<a name="l6368"><span class="ln">6368 </span></a><span class="s0">discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind;</span>
<a name="l6369"><span class="ln">6369 </span></a><span class="s0">to be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable:</span>
<a name="l6370"><span class="ln">6370 </span></a><span class="s0">and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects,</span>
<a name="l6371"><span class="ln">6371 </span></a><span class="s0">and circulate the fame of her merits, there was very little more</span>
<a name="l6372"><span class="ln">6372 </span></a><span class="s0">for him to do, than to tell her Christian name, and say whose</span>
<a name="l6373"><span class="ln">6373 </span></a><span class="s0">music she principally played.</span>
<a name="l6374"><span class="ln">6374 </span></a>
<a name="l6375"><span class="ln">6375 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man.  He had gone away rejected</span>
<a name="l6376"><span class="ln">6376 </span></a><span class="s0">and mortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series</span>
<a name="l6377"><span class="ln">6377 </span></a><span class="s0">of what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing</span>
<a name="l6378"><span class="ln">6378 </span></a><span class="s0">the right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very</span>
<a name="l6379"><span class="ln">6379 </span></a><span class="s0">wrong one.  He had gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged</span>
<a name="l6380"><span class="ln">6380 </span></a><span class="s0">to another--and to another as superior, of course, to the first,</span>
<a name="l6381"><span class="ln">6381 </span></a><span class="s0">as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost.</span>
<a name="l6382"><span class="ln">6382 </span></a><span class="s0">He came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing</span>
<a name="l6383"><span class="ln">6383 </span></a><span class="s0">for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.</span>
<a name="l6384"><span class="ln">6384 </span></a>
<a name="l6385"><span class="ln">6385 </span></a><span class="s0">The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages</span>
<a name="l6386"><span class="ln">6386 </span></a><span class="s0">of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,</span>
<a name="l6387"><span class="ln">6387 </span></a><span class="s0">of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of</span>
<a name="l6388"><span class="ln">6388 </span></a><span class="s0">some dignity, as well as some convenience:  the story told well;</span>
<a name="l6389"><span class="ln">6389 </span></a><span class="s0">he had not thrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l.</span>
<a name="l6390"><span class="ln">6390 </span></a><span class="s0">or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--</span>
<a name="l6391"><span class="ln">6391 </span></a><span class="s0">the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by</span>
<a name="l6392"><span class="ln">6392 </span></a><span class="s0">distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole</span>
<a name="l6393"><span class="ln">6393 </span></a><span class="s0">of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious--the steps</span>
<a name="l6394"><span class="ln">6394 </span></a><span class="s0">so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's,</span>
<a name="l6395"><span class="ln">6395 </span></a><span class="s0">and the party at Mrs. Brown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--</span>
<a name="l6396"><span class="ln">6396 </span></a><span class="s0">with consciousness and agitation richly scattered--the lady</span>
<a name="l6397"><span class="ln">6397 </span></a><span class="s0">had been so easily impressed--so sweetly disposed--had in short,</span>
<a name="l6398"><span class="ln">6398 </span></a><span class="s0">to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him,</span>
<a name="l6399"><span class="ln">6399 </span></a><span class="s0">that vanity and prudence were equally contented.</span>
<a name="l6400"><span class="ln">6400 </span></a>
<a name="l6401"><span class="ln">6401 </span></a><span class="s0">He had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection,</span>
<a name="l6402"><span class="ln">6402 </span></a><span class="s0">and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself</span>
<a name="l6403"><span class="ln">6403 </span></a><span class="s0">and his own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be</span>
<a name="l6404"><span class="ln">6404 </span></a><span class="s0">laughed at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing</span>
<a name="l6405"><span class="ln">6405 </span></a><span class="s0">all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago,</span>
<a name="l6406"><span class="ln">6406 </span></a><span class="s0">he would have been more cautiously gallant.</span>
<a name="l6407"><span class="ln">6407 </span></a>
<a name="l6408"><span class="ln">6408 </span></a><span class="s0">The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves</span>
<a name="l6409"><span class="ln">6409 </span></a><span class="s0">to please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for;</span>
<a name="l6410"><span class="ln">6410 </span></a><span class="s0">and when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation,</span>
<a name="l6411"><span class="ln">6411 </span></a><span class="s0">which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict,</span>
<a name="l6412"><span class="ln">6412 </span></a><span class="s0">that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.</span>
<a name="l6413"><span class="ln">6413 </span></a>
<a name="l6414"><span class="ln">6414 </span></a><span class="s0">During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just</span>
<a name="l6415"><span class="ln">6415 </span></a><span class="s0">enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her</span>
<a name="l6416"><span class="ln">6416 </span></a><span class="s0">the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique</span>
<a name="l6417"><span class="ln">6417 </span></a><span class="s0">and pretension, now spread over his air.  She was, in fact,</span>
<a name="l6418"><span class="ln">6418 </span></a><span class="s0">beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing</span>
<a name="l6419"><span class="ln">6419 </span></a><span class="s0">at all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very</span>
<a name="l6420"><span class="ln">6420 </span></a><span class="s0">disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance,</span>
<a name="l6421"><span class="ln">6421 </span></a><span class="s0">a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind,</span>
<a name="l6422"><span class="ln">6422 </span></a><span class="s0">she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again.</span>
<a name="l6423"><span class="ln">6423 </span></a><span class="s0">She wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare</span>
<a name="l6424"><span class="ln">6424 </span></a><span class="s0">twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.</span>
<a name="l6425"><span class="ln">6425 </span></a>
<a name="l6426"><span class="ln">6426 </span></a><span class="s0">The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly</span>
<a name="l6427"><span class="ln">6427 </span></a><span class="s0">be lessened by his marriage.  Many vain solicitudes would be prevented--</span>
<a name="l6428"><span class="ln">6428 </span></a><span class="s0">many awkwardnesses smoothed by it.  A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be an excuse for</span>
<a name="l6429"><span class="ln">6429 </span></a><span class="s0">any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark.</span>
<a name="l6430"><span class="ln">6430 </span></a><span class="s0">It would be almost beginning their life of civility again.</span>
<a name="l6431"><span class="ln">6431 </span></a>
<a name="l6432"><span class="ln">6432 </span></a><span class="s0">Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little.  She was good</span>
<a name="l6433"><span class="ln">6433 </span></a><span class="s0">enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--</span>
<a name="l6434"><span class="ln">6434 </span></a><span class="s0">handsome enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side.</span>
<a name="l6435"><span class="ln">6435 </span></a><span class="s0">As to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded,</span>
<a name="l6436"><span class="ln">6436 </span></a><span class="s0">that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet,</span>
<a name="l6437"><span class="ln">6437 </span></a><span class="s0">he had done nothing.  On that article, truth seemed attainable.</span>
<a name="l6438"><span class="ln">6438 </span></a><span class="s0">_What_ she was, must be uncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out;</span>
<a name="l6439"><span class="ln">6439 </span></a><span class="s0">and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at</span>
<a name="l6440"><span class="ln">6440 </span></a><span class="s0">all Harriet's superior.  She brought no name, no blood, no alliance.</span>
<a name="l6441"><span class="ln">6441 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol--</span>
<a name="l6442"><span class="ln">6442 </span></a><span class="s0">merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of the</span>
<a name="l6443"><span class="ln">6443 </span></a><span class="s0">profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was</span>
<a name="l6444"><span class="ln">6444 </span></a><span class="s0">not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very</span>
<a name="l6445"><span class="ln">6445 </span></a><span class="s0">moderate also.  Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath;</span>
<a name="l6446"><span class="ln">6446 </span></a><span class="s0">but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though</span>
<a name="l6447"><span class="ln">6447 </span></a><span class="s0">the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--</span>
<a name="l6448"><span class="ln">6448 </span></a><span class="s0">in the law line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded</span>
<a name="l6449"><span class="ln">6449 </span></a><span class="s0">of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter</span>
<a name="l6450"><span class="ln">6450 </span></a><span class="s0">had lived.  Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney,</span>
<a name="l6451"><span class="ln">6451 </span></a><span class="s0">and too stupid to rise.  And all the grandeur of the connexion</span>
<a name="l6452"><span class="ln">6452 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_,</span>
<a name="l6453"><span class="ln">6453 </span></a><span class="s0">to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages!</span>
<a name="l6454"><span class="ln">6454 </span></a><span class="s0">That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of</span>
<a name="l6455"><span class="ln">6455 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Hawkins.</span>
<a name="l6456"><span class="ln">6456 </span></a>
<a name="l6457"><span class="ln">6457 </span></a><span class="s0">Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all!</span>
<a name="l6458"><span class="ln">6458 </span></a><span class="s0">She had talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be</span>
<a name="l6459"><span class="ln">6459 </span></a><span class="s0">talked out of it.  The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies</span>
<a name="l6460"><span class="ln">6460 </span></a><span class="s0">of Harriet's mind was not to be talked away.  He might be superseded</span>
<a name="l6461"><span class="ln">6461 </span></a><span class="s0">by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer;</span>
<a name="l6462"><span class="ln">6462 </span></a><span class="s0">even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else,</span>
<a name="l6463"><span class="ln">6463 </span></a><span class="s0">she feared, would cure her.  Harriet was one of those, who,</span>
<a name="l6464"><span class="ln">6464 </span></a><span class="s0">having once begun, would be always in love.  And now, poor girl!</span>
<a name="l6465"><span class="ln">6465 </span></a><span class="s0">she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton.</span>
<a name="l6466"><span class="ln">6466 </span></a><span class="s0">She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other.  Emma saw</span>
<a name="l6467"><span class="ln">6467 </span></a><span class="s0">him only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure</span>
<a name="l6468"><span class="ln">6468 </span></a><span class="s0">_just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss him, _just_ to hear his voice,</span>
<a name="l6469"><span class="ln">6469 </span></a><span class="s0">or see his shoulder, _just_ to have something occur to preserve him</span>
<a name="l6470"><span class="ln">6470 </span></a><span class="s0">in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture.</span>
<a name="l6471"><span class="ln">6471 </span></a><span class="s0">She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting when</span>
<a name="l6472"><span class="ln">6472 </span></a><span class="s0">at Hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton,</span>
<a name="l6473"><span class="ln">6473 </span></a><span class="s0">and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns;</span>
<a name="l6474"><span class="ln">6474 </span></a><span class="s0">and every report, therefore, every guess--all that had already</span>
<a name="l6475"><span class="ln">6475 </span></a><span class="s0">occurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs,</span>
<a name="l6476"><span class="ln">6476 </span></a><span class="s0">comprehending income, servants, and furniture, was continually</span>
<a name="l6477"><span class="ln">6477 </span></a><span class="s0">in agitation around her.  Her regard was receiving strength by</span>
<a name="l6478"><span class="ln">6478 </span></a><span class="s0">invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings</span>
<a name="l6479"><span class="ln">6479 </span></a><span class="s0">irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness,</span>
<a name="l6480"><span class="ln">6480 </span></a><span class="s0">and continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!--</span>
<a name="l6481"><span class="ln">6481 </span></a><span class="s0">his air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his hat,</span>
<a name="l6482"><span class="ln">6482 </span></a><span class="s0">being all in proof of how much he was in love!</span>
<a name="l6483"><span class="ln">6483 </span></a>
<a name="l6484"><span class="ln">6484 </span></a><span class="s0">Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain</span>
<a name="l6485"><span class="ln">6485 </span></a><span class="s0">to her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of</span>
<a name="l6486"><span class="ln">6486 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations.</span>
<a name="l6487"><span class="ln">6487 </span></a><span class="s0">Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each</span>
<a name="l6488"><span class="ln">6488 </span></a><span class="s0">was occasionally useful as a check to the other.  Mr. Elton's</span>
<a name="l6489"><span class="ln">6489 </span></a><span class="s0">engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin.</span>
<a name="l6490"><span class="ln">6490 </span></a><span class="s0">The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been</span>
<a name="l6491"><span class="ln">6491 </span></a><span class="s0">a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's</span>
<a name="l6492"><span class="ln">6492 </span></a><span class="s0">a few days afterwards.  Harriet had not been at home; but a note had</span>
<a name="l6493"><span class="ln">6493 </span></a><span class="s0">been prepared and left for her, written in the very style to touch;</span>
<a name="l6494"><span class="ln">6494 </span></a><span class="s0">a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness;</span>
<a name="l6495"><span class="ln">6495 </span></a><span class="s0">and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much occupied</span>
<a name="l6496"><span class="ln">6496 </span></a><span class="s0">by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,</span>
<a name="l6497"><span class="ln">6497 </span></a><span class="s0">and wishing to do more than she dared to confess.  But Mr. Elton,</span>
<a name="l6498"><span class="ln">6498 </span></a><span class="s0">in person, had driven away all such cares.  While he staid,</span>
<a name="l6499"><span class="ln">6499 </span></a><span class="s0">the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off</span>
<a name="l6500"><span class="ln">6500 </span></a><span class="s0">for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,</span>
<a name="l6501"><span class="ln">6501 </span></a><span class="s0">judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.</span>
<a name="l6502"><span class="ln">6502 </span></a>
<a name="l6503"><span class="ln">6503 </span></a><span class="s0">How that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--</span>
<a name="l6504"><span class="ln">6504 </span></a><span class="s0">and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful</span>
<a name="l6505"><span class="ln">6505 </span></a><span class="s0">consideration.  Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters,</span>
<a name="l6506"><span class="ln">6506 </span></a><span class="s0">when invited to come, would be ingratitude.  It must not be:</span>
<a name="l6507"><span class="ln">6507 </span></a><span class="s0">and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!--</span>
<a name="l6508"><span class="ln">6508 </span></a>
<a name="l6509"><span class="ln">6509 </span></a><span class="s0">After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than Harriet's</span>
<a name="l6510"><span class="ln">6510 </span></a><span class="s0">returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding,</span>
<a name="l6511"><span class="ln">6511 </span></a><span class="s0">should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance.</span>
<a name="l6512"><span class="ln">6512 </span></a><span class="s0">She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey Mill,</span>
<a name="l6513"><span class="ln">6513 </span></a><span class="s0">while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so soon,</span>
<a name="l6514"><span class="ln">6514 </span></a><span class="s0">as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous</span>
<a name="l6515"><span class="ln">6515 </span></a><span class="s0">recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what</span>
<a name="l6516"><span class="ln">6516 </span></a><span class="s0">degree of intimacy was chosen for the future.</span>
<a name="l6517"><span class="ln">6517 </span></a>
<a name="l6518"><span class="ln">6518 </span></a><span class="s0">She could think of nothing better:  and though there was something</span>
<a name="l6519"><span class="ln">6519 </span></a><span class="s0">in it which her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude,</span>
<a name="l6520"><span class="ln">6520 </span></a><span class="s0">merely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?</span>
<a name="l6521"><span class="ln">6521 </span></a>
<a name="l6522"><span class="ln">6522 </span></a>
<a name="l6523"><span class="ln">6523 </span></a>
<a name="l6524"><span class="ln">6524 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER V</span>
<a name="l6525"><span class="ln">6525 </span></a>
<a name="l6526"><span class="ln">6526 </span></a>
<a name="l6527"><span class="ln">6527 </span></a><span class="s0">Small heart had Harriet for visiting.  Only half an hour before her</span>
<a name="l6528"><span class="ln">6528 </span></a><span class="s0">friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led</span>
<a name="l6529"><span class="ln">6529 </span></a><span class="s0">her to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to</span>
<a name="l6530"><span class="ln">6530 </span></a><span class="s0">_The_ _Rev._ _Philip_ _Elton_, _White-Hart_, _Bath_, was to be seen under the</span>
<a name="l6531"><span class="ln">6531 </span></a><span class="s0">operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to</span>
<a name="l6532"><span class="ln">6532 </span></a><span class="s0">convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world,</span>
<a name="l6533"><span class="ln">6533 </span></a><span class="s0">excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank.</span>
<a name="l6534"><span class="ln">6534 </span></a>
<a name="l6535"><span class="ln">6535 </span></a><span class="s0">She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to</span>
<a name="l6536"><span class="ln">6536 </span></a><span class="s0">be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led</span>
<a name="l6537"><span class="ln">6537 </span></a><span class="s0">between espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every</span>
<a name="l6538"><span class="ln">6538 </span></a><span class="s0">thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before,</span>
<a name="l6539"><span class="ln">6539 </span></a><span class="s0">was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted,</span>
<a name="l6540"><span class="ln">6540 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity,</span>
<a name="l6541"><span class="ln">6541 </span></a><span class="s0">which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed</span>
<a name="l6542"><span class="ln">6542 </span></a><span class="s0">quarter of an hour.  She went on herself, to give that portion</span>
<a name="l6543"><span class="ln">6543 </span></a><span class="s0">of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.</span>
<a name="l6544"><span class="ln">6544 </span></a>
<a name="l6545"><span class="ln">6545 </span></a><span class="s0">The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;</span>
<a name="l6546"><span class="ln">6546 </span></a><span class="s0">and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay,</span>
<a name="l6547"><span class="ln">6547 </span></a><span class="s0">and unattended by any alarming young man.  She came solitarily</span>
<a name="l6548"><span class="ln">6548 </span></a><span class="s0">down the gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door,</span>
<a name="l6549"><span class="ln">6549 </span></a><span class="s0">and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility.</span>
<a name="l6550"><span class="ln">6550 </span></a>
<a name="l6551"><span class="ln">6551 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account.</span>
<a name="l6552"><span class="ln">6552 </span></a><span class="s0">She was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her</span>
<a name="l6553"><span class="ln">6553 </span></a><span class="s0">enough to understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it</span>
<a name="l6554"><span class="ln">6554 </span></a><span class="s0">was creating.  She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls.</span>
<a name="l6555"><span class="ln">6555 </span></a><span class="s0">They had received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing</span>
<a name="l6556"><span class="ln">6556 </span></a><span class="s0">beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time--</span>
<a name="l6557"><span class="ln">6557 </span></a><span class="s0">till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's saying, all of a sudden,</span>
<a name="l6558"><span class="ln">6558 </span></a><span class="s0">that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more</span>
<a name="l6559"><span class="ln">6559 </span></a><span class="s0">interesting subject, and a warmer manner.  In that very room</span>
<a name="l6560"><span class="ln">6560 </span></a><span class="s0">she had been measured last September, with her two friends.</span>
<a name="l6561"><span class="ln">6561 </span></a><span class="s0">There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by</span>
<a name="l6562"><span class="ln">6562 </span></a><span class="s0">the window.  _He_ had done it.  They all seemed to remember the day,</span>
<a name="l6563"><span class="ln">6563 </span></a><span class="s0">the hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness,</span>
<a name="l6564"><span class="ln">6564 </span></a><span class="s0">the same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding;</span>
<a name="l6565"><span class="ln">6565 </span></a><span class="s0">and they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma</span>
<a name="l6566"><span class="ln">6566 </span></a><span class="s0">must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,)</span>
<a name="l6567"><span class="ln">6567 </span></a><span class="s0">when the carriage reappeared, and all was over.  The style of</span>
<a name="l6568"><span class="ln">6568 </span></a><span class="s0">the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive.</span>
<a name="l6569"><span class="ln">6569 </span></a><span class="s0">Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully</span>
<a name="l6570"><span class="ln">6570 </span></a><span class="s0">passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture</span>
<a name="l6571"><span class="ln">6571 </span></a><span class="s0">it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally</span>
<a name="l6572"><span class="ln">6572 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet must suffer.  It was a bad business.  She would have given</span>
<a name="l6573"><span class="ln">6573 </span></a><span class="s0">a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins</span>
<a name="l6574"><span class="ln">6574 </span></a><span class="s0">in a higher rank of life.  They were so deserving, that a _little_</span>
<a name="l6575"><span class="ln">6575 </span></a><span class="s0">higher should have been enough:  but as it was, how could she have</span>
<a name="l6576"><span class="ln">6576 </span></a><span class="s0">done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent.  They must</span>
<a name="l6577"><span class="ln">6577 </span></a><span class="s0">be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--</span>
<a name="l6578"><span class="ln">6578 </span></a><span class="s0">so much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity</span>
<a name="l6579"><span class="ln">6579 </span></a><span class="s0">of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls</span>
<a name="l6580"><span class="ln">6580 </span></a><span class="s0">to procure it.  Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins.</span>
<a name="l6581"><span class="ln">6581 </span></a><span class="s0">The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.</span>
<a name="l6582"><span class="ln">6582 </span></a>
<a name="l6583"><span class="ln">6583 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard</span>
<a name="l6584"><span class="ln">6584 </span></a><span class="s0">that neither &quot;master nor mistress was at home;&quot; they had both</span>
<a name="l6585"><span class="ln">6585 </span></a><span class="s0">been out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l6586"><span class="ln">6586 </span></a>
<a name="l6587"><span class="ln">6587 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This is too bad,&quot; cried Emma, as they turned away.  &quot;And now we</span>
<a name="l6588"><span class="ln">6588 </span></a><span class="s0">shall just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been</span>
<a name="l6589"><span class="ln">6589 </span></a><span class="s0">so disappointed.&quot;  And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge</span>
<a name="l6590"><span class="ln">6590 </span></a><span class="s0">her murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--</span>
<a name="l6591"><span class="ln">6591 </span></a><span class="s0">such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind.</span>
<a name="l6592"><span class="ln">6592 </span></a><span class="s0">Presently the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt</span>
<a name="l6593"><span class="ln">6593 </span></a><span class="s0">by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her.</span>
<a name="l6594"><span class="ln">6594 </span></a><span class="s0">There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater</span>
<a name="l6595"><span class="ln">6595 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston immediately accosted</span>
<a name="l6596"><span class="ln">6596 </span></a><span class="s0">her with,</span>
<a name="l6597"><span class="ln">6597 </span></a>
<a name="l6598"><span class="ln">6598 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--</span>
<a name="l6599"><span class="ln">6599 </span></a><span class="s0">glad to see him so well.  Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter</span>
<a name="l6600"><span class="ln">6600 </span></a><span class="s0">this morning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--</span>
<a name="l6601"><span class="ln">6601 </span></a><span class="s0">he is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would</span>
<a name="l6602"><span class="ln">6602 </span></a><span class="s0">be so.  If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days;</span>
<a name="l6603"><span class="ln">6603 </span></a><span class="s0">I was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going</span>
<a name="l6604"><span class="ln">6604 </span></a><span class="s0">to have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather.</span>
<a name="l6605"><span class="ln">6605 </span></a><span class="s0">We shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly</span>
<a name="l6606"><span class="ln">6606 </span></a><span class="s0">as we could wish.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6607"><span class="ln">6607 </span></a>
<a name="l6608"><span class="ln">6608 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the</span>
<a name="l6609"><span class="ln">6609 </span></a><span class="s0">influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all</span>
<a name="l6610"><span class="ln">6610 </span></a><span class="s0">was by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter,</span>
<a name="l6611"><span class="ln">6611 </span></a><span class="s0">but not less to the purpose.  To know that _she_ thought his coming</span>
<a name="l6612"><span class="ln">6612 </span></a><span class="s0">certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did</span>
<a name="l6613"><span class="ln">6613 </span></a><span class="s0">she rejoice in their joy.  It was a most delightful reanimation</span>
<a name="l6614"><span class="ln">6614 </span></a><span class="s0">of exhausted spirits.  The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness</span>
<a name="l6615"><span class="ln">6615 </span></a><span class="s0">of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought,</span>
<a name="l6616"><span class="ln">6616 </span></a><span class="s0">she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.</span>
<a name="l6617"><span class="ln">6617 </span></a>
<a name="l6618"><span class="ln">6618 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,</span>
<a name="l6619"><span class="ln">6619 </span></a><span class="s0">which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at</span>
<a name="l6620"><span class="ln">6620 </span></a><span class="s0">his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey;</span>
<a name="l6621"><span class="ln">6621 </span></a><span class="s0">and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.</span>
<a name="l6622"><span class="ln">6622 </span></a>
<a name="l6623"><span class="ln">6623 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,&quot; said he, at the conclusion.</span>
<a name="l6624"><span class="ln">6624 </span></a>
<a name="l6625"><span class="ln">6625 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech,</span>
<a name="l6626"><span class="ln">6626 </span></a><span class="s0">from his wife.</span>
<a name="l6627"><span class="ln">6627 </span></a>
<a name="l6628"><span class="ln">6628 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We had better move on, Mr. Weston,&quot; said she, &quot;we are detaining</span>
<a name="l6629"><span class="ln">6629 </span></a><span class="s0">the girls.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6630"><span class="ln">6630 </span></a>
<a name="l6631"><span class="ln">6631 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, well, I am ready;&quot;--and turning again to Emma, &quot;but you must</span>
<a name="l6632"><span class="ln">6632 </span></a><span class="s0">not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_</span>
<a name="l6633"><span class="ln">6633 </span></a><span class="s0">account you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:&quot;--</span>
<a name="l6634"><span class="ln">6634 </span></a><span class="s0">though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very</span>
<a name="l6635"><span class="ln">6635 </span></a><span class="s0">different conviction.</span>
<a name="l6636"><span class="ln">6636 </span></a>
<a name="l6637"><span class="ln">6637 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer</span>
<a name="l6638"><span class="ln">6638 </span></a><span class="s0">in a manner that appropriated nothing.</span>
<a name="l6639"><span class="ln">6639 </span></a>
<a name="l6640"><span class="ln">6640 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,&quot;</span>
<a name="l6641"><span class="ln">6641 </span></a><span class="s0">was Mrs. Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety,</span>
<a name="l6642"><span class="ln">6642 </span></a><span class="s0">and meant only for her.</span>
<a name="l6643"><span class="ln">6643 </span></a>
<a name="l6644"><span class="ln">6644 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,&quot; was Mr. Weston's</span>
<a name="l6645"><span class="ln">6645 </span></a><span class="s0">quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.</span>
<a name="l6646"><span class="ln">6646 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore</span>
<a name="l6647"><span class="ln">6647 </span></a><span class="s0">a different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish</span>
<a name="l6648"><span class="ln">6648 </span></a><span class="s0">as before.  When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at</span>
<a name="l6649"><span class="ln">6649 </span></a><span class="s0">least must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet,</span>
<a name="l6650"><span class="ln">6650 </span></a><span class="s0">she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.</span>
<a name="l6651"><span class="ln">6651 </span></a>
<a name="l6652"><span class="ln">6652 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?&quot;--</span>
<a name="l6653"><span class="ln">6653 </span></a><span class="s0">was a question, however, which did not augur much.</span>
<a name="l6654"><span class="ln">6654 </span></a>
<a name="l6655"><span class="ln">6655 </span></a><span class="s0">But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once,</span>
<a name="l6656"><span class="ln">6656 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come</span>
<a name="l6657"><span class="ln">6657 </span></a><span class="s0">in time.</span>
<a name="l6658"><span class="ln">6658 </span></a>
<a name="l6659"><span class="ln">6659 </span></a><span class="s0">The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's</span>
<a name="l6660"><span class="ln">6660 </span></a><span class="s0">faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve</span>
<a name="l6661"><span class="ln">6661 </span></a><span class="s0">o'clock, that she was to think of her at four.</span>
<a name="l6662"><span class="ln">6662 </span></a>
<a name="l6663"><span class="ln">6663 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear, dear anxious friend,&quot;--said she, in mental soliloquy,</span>
<a name="l6664"><span class="ln">6664 </span></a><span class="s0">while walking downstairs from her own room, &quot;always overcareful</span>
<a name="l6665"><span class="ln">6665 </span></a><span class="s0">for every body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your</span>
<a name="l6666"><span class="ln">6666 </span></a><span class="s0">little fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure</span>
<a name="l6667"><span class="ln">6667 </span></a><span class="s0">that all is right.&quot;  The clock struck twelve as she passed through</span>
<a name="l6668"><span class="ln">6668 </span></a><span class="s0">the hall.  &quot;'Tis twelve; I shall not forget to think of you four</span>
<a name="l6669"><span class="ln">6669 </span></a><span class="s0">hours hence; and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later,</span>
<a name="l6670"><span class="ln">6670 </span></a><span class="s0">I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here.</span>
<a name="l6671"><span class="ln">6671 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure they will bring him soon.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6672"><span class="ln">6672 </span></a>
<a name="l6673"><span class="ln">6673 </span></a><span class="s0">She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with</span>
<a name="l6674"><span class="ln">6674 </span></a><span class="s0">her father--Mr. Weston and his son.  They had been arrived only</span>
<a name="l6675"><span class="ln">6675 </span></a><span class="s0">a few minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation</span>
<a name="l6676"><span class="ln">6676 </span></a><span class="s0">of Frank's being a day before his time, and her father was yet</span>
<a name="l6677"><span class="ln">6677 </span></a><span class="s0">in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when</span>
<a name="l6678"><span class="ln">6678 </span></a><span class="s0">she appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.</span>
<a name="l6679"><span class="ln">6679 </span></a>
<a name="l6680"><span class="ln">6680 </span></a><span class="s0">The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest,</span>
<a name="l6681"><span class="ln">6681 </span></a><span class="s0">was actually before her--he was presented to her, and she did</span>
<a name="l6682"><span class="ln">6682 </span></a><span class="s0">not think too much had been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good</span>
<a name="l6683"><span class="ln">6683 </span></a><span class="s0">looking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable,</span>
<a name="l6684"><span class="ln">6684 </span></a><span class="s0">and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness</span>
<a name="l6685"><span class="ln">6685 </span></a><span class="s0">of his father's; he looked quick and sensible.  She felt immediately</span>
<a name="l6686"><span class="ln">6686 </span></a><span class="s0">that she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner,</span>
<a name="l6687"><span class="ln">6687 </span></a><span class="s0">and a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending</span>
<a name="l6688"><span class="ln">6688 </span></a><span class="s0">to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.</span>
<a name="l6689"><span class="ln">6689 </span></a>
<a name="l6690"><span class="ln">6690 </span></a><span class="s0">He had reached Randalls the evening before.  She was pleased</span>
<a name="l6691"><span class="ln">6691 </span></a><span class="s0">with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan,</span>
<a name="l6692"><span class="ln">6692 </span></a><span class="s0">and travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half</span>
<a name="l6693"><span class="ln">6693 </span></a><span class="s0">a day.</span>
<a name="l6694"><span class="ln">6694 </span></a>
<a name="l6695"><span class="ln">6695 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I told you yesterday,&quot; cried Mr. Weston with exultation, &quot;I told</span>
<a name="l6696"><span class="ln">6696 </span></a><span class="s0">you all that he would be here before the time named.  I remembered</span>
<a name="l6697"><span class="ln">6697 </span></a><span class="s0">what I used to do myself.  One cannot creep upon a journey;</span>
<a name="l6698"><span class="ln">6698 </span></a><span class="s0">one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the</span>
<a name="l6699"><span class="ln">6699 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins,</span>
<a name="l6700"><span class="ln">6700 </span></a><span class="s0">is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6701"><span class="ln">6701 </span></a>
<a name="l6702"><span class="ln">6702 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,&quot; said the young man,</span>
<a name="l6703"><span class="ln">6703 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;</span>
<a name="l6704"><span class="ln">6704 </span></a><span class="s0">but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6705"><span class="ln">6705 </span></a>
<a name="l6706"><span class="ln">6706 </span></a><span class="s0">The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.</span>
<a name="l6707"><span class="ln">6707 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable;</span>
<a name="l6708"><span class="ln">6708 </span></a><span class="s0">the conviction was strengthened by what followed.  He was very much</span>
<a name="l6709"><span class="ln">6709 </span></a><span class="s0">pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house,</span>
<a name="l6710"><span class="ln">6710 </span></a><span class="s0">would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation,</span>
<a name="l6711"><span class="ln">6711 </span></a><span class="s0">the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more,</span>
<a name="l6712"><span class="ln">6712 </span></a><span class="s0">and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest</span>
<a name="l6713"><span class="ln">6713 </span></a><span class="s0">in the country which none but one's _own_ country gives, and the</span>
<a name="l6714"><span class="ln">6714 </span></a><span class="s0">greatest curiosity to visit it.  That he should never have been</span>
<a name="l6715"><span class="ln">6715 </span></a><span class="s0">able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously</span>
<a name="l6716"><span class="ln">6716 </span></a><span class="s0">through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a</span>
<a name="l6717"><span class="ln">6717 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasant one, and pleasantly handled.  His manner had no air of study</span>
<a name="l6718"><span class="ln">6718 </span></a><span class="s0">or exaggeration.  He did really look and speak as if in a state of no</span>
<a name="l6719"><span class="ln">6719 </span></a><span class="s0">common enjoyment.</span>
<a name="l6720"><span class="ln">6720 </span></a>
<a name="l6721"><span class="ln">6721 </span></a><span class="s0">Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance.</span>
<a name="l6722"><span class="ln">6722 </span></a><span class="s0">On his side were the inquiries,--&quot;Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--</span>
<a name="l6723"><span class="ln">6723 </span></a><span class="s0">Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps,</span>
<a name="l6724"><span class="ln">6724 </span></a><span class="s0">afforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses</span>
<a name="l6725"><span class="ln">6725 </span></a><span class="s0">in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was it a musical society?&quot;</span>
<a name="l6726"><span class="ln">6726 </span></a>
<a name="l6727"><span class="ln">6727 </span></a><span class="s0">But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance</span>
<a name="l6728"><span class="ln">6728 </span></a><span class="s0">proportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity,</span>
<a name="l6729"><span class="ln">6729 </span></a><span class="s0">while their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing</span>
<a name="l6730"><span class="ln">6730 </span></a><span class="s0">his mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise,</span>
<a name="l6731"><span class="ln">6731 </span></a><span class="s0">so much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she</span>
<a name="l6732"><span class="ln">6732 </span></a><span class="s0">secured to his father, and her very kind reception of himself,</span>
<a name="l6733"><span class="ln">6733 </span></a><span class="s0">as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please--</span>
<a name="l6734"><span class="ln">6734 </span></a><span class="s0">and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her.</span>
<a name="l6735"><span class="ln">6735 </span></a><span class="s0">He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be</span>
<a name="l6736"><span class="ln">6736 </span></a><span class="s0">thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know</span>
<a name="l6737"><span class="ln">6737 </span></a><span class="s0">very little of the matter.  He understood what would be welcome;</span>
<a name="l6738"><span class="ln">6738 </span></a><span class="s0">he could be sure of little else.  &quot;His father's marriage,&quot; he said,</span>
<a name="l6739"><span class="ln">6739 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it;</span>
<a name="l6740"><span class="ln">6740 </span></a><span class="s0">and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must</span>
<a name="l6741"><span class="ln">6741 </span></a><span class="s0">be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation</span>
<a name="l6742"><span class="ln">6742 </span></a><span class="s0">on him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6743"><span class="ln">6743 </span></a>
<a name="l6744"><span class="ln">6744 </span></a><span class="s0">He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,</span>
<a name="l6745"><span class="ln">6745 </span></a><span class="s0">without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it</span>
<a name="l6746"><span class="ln">6746 </span></a><span class="s0">was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's</span>
<a name="l6747"><span class="ln">6747 </span></a><span class="s0">character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if resolved</span>
<a name="l6748"><span class="ln">6748 </span></a><span class="s0">to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he</span>
<a name="l6749"><span class="ln">6749 </span></a><span class="s0">wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.</span>
<a name="l6750"><span class="ln">6750 </span></a>
<a name="l6751"><span class="ln">6751 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,&quot; said he;</span>
<a name="l6752"><span class="ln">6752 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected</span>
<a name="l6753"><span class="ln">6753 </span></a><span class="s0">more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age;</span>
<a name="l6754"><span class="ln">6754 </span></a><span class="s0">I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6755"><span class="ln">6755 </span></a>
<a name="l6756"><span class="ln">6756 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,&quot;</span>
<a name="l6757"><span class="ln">6757 </span></a><span class="s0">said Emma; &quot;were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen</span>
<a name="l6758"><span class="ln">6758 </span></a><span class="s0">with pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using</span>
<a name="l6759"><span class="ln">6759 </span></a><span class="s0">such words.  Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as</span>
<a name="l6760"><span class="ln">6760 </span></a><span class="s0">a pretty young woman.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6761"><span class="ln">6761 </span></a>
<a name="l6762"><span class="ln">6762 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope I should know better,&quot; he replied; &quot;no, depend upon it,</span>
<a name="l6763"><span class="ln">6763 </span></a><span class="s0">(with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should</span>
<a name="l6764"><span class="ln">6764 </span></a><span class="s0">understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought</span>
<a name="l6765"><span class="ln">6765 </span></a><span class="s0">extravagant in my terms.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6766"><span class="ln">6766 </span></a>
<a name="l6767"><span class="ln">6767 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected</span>
<a name="l6768"><span class="ln">6768 </span></a><span class="s0">from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession</span>
<a name="l6769"><span class="ln">6769 </span></a><span class="s0">of her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were</span>
<a name="l6770"><span class="ln">6770 </span></a><span class="s0">to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance.</span>
<a name="l6771"><span class="ln">6771 </span></a><span class="s0">She must see more of him to understand his ways; at present she</span>
<a name="l6772"><span class="ln">6772 </span></a><span class="s0">only felt they were agreeable.</span>
<a name="l6773"><span class="ln">6773 </span></a>
<a name="l6774"><span class="ln">6774 </span></a><span class="s0">She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about.</span>
<a name="l6775"><span class="ln">6775 </span></a><span class="s0">His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them</span>
<a name="l6776"><span class="ln">6776 </span></a><span class="s0">with a happy expression; and even, when he might have determined not</span>
<a name="l6777"><span class="ln">6777 </span></a><span class="s0">to look, she was confident that he was often listening.</span>
<a name="l6778"><span class="ln">6778 </span></a>
<a name="l6779"><span class="ln">6779 </span></a><span class="s0">Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind,</span>
<a name="l6780"><span class="ln">6780 </span></a><span class="s0">the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration</span>
<a name="l6781"><span class="ln">6781 </span></a><span class="s0">or suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance.  Happily he</span>
<a name="l6782"><span class="ln">6782 </span></a><span class="s0">was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--</span>
<a name="l6783"><span class="ln">6783 </span></a><span class="s0">Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged,</span>
<a name="l6784"><span class="ln">6784 </span></a><span class="s0">he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any;</span>
<a name="l6785"><span class="ln">6785 </span></a><span class="s0">it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons'</span>
<a name="l6786"><span class="ln">6786 </span></a><span class="s0">understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were</span>
<a name="l6787"><span class="ln">6787 </span></a><span class="s0">proved against them.  She blessed the favouring blindness.</span>
<a name="l6788"><span class="ln">6788 </span></a><span class="s0">He could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise,</span>
<a name="l6789"><span class="ln">6789 </span></a><span class="s0">without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest,</span>
<a name="l6790"><span class="ln">6790 </span></a><span class="s0">give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous</span>
<a name="l6791"><span class="ln">6791 </span></a><span class="s0">inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey,</span>
<a name="l6792"><span class="ln">6792 </span></a><span class="s0">through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express</span>
<a name="l6793"><span class="ln">6793 </span></a><span class="s0">very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped</span>
<a name="l6794"><span class="ln">6794 </span></a><span class="s0">catching cold--which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite</span>
<a name="l6795"><span class="ln">6795 </span></a><span class="s0">assured of himself till after another night.</span>
<a name="l6796"><span class="ln">6796 </span></a>
<a name="l6797"><span class="ln">6797 </span></a><span class="s0">A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--&quot;He must be going.</span>
<a name="l6798"><span class="ln">6798 </span></a><span class="s0">He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands</span>
<a name="l6799"><span class="ln">6799 </span></a><span class="s0">for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6800"><span class="ln">6800 </span></a><span class="s0">His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,</span>
<a name="l6801"><span class="ln">6801 </span></a><span class="s0">saying,</span>
<a name="l6802"><span class="ln">6802 </span></a>
<a name="l6803"><span class="ln">6803 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the</span>
<a name="l6804"><span class="ln">6804 </span></a><span class="s0">opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other,</span>
<a name="l6805"><span class="ln">6805 </span></a><span class="s0">and therefore may as well be paid now.  I have the honour of being</span>
<a name="l6806"><span class="ln">6806 </span></a><span class="s0">acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady</span>
<a name="l6807"><span class="ln">6807 </span></a><span class="s0">residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.</span>
<a name="l6808"><span class="ln">6808 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house;</span>
<a name="l6809"><span class="ln">6809 </span></a><span class="s0">though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name--I should rather</span>
<a name="l6810"><span class="ln">6810 </span></a><span class="s0">say Barnes, or Bates.  Do you know any family of that name?&quot;</span>
<a name="l6811"><span class="ln">6811 </span></a>
<a name="l6812"><span class="ln">6812 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To be sure we do,&quot; cried his father; &quot;Mrs. Bates--we passed her house--</span>
<a name="l6813"><span class="ln">6813 </span></a><span class="s0">I saw Miss Bates at the window.  True, true, you are acquainted</span>
<a name="l6814"><span class="ln">6814 </span></a><span class="s0">with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine</span>
<a name="l6815"><span class="ln">6815 </span></a><span class="s0">girl she is.  Call upon her, by all means.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6816"><span class="ln">6816 </span></a>
<a name="l6817"><span class="ln">6817 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There is no necessity for my calling this morning,&quot; said the</span>
<a name="l6818"><span class="ln">6818 </span></a><span class="s0">young man; &quot;another day would do as well; but there was that degree</span>
<a name="l6819"><span class="ln">6819 </span></a><span class="s0">of acquaintance at Weymouth which--&quot;</span>
<a name="l6820"><span class="ln">6820 </span></a>
<a name="l6821"><span class="ln">6821 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it.  What is right to be done</span>
<a name="l6822"><span class="ln">6822 </span></a><span class="s0">cannot be done too soon.  And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;</span>
<a name="l6823"><span class="ln">6823 </span></a><span class="s0">any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided.</span>
<a name="l6824"><span class="ln">6824 </span></a><span class="s0">You saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body</span>
<a name="l6825"><span class="ln">6825 </span></a><span class="s0">she mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother,</span>
<a name="l6826"><span class="ln">6826 </span></a><span class="s0">who has barely enough to live on.  If you do not call early it</span>
<a name="l6827"><span class="ln">6827 </span></a><span class="s0">will be a slight.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6828"><span class="ln">6828 </span></a>
<a name="l6829"><span class="ln">6829 </span></a><span class="s0">The son looked convinced.</span>
<a name="l6830"><span class="ln">6830 </span></a>
<a name="l6831"><span class="ln">6831 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,&quot; said Emma; &quot;she is</span>
<a name="l6832"><span class="ln">6832 </span></a><span class="s0">a very elegant young woman.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6833"><span class="ln">6833 </span></a>
<a name="l6834"><span class="ln">6834 </span></a><span class="s0">He agreed to it, but with so quiet a &quot;Yes,&quot; as inclined her almost</span>
<a name="l6835"><span class="ln">6835 </span></a><span class="s0">to doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct</span>
<a name="l6836"><span class="ln">6836 </span></a><span class="s0">sort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could</span>
<a name="l6837"><span class="ln">6837 </span></a><span class="s0">be thought only ordinarily gifted with it.</span>
<a name="l6838"><span class="ln">6838 </span></a>
<a name="l6839"><span class="ln">6839 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,&quot;</span>
<a name="l6840"><span class="ln">6840 </span></a><span class="s0">said she, &quot;I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage;</span>
<a name="l6841"><span class="ln">6841 </span></a><span class="s0">see her and hear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all,</span>
<a name="l6842"><span class="ln">6842 </span></a><span class="s0">for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6843"><span class="ln">6843 </span></a>
<a name="l6844"><span class="ln">6844 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?&quot;</span>
<a name="l6845"><span class="ln">6845 </span></a><span class="s0">said Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation;</span>
<a name="l6846"><span class="ln">6846 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very</span>
<a name="l6847"><span class="ln">6847 </span></a><span class="s0">agreeable young lady.  She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama</span>
<a name="l6848"><span class="ln">6848 </span></a><span class="s0">and aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life.</span>
<a name="l6849"><span class="ln">6849 </span></a><span class="s0">They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my</span>
<a name="l6850"><span class="ln">6850 </span></a><span class="s0">servants shall go with you to shew you the way.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6851"><span class="ln">6851 </span></a>
<a name="l6852"><span class="ln">6852 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6853"><span class="ln">6853 </span></a>
<a name="l6854"><span class="ln">6854 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,</span>
<a name="l6855"><span class="ln">6855 </span></a><span class="s0">quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses;</span>
<a name="l6856"><span class="ln">6856 </span></a><span class="s0">you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,</span>
<a name="l6857"><span class="ln">6857 </span></a><span class="s0">unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you</span>
<a name="l6858"><span class="ln">6858 </span></a><span class="s0">where you had best cross the street.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6859"><span class="ln">6859 </span></a>
<a name="l6860"><span class="ln">6860 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,</span>
<a name="l6861"><span class="ln">6861 </span></a><span class="s0">and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, &quot;My good friend,</span>
<a name="l6862"><span class="ln">6862 </span></a><span class="s0">this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he</span>
<a name="l6863"><span class="ln">6863 </span></a><span class="s0">sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown</span>
<a name="l6864"><span class="ln">6864 </span></a><span class="s0">in a hop, step, and jump.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6865"><span class="ln">6865 </span></a>
<a name="l6866"><span class="ln">6866 </span></a><span class="s0">They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one,</span>
<a name="l6867"><span class="ln">6867 </span></a><span class="s0">and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave.</span>
<a name="l6868"><span class="ln">6868 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance,</span>
<a name="l6869"><span class="ln">6869 </span></a><span class="s0">and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of</span>
<a name="l6870"><span class="ln">6870 </span></a><span class="s0">the day, with full confidence in their comfort.</span>
<a name="l6871"><span class="ln">6871 </span></a>
<a name="l6872"><span class="ln">6872 </span></a>
<a name="l6873"><span class="ln">6873 </span></a>
<a name="l6874"><span class="ln">6874 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER VI</span>
<a name="l6875"><span class="ln">6875 </span></a>
<a name="l6876"><span class="ln">6876 </span></a>
<a name="l6877"><span class="ln">6877 </span></a><span class="s0">The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again.  He came with</span>
<a name="l6878"><span class="ln">6878 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially.</span>
<a name="l6879"><span class="ln">6879 </span></a><span class="s0">He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,</span>
<a name="l6880"><span class="ln">6880 </span></a><span class="s0">till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse</span>
<a name="l6881"><span class="ln">6881 </span></a><span class="s0">their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--&quot;He did not doubt there</span>
<a name="l6882"><span class="ln">6882 </span></a><span class="s0">being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him,</span>
<a name="l6883"><span class="ln">6883 </span></a><span class="s0">he should always chuse the same.  Highbury, that airy, cheerful,</span>
<a name="l6884"><span class="ln">6884 </span></a><span class="s0">happy-looking Highbury, would be his constant attraction.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l6885"><span class="ln">6885 </span></a><span class="s0">Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted to</span>
<a name="l6886"><span class="ln">6886 </span></a><span class="s0">its bearing the same construction with him.  They walked thither directly.</span>
<a name="l6887"><span class="ln">6887 </span></a>
<a name="l6888"><span class="ln">6888 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had hardly expected them:  for Mr. Weston, who had called in</span>
<a name="l6889"><span class="ln">6889 </span></a><span class="s0">for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome,</span>
<a name="l6890"><span class="ln">6890 </span></a><span class="s0">knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize</span>
<a name="l6891"><span class="ln">6891 </span></a><span class="s0">to her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together,</span>
<a name="l6892"><span class="ln">6892 </span></a><span class="s0">arm in arm.  She was wanting to see him again, and especially</span>
<a name="l6893"><span class="ln">6893 </span></a><span class="s0">to see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom</span>
<a name="l6894"><span class="ln">6894 </span></a><span class="s0">her opinion of him was to depend.  If he were deficient there,</span>
<a name="l6895"><span class="ln">6895 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing should make amends for it.  But on seeing them together,</span>
<a name="l6896"><span class="ln">6896 </span></a><span class="s0">she became perfectly satisfied.  It was not merely in fine words</span>
<a name="l6897"><span class="ln">6897 </span></a><span class="s0">or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be</span>
<a name="l6898"><span class="ln">6898 </span></a><span class="s0">more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her--nothing could</span>
<a name="l6899"><span class="ln">6899 </span></a><span class="s0">more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and</span>
<a name="l6900"><span class="ln">6900 </span></a><span class="s0">securing her affection.  And there was time enough for Emma to form a</span>
<a name="l6901"><span class="ln">6901 </span></a><span class="s0">reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning.</span>
<a name="l6902"><span class="ln">6902 </span></a><span class="s0">They were all three walking about together for an hour or two--</span>
<a name="l6903"><span class="ln">6903 </span></a><span class="s0">first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.</span>
<a name="l6904"><span class="ln">6904 </span></a><span class="s0">He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently</span>
<a name="l6905"><span class="ln">6905 </span></a><span class="s0">for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on,</span>
<a name="l6906"><span class="ln">6906 </span></a><span class="s0">confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village,</span>
<a name="l6907"><span class="ln">6907 </span></a><span class="s0">and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma</span>
<a name="l6908"><span class="ln">6908 </span></a><span class="s0">could have supposed.</span>
<a name="l6909"><span class="ln">6909 </span></a>
<a name="l6910"><span class="ln">6910 </span></a><span class="s0">Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings.</span>
<a name="l6911"><span class="ln">6911 </span></a><span class="s0">He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long,</span>
<a name="l6912"><span class="ln">6912 </span></a><span class="s0">and which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting</span>
<a name="l6913"><span class="ln">6913 </span></a><span class="s0">that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest</span>
<a name="l6914"><span class="ln">6914 </span></a><span class="s0">of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though</span>
<a name="l6915"><span class="ln">6915 </span></a><span class="s0">in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit,</span>
<a name="l6916"><span class="ln">6916 </span></a><span class="s0">they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general,</span>
<a name="l6917"><span class="ln">6917 </span></a><span class="s0">which must be very like a merit to those he was with.</span>
<a name="l6918"><span class="ln">6918 </span></a>
<a name="l6919"><span class="ln">6919 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn,</span>
<a name="l6920"><span class="ln">6920 </span></a><span class="s0">it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily</span>
<a name="l6921"><span class="ln">6921 </span></a><span class="s0">absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making</span>
<a name="l6922"><span class="ln">6922 </span></a><span class="s0">a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly</span>
<a name="l6923"><span class="ln">6923 </span></a><span class="s0">had not done him justice.</span>
<a name="l6924"><span class="ln">6924 </span></a>
<a name="l6925"><span class="ln">6925 </span></a><span class="s0">Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house,</span>
<a name="l6926"><span class="ln">6926 </span></a><span class="s0">though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of</span>
<a name="l6927"><span class="ln">6927 </span></a><span class="s0">post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood</span>
<a name="l6928"><span class="ln">6928 </span></a><span class="s0">than from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected</span>
<a name="l6929"><span class="ln">6929 </span></a><span class="s0">to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they</span>
<a name="l6930"><span class="ln">6930 </span></a><span class="s0">gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built</span>
<a name="l6931"><span class="ln">6931 </span></a><span class="s0">many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been</span>
<a name="l6932"><span class="ln">6932 </span></a><span class="s0">in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used</span>
<a name="l6933"><span class="ln">6933 </span></a><span class="s0">as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the</span>
<a name="l6934"><span class="ln">6934 </span></a><span class="s0">highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist</span>
<a name="l6935"><span class="ln">6935 </span></a><span class="s0">club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.</span>
<a name="l6936"><span class="ln">6936 </span></a><span class="s0">He was immediately interested.  Its character as a ball-room caught him;</span>
<a name="l6937"><span class="ln">6937 </span></a><span class="s0">and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two</span>
<a name="l6938"><span class="ln">6938 </span></a><span class="s0">superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate</span>
<a name="l6939"><span class="ln">6939 </span></a><span class="s0">its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should</span>
<a name="l6940"><span class="ln">6940 </span></a><span class="s0">have ceased.  He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge</span>
<a name="l6941"><span class="ln">6941 </span></a><span class="s0">none which they suggested.  No, it was long enough, broad enough,</span>
<a name="l6942"><span class="ln">6942 </span></a><span class="s0">handsome enough.  It would hold the very number for comfort.</span>
<a name="l6943"><span class="ln">6943 </span></a><span class="s0">They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through</span>
<a name="l6944"><span class="ln">6944 </span></a><span class="s0">the winter.  Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good</span>
<a name="l6945"><span class="ln">6945 </span></a><span class="s0">old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury!</span>
<a name="l6946"><span class="ln">6946 </span></a><span class="s0">The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction</span>
<a name="l6947"><span class="ln">6947 </span></a><span class="s0">that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be</span>
<a name="l6948"><span class="ln">6948 </span></a><span class="s0">tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied.</span>
<a name="l6949"><span class="ln">6949 </span></a><span class="s0">He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw</span>
<a name="l6950"><span class="ln">6950 </span></a><span class="s0">around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting;</span>
<a name="l6951"><span class="ln">6951 </span></a><span class="s0">and even when particulars were given and families described, he was</span>
<a name="l6952"><span class="ln">6952 </span></a><span class="s0">still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture</span>
<a name="l6953"><span class="ln">6953 </span></a><span class="s0">would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty</span>
<a name="l6954"><span class="ln">6954 </span></a><span class="s0">in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning.</span>
<a name="l6955"><span class="ln">6955 </span></a><span class="s0">He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma</span>
<a name="l6956"><span class="ln">6956 </span></a><span class="s0">was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail</span>
<a name="l6957"><span class="ln">6957 </span></a><span class="s0">so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.  He seemed to have</span>
<a name="l6958"><span class="ln">6958 </span></a><span class="s0">all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations</span>
<a name="l6959"><span class="ln">6959 </span></a><span class="s0">of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe.</span>
<a name="l6960"><span class="ln">6960 </span></a><span class="s0">Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference</span>
<a name="l6961"><span class="ln">6961 </span></a><span class="s0">to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.</span>
<a name="l6962"><span class="ln">6962 </span></a><span class="s0">He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.</span>
<a name="l6963"><span class="ln">6963 </span></a><span class="s0">It was but an effusion of lively spirits.</span>
<a name="l6964"><span class="ln">6964 </span></a>
<a name="l6965"><span class="ln">6965 </span></a><span class="s0">At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;</span>
<a name="l6966"><span class="ln">6966 </span></a><span class="s0">and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged,</span>
<a name="l6967"><span class="ln">6967 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him</span>
<a name="l6968"><span class="ln">6968 </span></a><span class="s0">if he had paid it.</span>
<a name="l6969"><span class="ln">6969 </span></a>
<a name="l6970"><span class="ln">6970 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, oh! yes&quot;--he replied; &quot;I was just going to mention it.</span>
<a name="l6971"><span class="ln">6971 </span></a><span class="s0">A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very</span>
<a name="l6972"><span class="ln">6972 </span></a><span class="s0">much obliged to you for your preparatory hint.  If the talking aunt</span>
<a name="l6973"><span class="ln">6973 </span></a><span class="s0">had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me.</span>
<a name="l6974"><span class="ln">6974 </span></a><span class="s0">As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit.</span>
<a name="l6975"><span class="ln">6975 </span></a><span class="s0">Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that</span>
<a name="l6976"><span class="ln">6976 </span></a><span class="s0">was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home</span>
<a name="l6977"><span class="ln">6977 </span></a><span class="s0">before him--but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my</span>
<a name="l6978"><span class="ln">6978 </span></a><span class="s0">utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else)</span>
<a name="l6979"><span class="ln">6979 </span></a><span class="s0">joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them</span>
<a name="l6980"><span class="ln">6980 </span></a><span class="s0">very nearly three-quarters of an hour.  The good lady had not given me</span>
<a name="l6981"><span class="ln">6981 </span></a><span class="s0">the possibility of escape before.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6982"><span class="ln">6982 </span></a>
<a name="l6983"><span class="ln">6983 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?&quot;</span>
<a name="l6984"><span class="ln">6984 </span></a>
<a name="l6985"><span class="ln">6985 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill.</span>
<a name="l6986"><span class="ln">6986 </span></a><span class="s0">But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?</span>
<a name="l6987"><span class="ln">6987 </span></a><span class="s0">Ladies can never look ill.  And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally</span>
<a name="l6988"><span class="ln">6988 </span></a><span class="s0">so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--</span>
<a name="l6989"><span class="ln">6989 </span></a><span class="s0">A most deplorable want of complexion.&quot;</span>
<a name="l6990"><span class="ln">6990 </span></a>
<a name="l6991"><span class="ln">6991 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss</span>
<a name="l6992"><span class="ln">6992 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax's complexion.  &quot;It was certainly never brilliant, but she</span>
<a name="l6993"><span class="ln">6993 </span></a><span class="s0">would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was</span>
<a name="l6994"><span class="ln">6994 </span></a><span class="s0">a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance</span>
<a name="l6995"><span class="ln">6995 </span></a><span class="s0">to the character of her face.&quot;  He listened with all due deference;</span>
<a name="l6996"><span class="ln">6996 </span></a><span class="s0">acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same--but yet he</span>
<a name="l6997"><span class="ln">6997 </span></a><span class="s0">must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want</span>
<a name="l6998"><span class="ln">6998 </span></a><span class="s0">of the fine glow of health.  Where features were indifferent,</span>
<a name="l6999"><span class="ln">6999 </span></a><span class="s0">a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good,</span>
<a name="l7000"><span class="ln">7000 </span></a><span class="s0">the effect was--fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the</span>
<a name="l7001"><span class="ln">7001 </span></a><span class="s0">effect was.</span>
<a name="l7002"><span class="ln">7002 </span></a>
<a name="l7003"><span class="ln">7003 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said Emma, &quot;there is no disputing about taste.--At least</span>
<a name="l7004"><span class="ln">7004 </span></a><span class="s0">you admire her except her complexion.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7005"><span class="ln">7005 </span></a>
<a name="l7006"><span class="ln">7006 </span></a><span class="s0">He shook his head and laughed.--&quot;I cannot separate Miss Fairfax</span>
<a name="l7007"><span class="ln">7007 </span></a><span class="s0">and her complexion.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7008"><span class="ln">7008 </span></a>
<a name="l7009"><span class="ln">7009 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Did you see her often at Weymouth?  Were you often in the same society?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7010"><span class="ln">7010 </span></a>
<a name="l7011"><span class="ln">7011 </span></a><span class="s0">At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,</span>
<a name="l7012"><span class="ln">7012 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day</span>
<a name="l7013"><span class="ln">7013 </span></a><span class="s0">of their lives, as my father informs me.  He comes to Highbury himself,</span>
<a name="l7014"><span class="ln">7014 </span></a><span class="s0">he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.</span>
<a name="l7015"><span class="ln">7015 </span></a><span class="s0">If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove</span>
<a name="l7016"><span class="ln">7016 </span></a><span class="s0">myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury.</span>
<a name="l7017"><span class="ln">7017 </span></a><span class="s0">I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--</span>
<a name="l7018"><span class="ln">7018 </span></a><span class="s0">I dare say they sell gloves.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7019"><span class="ln">7019 </span></a>
<a name="l7020"><span class="ln">7020 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes, gloves and every thing.  I do admire your patriotism.</span>
<a name="l7021"><span class="ln">7021 </span></a><span class="s0">You will be adored in Highbury.  You were very popular before you came,</span>
<a name="l7022"><span class="ln">7022 </span></a><span class="s0">because you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at</span>
<a name="l7023"><span class="ln">7023 </span></a><span class="s0">Ford's, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7024"><span class="ln">7024 </span></a>
<a name="l7025"><span class="ln">7025 </span></a><span class="s0">They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of &quot;Men's Beavers&quot;</span>
<a name="l7026"><span class="ln">7026 </span></a><span class="s0">and &quot;York Tan&quot; were bringing down and displaying on the counter,</span>
<a name="l7027"><span class="ln">7027 </span></a><span class="s0">he said--&quot;But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking</span>
<a name="l7028"><span class="ln">7028 </span></a><span class="s0">to me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst</span>
<a name="l7029"><span class="ln">7029 </span></a><span class="s0">of my _amor_ _patriae_.  Do not let me lose it.  I assure you the utmost</span>
<a name="l7030"><span class="ln">7030 </span></a><span class="s0">stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any</span>
<a name="l7031"><span class="ln">7031 </span></a><span class="s0">happiness in private life.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7032"><span class="ln">7032 </span></a>
<a name="l7033"><span class="ln">7033 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax</span>
<a name="l7034"><span class="ln">7034 </span></a><span class="s0">and her party at Weymouth.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7035"><span class="ln">7035 </span></a>
<a name="l7036"><span class="ln">7036 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a</span>
<a name="l7037"><span class="ln">7037 </span></a><span class="s0">very unfair one.  It is always the lady's right to decide on the degree</span>
<a name="l7038"><span class="ln">7038 </span></a><span class="s0">of acquaintance.  Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--</span>
<a name="l7039"><span class="ln">7039 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7040"><span class="ln">7040 </span></a>
<a name="l7041"><span class="ln">7041 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself.</span>
<a name="l7042"><span class="ln">7042 </span></a><span class="s0">But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed,</span>
<a name="l7043"><span class="ln">7043 </span></a><span class="s0">she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least</span>
<a name="l7044"><span class="ln">7044 </span></a><span class="s0">information about any body, that I really think you may say what you</span>
<a name="l7045"><span class="ln">7045 </span></a><span class="s0">like of your acquaintance with her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7046"><span class="ln">7046 </span></a>
<a name="l7047"><span class="ln">7047 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me</span>
<a name="l7048"><span class="ln">7048 </span></a><span class="s0">so well.  I met her frequently at Weymouth.  I had known the Campbells</span>
<a name="l7049"><span class="ln">7049 </span></a><span class="s0">a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.</span>
<a name="l7050"><span class="ln">7050 </span></a><span class="s0">Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,</span>
<a name="l7051"><span class="ln">7051 </span></a><span class="s0">warm-hearted woman.  I like them all.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7052"><span class="ln">7052 </span></a>
<a name="l7053"><span class="ln">7053 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she</span>
<a name="l7054"><span class="ln">7054 </span></a><span class="s0">is destined to be?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7055"><span class="ln">7055 </span></a>
<a name="l7056"><span class="ln">7056 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7057"><span class="ln">7057 </span></a>
<a name="l7058"><span class="ln">7058 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,&quot; said Mrs. Weston smiling;</span>
<a name="l7059"><span class="ln">7059 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows</span>
<a name="l7060"><span class="ln">7060 </span></a><span class="s0">what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life.</span>
<a name="l7061"><span class="ln">7061 </span></a><span class="s0">I will move a little farther off.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7062"><span class="ln">7062 </span></a>
<a name="l7063"><span class="ln">7063 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I certainly do forget to think of _her_,&quot; said Emma, &quot;as having ever</span>
<a name="l7064"><span class="ln">7064 </span></a><span class="s0">been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7065"><span class="ln">7065 </span></a>
<a name="l7066"><span class="ln">7066 </span></a><span class="s0">He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.</span>
<a name="l7067"><span class="ln">7067 </span></a>
<a name="l7068"><span class="ln">7068 </span></a><span class="s0">When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again,</span>
<a name="l7069"><span class="ln">7069 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7070"><span class="ln">7070 </span></a><span class="s0">said Frank Churchill.</span>
<a name="l7071"><span class="ln">7071 </span></a>
<a name="l7072"><span class="ln">7072 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ever hear her!&quot; repeated Emma.  &quot;You forget how much she belongs</span>
<a name="l7073"><span class="ln">7073 </span></a><span class="s0">to Highbury.  I have heard her every year of our lives since we</span>
<a name="l7074"><span class="ln">7074 </span></a><span class="s0">both began.  She plays charmingly.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7075"><span class="ln">7075 </span></a>
<a name="l7076"><span class="ln">7076 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who</span>
<a name="l7077"><span class="ln">7077 </span></a><span class="s0">could really judge.  She appeared to me to play well, that is,</span>
<a name="l7078"><span class="ln">7078 </span></a><span class="s0">with considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--</span>
<a name="l7079"><span class="ln">7079 </span></a><span class="s0">I am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill</span>
<a name="l7080"><span class="ln">7080 </span></a><span class="s0">or right of judging of any body's performance.--I have been used</span>
<a name="l7081"><span class="ln">7081 </span></a><span class="s0">to hear her's admired; and I remember one proof of her being</span>
<a name="l7082"><span class="ln">7082 </span></a><span class="s0">thought to play well:--a man, a very musical man, and in love</span>
<a name="l7083"><span class="ln">7083 </span></a><span class="s0">with another woman--engaged to her--on the point of marriage--</span>
<a name="l7084"><span class="ln">7084 </span></a><span class="s0">would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument,</span>
<a name="l7085"><span class="ln">7085 </span></a><span class="s0">if the lady in question could sit down instead--never seemed</span>
<a name="l7086"><span class="ln">7086 </span></a><span class="s0">to like to hear one if he could hear the other.  That, I thought,</span>
<a name="l7087"><span class="ln">7087 </span></a><span class="s0">in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7088"><span class="ln">7088 </span></a>
<a name="l7089"><span class="ln">7089 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Proof indeed!&quot; said Emma, highly amused.--&quot;Mr. Dixon is very musical,</span>
<a name="l7090"><span class="ln">7090 </span></a><span class="s0">is he?  We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,</span>
<a name="l7091"><span class="ln">7091 </span></a><span class="s0">than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7092"><span class="ln">7092 </span></a>
<a name="l7093"><span class="ln">7093 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought</span>
<a name="l7094"><span class="ln">7094 </span></a><span class="s0">it a very strong proof.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7095"><span class="ln">7095 </span></a>
<a name="l7096"><span class="ln">7096 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal</span>
<a name="l7097"><span class="ln">7097 </span></a><span class="s0">stronger than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all</span>
<a name="l7098"><span class="ln">7098 </span></a><span class="s0">agreeable to me.  I could not excuse a man's having more music</span>
<a name="l7099"><span class="ln">7099 </span></a><span class="s0">than love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine</span>
<a name="l7100"><span class="ln">7100 </span></a><span class="s0">sounds than to my feelings.  How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7101"><span class="ln">7101 </span></a>
<a name="l7102"><span class="ln">7102 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It was her very particular friend, you know.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7103"><span class="ln">7103 </span></a>
<a name="l7104"><span class="ln">7104 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Poor comfort!&quot; said Emma, laughing.  &quot;One would rather have a stranger</span>
<a name="l7105"><span class="ln">7105 </span></a><span class="s0">preferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might</span>
<a name="l7106"><span class="ln">7106 </span></a><span class="s0">not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend</span>
<a name="l7107"><span class="ln">7107 </span></a><span class="s0">always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--</span>
<a name="l7108"><span class="ln">7108 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor Mrs. Dixon!  Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7109"><span class="ln">7109 </span></a>
<a name="l7110"><span class="ln">7110 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are right.  It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell;</span>
<a name="l7111"><span class="ln">7111 </span></a><span class="s0">but she really did not seem to feel it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7112"><span class="ln">7112 </span></a>
<a name="l7113"><span class="ln">7113 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which.</span>
<a name="l7114"><span class="ln">7114 </span></a><span class="s0">But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship,</span>
<a name="l7115"><span class="ln">7115 </span></a><span class="s0">or dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have</span>
<a name="l7116"><span class="ln">7116 </span></a><span class="s0">felt it:  Miss Fairfax herself.  She must have felt the improper</span>
<a name="l7117"><span class="ln">7117 </span></a><span class="s0">and dangerous distinction.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7118"><span class="ln">7118 </span></a>
<a name="l7119"><span class="ln">7119 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;As to that--I do not--&quot;</span>
<a name="l7120"><span class="ln">7120 </span></a>
<a name="l7121"><span class="ln">7121 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's</span>
<a name="l7122"><span class="ln">7122 </span></a><span class="s0">sensations from you, or from any body else.  They are known to no</span>
<a name="l7123"><span class="ln">7123 </span></a><span class="s0">human being, I guess, but herself.  But if she continued to play</span>
<a name="l7124"><span class="ln">7124 </span></a><span class="s0">whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7125"><span class="ln">7125 </span></a>
<a name="l7126"><span class="ln">7126 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--&quot;</span>
<a name="l7127"><span class="ln">7127 </span></a><span class="s0">he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, &quot;however, it</span>
<a name="l7128"><span class="ln">7128 </span></a><span class="s0">is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--</span>
<a name="l7129"><span class="ln">7129 </span></a><span class="s0">how it might all be behind the scenes.  I can only say that there</span>
<a name="l7130"><span class="ln">7130 </span></a><span class="s0">was smoothness outwardly.  But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from</span>
<a name="l7131"><span class="ln">7131 </span></a><span class="s0">a child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she</span>
<a name="l7132"><span class="ln">7132 </span></a><span class="s0">is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7133"><span class="ln">7133 </span></a>
<a name="l7134"><span class="ln">7134 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children</span>
<a name="l7135"><span class="ln">7135 </span></a><span class="s0">and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should</span>
<a name="l7136"><span class="ln">7136 </span></a><span class="s0">be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever</span>
<a name="l7137"><span class="ln">7137 </span></a><span class="s0">she visited her friends.  But we never did.  I hardly know how it</span>
<a name="l7138"><span class="ln">7138 </span></a><span class="s0">has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side</span>
<a name="l7139"><span class="ln">7139 </span></a><span class="s0">which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized</span>
<a name="l7140"><span class="ln">7140 </span></a><span class="s0">and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother,</span>
<a name="l7141"><span class="ln">7141 </span></a><span class="s0">and all their set.  And then, her reserve--I never could attach</span>
<a name="l7142"><span class="ln">7142 </span></a><span class="s0">myself to any one so completely reserved.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7143"><span class="ln">7143 </span></a>
<a name="l7144"><span class="ln">7144 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,&quot; said he.  &quot;Oftentimes</span>
<a name="l7145"><span class="ln">7145 </span></a><span class="s0">very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing.  There is safety</span>
<a name="l7146"><span class="ln">7146 </span></a><span class="s0">in reserve, but no attraction.  One cannot love a reserved person.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7147"><span class="ln">7147 </span></a>
<a name="l7148"><span class="ln">7148 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction</span>
<a name="l7149"><span class="ln">7149 </span></a><span class="s0">may be the greater.  But I must be more in want of a friend,</span>
<a name="l7150"><span class="ln">7150 </span></a><span class="s0">or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take</span>
<a name="l7151"><span class="ln">7151 </span></a><span class="s0">the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one.</span>
<a name="l7152"><span class="ln">7152 </span></a><span class="s0">Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question.</span>
<a name="l7153"><span class="ln">7153 </span></a><span class="s0">I have no reason to think ill of her--not the least--except that</span>
<a name="l7154"><span class="ln">7154 </span></a><span class="s0">such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner,</span>
<a name="l7155"><span class="ln">7155 </span></a><span class="s0">such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt</span>
<a name="l7156"><span class="ln">7156 </span></a><span class="s0">to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7157"><span class="ln">7157 </span></a>
<a name="l7158"><span class="ln">7158 </span></a><span class="s0">He perfectly agreed with her:  and after walking together so long,</span>
<a name="l7159"><span class="ln">7159 </span></a><span class="s0">and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,</span>
<a name="l7160"><span class="ln">7160 </span></a><span class="s0">that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.</span>
<a name="l7161"><span class="ln">7161 </span></a><span class="s0">He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the</span>
<a name="l7162"><span class="ln">7162 </span></a><span class="s0">world in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune,</span>
<a name="l7163"><span class="ln">7163 </span></a><span class="s0">therefore better than she had expected.  His ideas seemed more moderate--</span>
<a name="l7164"><span class="ln">7164 </span></a><span class="s0">his feelings warmer.  She was particularly struck by his manner</span>
<a name="l7165"><span class="ln">7165 </span></a><span class="s0">of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church,</span>
<a name="l7166"><span class="ln">7166 </span></a><span class="s0">he would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much</span>
<a name="l7167"><span class="ln">7167 </span></a><span class="s0">fault with.  No, he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house</span>
<a name="l7168"><span class="ln">7168 </span></a><span class="s0">as a man was to be pitied for having.  If it were to be shared with</span>
<a name="l7169"><span class="ln">7169 </span></a><span class="s0">the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having</span>
<a name="l7170"><span class="ln">7170 </span></a><span class="s0">that house.  There must be ample room in it for every real comfort.</span>
<a name="l7171"><span class="ln">7171 </span></a><span class="s0">The man must be a blockhead who wanted more.</span>
<a name="l7172"><span class="ln">7172 </span></a>
<a name="l7173"><span class="ln">7173 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.</span>
<a name="l7174"><span class="ln">7174 </span></a><span class="s0">Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many</span>
<a name="l7175"><span class="ln">7175 </span></a><span class="s0">advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could</span>
<a name="l7176"><span class="ln">7176 </span></a><span class="s0">be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one.</span>
<a name="l7177"><span class="ln">7177 </span></a><span class="s0">But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he</span>
<a name="l7178"><span class="ln">7178 </span></a><span class="s0">was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination</span>
<a name="l7179"><span class="ln">7179 </span></a><span class="s0">to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.</span>
<a name="l7180"><span class="ln">7180 </span></a><span class="s0">He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be</span>
<a name="l7181"><span class="ln">7181 </span></a><span class="s0">occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry,</span>
<a name="l7182"><span class="ln">7182 </span></a><span class="s0">but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make</span>
<a name="l7183"><span class="ln">7183 </span></a><span class="s0">him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would willingly</span>
<a name="l7184"><span class="ln">7184 </span></a><span class="s0">give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.</span>
<a name="l7185"><span class="ln">7185 </span></a>
<a name="l7186"><span class="ln">7186 </span></a>
<a name="l7187"><span class="ln">7187 </span></a>
<a name="l7188"><span class="ln">7188 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>
<a name="l7189"><span class="ln">7189 </span></a>
<a name="l7190"><span class="ln">7190 </span></a>
<a name="l7191"><span class="ln">7191 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken</span>
<a name="l7192"><span class="ln">7192 </span></a><span class="s0">the following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London,</span>
<a name="l7193"><span class="ln">7193 </span></a><span class="s0">merely to have his hair cut.  A sudden freak seemed to have seized him</span>
<a name="l7194"><span class="ln">7194 </span></a><span class="s0">at breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to</span>
<a name="l7195"><span class="ln">7195 </span></a><span class="s0">return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than</span>
<a name="l7196"><span class="ln">7196 </span></a><span class="s0">having his hair cut.  There was certainly no harm in his travelling</span>
<a name="l7197"><span class="ln">7197 </span></a><span class="s0">sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air</span>
<a name="l7198"><span class="ln">7198 </span></a><span class="s0">of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve.  It did</span>
<a name="l7199"><span class="ln">7199 </span></a><span class="s0">not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense,</span>
<a name="l7200"><span class="ln">7200 </span></a><span class="s0">or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself</span>
<a name="l7201"><span class="ln">7201 </span></a><span class="s0">to discern in him yesterday.  Vanity, extravagance, love of change,</span>
<a name="l7202"><span class="ln">7202 </span></a><span class="s0">restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;</span>
<a name="l7203"><span class="ln">7203 </span></a><span class="s0">heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l7204"><span class="ln">7204 </span></a><span class="s0">indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became</span>
<a name="l7205"><span class="ln">7205 </span></a><span class="s0">liable to all these charges.  His father only called him a coxcomb,</span>
<a name="l7206"><span class="ln">7206 </span></a><span class="s0">and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it,</span>
<a name="l7207"><span class="ln">7207 </span></a><span class="s0">was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible,</span>
<a name="l7208"><span class="ln">7208 </span></a><span class="s0">and making no other comment than that &quot;all young people would have</span>
<a name="l7209"><span class="ln">7209 </span></a><span class="s0">their little whims.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7210"><span class="ln">7210 </span></a>
<a name="l7211"><span class="ln">7211 </span></a><span class="s0">With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit</span>
<a name="l7212"><span class="ln">7212 </span></a><span class="s0">hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him.  Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l7213"><span class="ln">7213 </span></a><span class="s0">was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he</span>
<a name="l7214"><span class="ln">7214 </span></a><span class="s0">made himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether.</span>
<a name="l7215"><span class="ln">7215 </span></a><span class="s0">He appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful</span>
<a name="l7216"><span class="ln">7216 </span></a><span class="s0">and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions,</span>
<a name="l7217"><span class="ln">7217 </span></a><span class="s0">a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard,</span>
<a name="l7218"><span class="ln">7218 </span></a><span class="s0">was fond of talking of him--said he would be the best man in the</span>
<a name="l7219"><span class="ln">7219 </span></a><span class="s0">world if he were left to himself; and though there was no being</span>
<a name="l7220"><span class="ln">7220 </span></a><span class="s0">attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude,</span>
<a name="l7221"><span class="ln">7221 </span></a><span class="s0">and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect.</span>
<a name="l7222"><span class="ln">7222 </span></a><span class="s0">This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy</span>
<a name="l7223"><span class="ln">7223 </span></a><span class="s0">for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy</span>
<a name="l7224"><span class="ln">7224 </span></a><span class="s0">of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him;</span>
<a name="l7225"><span class="ln">7225 </span></a><span class="s0">the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being</span>
<a name="l7226"><span class="ln">7226 </span></a><span class="s0">at least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference--</span>
<a name="l7227"><span class="ln">7227 </span></a><span class="s0">(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour, in short,</span>
<a name="l7228"><span class="ln">7228 </span></a><span class="s0">of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.</span>
<a name="l7229"><span class="ln">7229 </span></a>
<a name="l7230"><span class="ln">7230 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must</span>
<a name="l7231"><span class="ln">7231 </span></a><span class="s0">have some weight.  He gave her to understand that Frank admired</span>
<a name="l7232"><span class="ln">7232 </span></a><span class="s0">her extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming;</span>
<a name="l7233"><span class="ln">7233 </span></a><span class="s0">and with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must</span>
<a name="l7234"><span class="ln">7234 </span></a><span class="s0">not judge him harshly.  As Mrs. Weston observed, &quot;all young people</span>
<a name="l7235"><span class="ln">7235 </span></a><span class="s0">would have their little whims.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7236"><span class="ln">7236 </span></a>
<a name="l7237"><span class="ln">7237 </span></a><span class="s0">There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so</span>
<a name="l7238"><span class="ln">7238 </span></a><span class="s0">leniently disposed.  In general he was judged, throughout the parishes</span>
<a name="l7239"><span class="ln">7239 </span></a><span class="s0">of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances</span>
<a name="l7240"><span class="ln">7240 </span></a><span class="s0">were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--</span>
<a name="l7241"><span class="ln">7241 </span></a><span class="s0">one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit</span>
<a name="l7242"><span class="ln">7242 </span></a><span class="s0">among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows</span>
<a name="l7243"><span class="ln">7243 </span></a><span class="s0">or smiles--Mr. Knightley.  The circumstance was told him at Hartfield;</span>
<a name="l7244"><span class="ln">7244 </span></a><span class="s0">for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately</span>
<a name="l7245"><span class="ln">7245 </span></a><span class="s0">afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand,</span>
<a name="l7246"><span class="ln">7246 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for.&quot;  She had</span>
<a name="l7247"><span class="ln">7247 </span></a><span class="s0">half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced</span>
<a name="l7248"><span class="ln">7248 </span></a><span class="s0">her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings,</span>
<a name="l7249"><span class="ln">7249 </span></a><span class="s0">and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.</span>
<a name="l7250"><span class="ln">7250 </span></a>
<a name="l7251"><span class="ln">7251 </span></a><span class="s0">Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings,</span>
<a name="l7252"><span class="ln">7252 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect</span>
<a name="l7253"><span class="ln">7253 </span></a><span class="s0">particularly opportune.  Something occurred while they were</span>
<a name="l7254"><span class="ln">7254 </span></a><span class="s0">at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was</span>
<a name="l7255"><span class="ln">7255 </span></a><span class="s0">still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.</span>
<a name="l7256"><span class="ln">7256 </span></a>
<a name="l7257"><span class="ln">7257 </span></a><span class="s0">This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years</span>
<a name="l7258"><span class="ln">7258 </span></a><span class="s0">in Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal,</span>
<a name="l7259"><span class="ln">7259 </span></a><span class="s0">and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin,</span>
<a name="l7260"><span class="ln">7260 </span></a><span class="s0">in trade, and only moderately genteel.  On their first coming into</span>
<a name="l7261"><span class="ln">7261 </span></a><span class="s0">the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly,</span>
<a name="l7262"><span class="ln">7262 </span></a><span class="s0">keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last</span>
<a name="l7263"><span class="ln">7263 </span></a><span class="s0">year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means--</span>
<a name="l7264"><span class="ln">7264 </span></a><span class="s0">the house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general</span>
<a name="l7265"><span class="ln">7265 </span></a><span class="s0">had smiled on them.  With their wealth, their views increased;</span>
<a name="l7266"><span class="ln">7266 </span></a><span class="s0">their want of a larger house, their inclination for more company.</span>
<a name="l7267"><span class="ln">7267 </span></a><span class="s0">They added to their house, to their number of servants,</span>
<a name="l7268"><span class="ln">7268 </span></a><span class="s0">to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune</span>
<a name="l7269"><span class="ln">7269 </span></a><span class="s0">and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l7270"><span class="ln">7270 </span></a><span class="s0">Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body</span>
<a name="l7271"><span class="ln">7271 </span></a><span class="s0">for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among</span>
<a name="l7272"><span class="ln">7272 </span></a><span class="s0">the single men, had already taken place.  The regular and best</span>
<a name="l7273"><span class="ln">7273 </span></a><span class="s0">families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--</span>
<a name="l7274"><span class="ln">7274 </span></a><span class="s0">neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls.  Nothing should</span>
<a name="l7275"><span class="ln">7275 </span></a><span class="s0">tempt _her_ to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father's</span>
<a name="l7276"><span class="ln">7276 </span></a><span class="s0">known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she</span>
<a name="l7277"><span class="ln">7277 </span></a><span class="s0">could wish.  The Coles were very respectable in their way, but they</span>
<a name="l7278"><span class="ln">7278 </span></a><span class="s0">ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms</span>
<a name="l7279"><span class="ln">7279 </span></a><span class="s0">on which the superior families would visit them.  This lesson,</span>
<a name="l7280"><span class="ln">7280 </span></a><span class="s0">she very much feared, they would receive only from herself;</span>
<a name="l7281"><span class="ln">7281 </span></a><span class="s0">she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.</span>
<a name="l7282"><span class="ln">7282 </span></a>
<a name="l7283"><span class="ln">7283 </span></a><span class="s0">But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many</span>
<a name="l7284"><span class="ln">7284 </span></a><span class="s0">weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last,</span>
<a name="l7285"><span class="ln">7285 </span></a><span class="s0">it found her very differently affected.  Donwell and Randalls</span>
<a name="l7286"><span class="ln">7286 </span></a><span class="s0">had received their invitation, and none had come for her father</span>
<a name="l7287"><span class="ln">7287 </span></a><span class="s0">and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with &quot;I suppose</span>
<a name="l7288"><span class="ln">7288 </span></a><span class="s0">they will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not</span>
<a name="l7289"><span class="ln">7289 </span></a><span class="s0">dine out,&quot; was not quite sufficient.  She felt that she should</span>
<a name="l7290"><span class="ln">7290 </span></a><span class="s0">like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea</span>
<a name="l7291"><span class="ln">7291 </span></a><span class="s0">of the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those</span>
<a name="l7292"><span class="ln">7292 </span></a><span class="s0">whose society was dearest to her, occurred again and again,</span>
<a name="l7293"><span class="ln">7293 </span></a><span class="s0">she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept.</span>
<a name="l7294"><span class="ln">7294 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses.  They had</span>
<a name="l7295"><span class="ln">7295 </span></a><span class="s0">been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,</span>
<a name="l7296"><span class="ln">7296 </span></a><span class="s0">and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence.</span>
<a name="l7297"><span class="ln">7297 </span></a><span class="s0">Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his.</span>
<a name="l7298"><span class="ln">7298 </span></a><span class="s0">The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits;</span>
<a name="l7299"><span class="ln">7299 </span></a><span class="s0">and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission</span>
<a name="l7300"><span class="ln">7300 </span></a><span class="s0">to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.</span>
<a name="l7301"><span class="ln">7301 </span></a>
<a name="l7302"><span class="ln">7302 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were</span>
<a name="l7303"><span class="ln">7303 </span></a><span class="s0">at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her</span>
<a name="l7304"><span class="ln">7304 </span></a><span class="s0">first remark, on reading it, was that &quot;of course it must be declined,&quot;</span>
<a name="l7305"><span class="ln">7305 </span></a><span class="s0">she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,</span>
<a name="l7306"><span class="ln">7306 </span></a><span class="s0">that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.</span>
<a name="l7307"><span class="ln">7307 </span></a>
<a name="l7308"><span class="ln">7308 </span></a><span class="s0">She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely</span>
<a name="l7309"><span class="ln">7309 </span></a><span class="s0">without inclination for the party.  The Coles expressed themselves</span>
<a name="l7310"><span class="ln">7310 </span></a><span class="s0">so properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--</span>
<a name="l7311"><span class="ln">7311 </span></a><span class="s0">so much consideration for her father.  &quot;They would have solicited the</span>
<a name="l7312"><span class="ln">7312 </span></a><span class="s0">honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen</span>
<a name="l7313"><span class="ln">7313 </span></a><span class="s0">from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught</span>
<a name="l7314"><span class="ln">7314 </span></a><span class="s0">of air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the</span>
<a name="l7315"><span class="ln">7315 </span></a><span class="s0">honour of his company.&quot;  Upon the whole, she was very persuadable;</span>
<a name="l7316"><span class="ln">7316 </span></a><span class="s0">and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be</span>
<a name="l7317"><span class="ln">7317 </span></a><span class="s0">done without neglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard,</span>
<a name="l7318"><span class="ln">7318 </span></a><span class="s0">if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him company--</span>
<a name="l7319"><span class="ln">7319 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter's</span>
<a name="l7320"><span class="ln">7320 </span></a><span class="s0">going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending</span>
<a name="l7321"><span class="ln">7321 </span></a><span class="s0">the whole evening away from him.  As for _his_ going, Emma did</span>
<a name="l7322"><span class="ln">7322 </span></a><span class="s0">not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late,</span>
<a name="l7323"><span class="ln">7323 </span></a><span class="s0">and the party too numerous.  He was soon pretty well resigned.</span>
<a name="l7324"><span class="ln">7324 </span></a>
<a name="l7325"><span class="ln">7325 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am not fond of dinner-visiting,&quot; said he--&quot;I never was.</span>
<a name="l7326"><span class="ln">7326 </span></a><span class="s0">No more is Emma.  Late hours do not agree with us.  I am sorry</span>
<a name="l7327"><span class="ln">7327 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it.  I think it would be</span>
<a name="l7328"><span class="ln">7328 </span></a><span class="s0">much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer,</span>
<a name="l7329"><span class="ln">7329 </span></a><span class="s0">and take their tea with us--take us in their afternoon walk;</span>
<a name="l7330"><span class="ln">7330 </span></a><span class="s0">which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home</span>
<a name="l7331"><span class="ln">7331 </span></a><span class="s0">without being out in the damp of the evening.  The dews of a summer</span>
<a name="l7332"><span class="ln">7332 </span></a><span class="s0">evening are what I would not expose any body to.  However, as they</span>
<a name="l7333"><span class="ln">7333 </span></a><span class="s0">are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you</span>
<a name="l7334"><span class="ln">7334 </span></a><span class="s0">will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her,</span>
<a name="l7335"><span class="ln">7335 </span></a><span class="s0">I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought,</span>
<a name="l7336"><span class="ln">7336 </span></a><span class="s0">neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.&quot;  Then turning to Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l7337"><span class="ln">7337 </span></a><span class="s0">with a look of gentle reproach--&quot;Ah!  Miss Taylor, if you had</span>
<a name="l7338"><span class="ln">7338 </span></a><span class="s0">not married, you would have staid at home with me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7339"><span class="ln">7339 </span></a>
<a name="l7340"><span class="ln">7340 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, sir,&quot; cried Mr. Weston, &quot;as I took Miss Taylor away,</span>
<a name="l7341"><span class="ln">7341 </span></a><span class="s0">it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will</span>
<a name="l7342"><span class="ln">7342 </span></a><span class="s0">step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7343"><span class="ln">7343 </span></a>
<a name="l7344"><span class="ln">7344 </span></a><span class="s0">But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,</span>
<a name="l7345"><span class="ln">7345 </span></a><span class="s0">not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation.  The ladies knew better</span>
<a name="l7346"><span class="ln">7346 </span></a><span class="s0">how to allay it.  Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing</span>
<a name="l7347"><span class="ln">7347 </span></a><span class="s0">deliberately arranged.</span>
<a name="l7348"><span class="ln">7348 </span></a>
<a name="l7349"><span class="ln">7349 </span></a><span class="s0">With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough</span>
<a name="l7350"><span class="ln">7350 </span></a><span class="s0">for talking as usual.  &quot;He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard.</span>
<a name="l7351"><span class="ln">7351 </span></a><span class="s0">He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line,</span>
<a name="l7352"><span class="ln">7352 </span></a><span class="s0">and invite her.  James could take the note.  But first of all,</span>
<a name="l7353"><span class="ln">7353 </span></a><span class="s0">there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7354"><span class="ln">7354 </span></a>
<a name="l7355"><span class="ln">7355 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible.  You will</span>
<a name="l7356"><span class="ln">7356 </span></a><span class="s0">say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must</span>
<a name="l7357"><span class="ln">7357 </span></a><span class="s0">decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_,</span>
<a name="l7358"><span class="ln">7358 </span></a><span class="s0">of course.  But you will do every thing right.  I need not tell you</span>
<a name="l7359"><span class="ln">7359 </span></a><span class="s0">what is to be done.  We must remember to let James know that the carriage</span>
<a name="l7360"><span class="ln">7360 </span></a><span class="s0">will be wanted on Tuesday.  I shall have no fears for you with him.</span>
<a name="l7361"><span class="ln">7361 </span></a><span class="s0">We have never been there above once since the new approach was made;</span>
<a name="l7362"><span class="ln">7362 </span></a><span class="s0">but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely.</span>
<a name="l7363"><span class="ln">7363 </span></a><span class="s0">And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would</span>
<a name="l7364"><span class="ln">7364 </span></a><span class="s0">have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour.</span>
<a name="l7365"><span class="ln">7365 </span></a><span class="s0">You will not like staying late.  You will get very tired when tea</span>
<a name="l7366"><span class="ln">7366 </span></a><span class="s0">is over.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7367"><span class="ln">7367 </span></a>
<a name="l7368"><span class="ln">7368 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7369"><span class="ln">7369 </span></a>
<a name="l7370"><span class="ln">7370 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired.  There will be</span>
<a name="l7371"><span class="ln">7371 </span></a><span class="s0">a great many people talking at once.  You will not like the noise.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7372"><span class="ln">7372 </span></a>
<a name="l7373"><span class="ln">7373 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But, my dear sir,&quot; cried Mr. Weston, &quot;if Emma comes away early,</span>
<a name="l7374"><span class="ln">7374 </span></a><span class="s0">it will be breaking up the party.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7375"><span class="ln">7375 </span></a>
<a name="l7376"><span class="ln">7376 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And no great harm if it does,&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse.  &quot;The sooner</span>
<a name="l7377"><span class="ln">7377 </span></a><span class="s0">every party breaks up, the better.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7378"><span class="ln">7378 </span></a>
<a name="l7379"><span class="ln">7379 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles.</span>
<a name="l7380"><span class="ln">7380 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence.</span>
<a name="l7381"><span class="ln">7381 </span></a><span class="s0">They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims;</span>
<a name="l7382"><span class="ln">7382 </span></a><span class="s0">but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no</span>
<a name="l7383"><span class="ln">7383 </span></a><span class="s0">great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought</span>
<a name="l7384"><span class="ln">7384 </span></a><span class="s0">of than any other person's in the room.  You would not wish to disappoint</span>
<a name="l7385"><span class="ln">7385 </span></a><span class="s0">and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people</span>
<a name="l7386"><span class="ln">7386 </span></a><span class="s0">as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7387"><span class="ln">7387 </span></a>
<a name="l7388"><span class="ln">7388 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged</span>
<a name="l7389"><span class="ln">7389 </span></a><span class="s0">to you for reminding me.  I should be extremely sorry to be giving</span>
<a name="l7390"><span class="ln">7390 </span></a><span class="s0">them any pain.  I know what worthy people they are.  Perry tells</span>
<a name="l7391"><span class="ln">7391 </span></a><span class="s0">me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor.  You would not think</span>
<a name="l7392"><span class="ln">7392 </span></a><span class="s0">it to look at him, but he is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious.</span>
<a name="l7393"><span class="ln">7393 </span></a><span class="s0">No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain.  My dear Emma,</span>
<a name="l7394"><span class="ln">7394 </span></a><span class="s0">we must consider this.  I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting</span>
<a name="l7395"><span class="ln">7395 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.</span>
<a name="l7396"><span class="ln">7396 </span></a><span class="s0">You will not regard being tired.  You will be perfectly safe,</span>
<a name="l7397"><span class="ln">7397 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, among your friends.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7398"><span class="ln">7398 </span></a>
<a name="l7399"><span class="ln">7399 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh yes, papa.  I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have</span>
<a name="l7400"><span class="ln">7400 </span></a><span class="s0">no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account.</span>
<a name="l7401"><span class="ln">7401 </span></a><span class="s0">I am only afraid of your sitting up for me.  I am not afraid</span>
<a name="l7402"><span class="ln">7402 </span></a><span class="s0">of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard.</span>
<a name="l7403"><span class="ln">7403 </span></a><span class="s0">She loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid</span>
<a name="l7404"><span class="ln">7404 </span></a><span class="s0">you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your</span>
<a name="l7405"><span class="ln">7405 </span></a><span class="s0">usual time--and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.</span>
<a name="l7406"><span class="ln">7406 </span></a><span class="s0">You must promise me not to sit up.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7407"><span class="ln">7407 </span></a>
<a name="l7408"><span class="ln">7408 </span></a><span class="s0">He did, on the condition of some promises on her side:  such as that,</span>
<a name="l7409"><span class="ln">7409 </span></a><span class="s0">if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly;</span>
<a name="l7410"><span class="ln">7410 </span></a><span class="s0">if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid</span>
<a name="l7411"><span class="ln">7411 </span></a><span class="s0">should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see</span>
<a name="l7412"><span class="ln">7412 </span></a><span class="s0">that every thing were safe in the house, as usual.</span>
<a name="l7413"><span class="ln">7413 </span></a>
<a name="l7414"><span class="ln">7414 </span></a>
<a name="l7415"><span class="ln">7415 </span></a>
<a name="l7416"><span class="ln">7416 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<a name="l7417"><span class="ln">7417 </span></a>
<a name="l7418"><span class="ln">7418 </span></a>
<a name="l7419"><span class="ln">7419 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's</span>
<a name="l7420"><span class="ln">7420 </span></a><span class="s0">dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l7421"><span class="ln">7421 </span></a><span class="s0">was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l7422"><span class="ln">7422 </span></a><span class="s0">to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.</span>
<a name="l7423"><span class="ln">7423 </span></a>
<a name="l7424"><span class="ln">7424 </span></a><span class="s0">He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with</span>
<a name="l7425"><span class="ln">7425 </span></a><span class="s0">a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed</span>
<a name="l7426"><span class="ln">7426 </span></a><span class="s0">of what he had done.  He had no reason to wish his hair longer,</span>
<a name="l7427"><span class="ln">7427 </span></a><span class="s0">to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent,</span>
<a name="l7428"><span class="ln">7428 </span></a><span class="s0">to improve his spirits.  He was quite as undaunted and as lively</span>
<a name="l7429"><span class="ln">7429 </span></a><span class="s0">as ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:--</span>
<a name="l7430"><span class="ln">7430 </span></a>
<a name="l7431"><span class="ln">7431 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things</span>
<a name="l7432"><span class="ln">7432 </span></a><span class="s0">do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an</span>
<a name="l7433"><span class="ln">7433 </span></a><span class="s0">impudent way.  Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not</span>
<a name="l7434"><span class="ln">7434 </span></a><span class="s0">always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it.</span>
<a name="l7435"><span class="ln">7435 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, he is _not_ a trifling, silly young man.  If he were,</span>
<a name="l7436"><span class="ln">7436 </span></a><span class="s0">he would have done this differently.  He would either have gloried</span>
<a name="l7437"><span class="ln">7437 </span></a><span class="s0">in the achievement, or been ashamed of it.  There would have been</span>
<a name="l7438"><span class="ln">7438 </span></a><span class="s0">either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too</span>
<a name="l7439"><span class="ln">7439 </span></a><span class="s0">weak to defend its own vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he</span>
<a name="l7440"><span class="ln">7440 </span></a><span class="s0">is not trifling or silly.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7441"><span class="ln">7441 </span></a>
<a name="l7442"><span class="ln">7442 </span></a><span class="s0">With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again,</span>
<a name="l7443"><span class="ln">7443 </span></a><span class="s0">and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners,</span>
<a name="l7444"><span class="ln">7444 </span></a><span class="s0">and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself;</span>
<a name="l7445"><span class="ln">7445 </span></a><span class="s0">of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness</span>
<a name="l7446"><span class="ln">7446 </span></a><span class="s0">into her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those</span>
<a name="l7447"><span class="ln">7447 </span></a><span class="s0">might be, who were now seeing them together for the first time.</span>
<a name="l7448"><span class="ln">7448 </span></a>
<a name="l7449"><span class="ln">7449 </span></a><span class="s0">She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at</span>
<a name="l7450"><span class="ln">7450 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings</span>
<a name="l7451"><span class="ln">7451 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed</span>
<a name="l7452"><span class="ln">7452 </span></a><span class="s0">her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.</span>
<a name="l7453"><span class="ln">7453 </span></a>
<a name="l7454"><span class="ln">7454 </span></a><span class="s0">Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as</span>
<a name="l7455"><span class="ln">7455 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty,</span>
<a name="l7456"><span class="ln">7456 </span></a><span class="s0">before she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as</span>
<a name="l7457"><span class="ln">7457 </span></a><span class="s0">they sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly</span>
<a name="l7458"><span class="ln">7458 </span></a><span class="s0">noticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all</span>
<a name="l7459"><span class="ln">7459 </span></a><span class="s0">the amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake</span>
<a name="l7460"><span class="ln">7460 </span></a><span class="s0">and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his</span>
<a name="l7461"><span class="ln">7461 </span></a><span class="s0">care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise</span>
<a name="l7462"><span class="ln">7462 </span></a><span class="s0">during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them;</span>
<a name="l7463"><span class="ln">7463 </span></a><span class="s0">she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it.</span>
<a name="l7464"><span class="ln">7464 </span></a>
<a name="l7465"><span class="ln">7465 </span></a><span class="s0">She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased</span>
<a name="l7466"><span class="ln">7466 </span></a><span class="s0">to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping</span>
<a name="l7467"><span class="ln">7467 </span></a><span class="s0">no horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health,</span>
<a name="l7468"><span class="ln">7468 </span></a><span class="s0">activity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get</span>
<a name="l7469"><span class="ln">7469 </span></a><span class="s0">about as he could, and not use his carriage so often as became</span>
<a name="l7470"><span class="ln">7470 </span></a><span class="s0">the owner of Donwell Abbey.  She had an opportunity now of speaking</span>
<a name="l7471"><span class="ln">7471 </span></a><span class="s0">her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her out.</span>
<a name="l7472"><span class="ln">7472 </span></a>
<a name="l7473"><span class="ln">7473 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This is coming as you should do,&quot; said she; &quot;like a gentleman.--</span>
<a name="l7474"><span class="ln">7474 </span></a><span class="s0">I am quite glad to see you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7475"><span class="ln">7475 </span></a>
<a name="l7476"><span class="ln">7476 </span></a><span class="s0">He thanked her, observing, &quot;How lucky that we should arrive at the same</span>
<a name="l7477"><span class="ln">7477 </span></a><span class="s0">moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether</span>
<a name="l7478"><span class="ln">7478 </span></a><span class="s0">you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--</span>
<a name="l7479"><span class="ln">7479 </span></a><span class="s0">You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7480"><span class="ln">7480 </span></a>
<a name="l7481"><span class="ln">7481 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes I should, I am sure I should.  There is always a look of</span>
<a name="l7482"><span class="ln">7482 </span></a><span class="s0">consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know</span>
<a name="l7483"><span class="ln">7483 </span></a><span class="s0">to be beneath them.  You think you carry it off very well, I dare say,</span>
<a name="l7484"><span class="ln">7484 </span></a><span class="s0">but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern;</span>
<a name="l7485"><span class="ln">7485 </span></a><span class="s0">I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances.</span>
<a name="l7486"><span class="ln">7486 </span></a><span class="s0">_Now_ you have nothing to try for.  You are not afraid of being</span>
<a name="l7487"><span class="ln">7487 </span></a><span class="s0">supposed ashamed.  You are not striving to look taller than any</span>
<a name="l7488"><span class="ln">7488 </span></a><span class="s0">body else.  _Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same</span>
<a name="l7489"><span class="ln">7489 </span></a><span class="s0">room with you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7490"><span class="ln">7490 </span></a>
<a name="l7491"><span class="ln">7491 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nonsensical girl!&quot; was his reply, but not at all in anger.</span>
<a name="l7492"><span class="ln">7492 </span></a>
<a name="l7493"><span class="ln">7493 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party</span>
<a name="l7494"><span class="ln">7494 </span></a><span class="s0">as with Mr. Knightley.  She was received with a cordial respect</span>
<a name="l7495"><span class="ln">7495 </span></a><span class="s0">which could not but please, and given all the consequence she could</span>
<a name="l7496"><span class="ln">7496 </span></a><span class="s0">wish for.  When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love,</span>
<a name="l7497"><span class="ln">7497 </span></a><span class="s0">the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife;</span>
<a name="l7498"><span class="ln">7498 </span></a><span class="s0">the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked</span>
<a name="l7499"><span class="ln">7499 </span></a><span class="s0">her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated</span>
<a name="l7500"><span class="ln">7500 </span></a><span class="s0">by her--and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity</span>
<a name="l7501"><span class="ln">7501 </span></a><span class="s0">on his side.</span>
<a name="l7502"><span class="ln">7502 </span></a>
<a name="l7503"><span class="ln">7503 </span></a><span class="s0">The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper</span>
<a name="l7504"><span class="ln">7504 </span></a><span class="s0">unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of</span>
<a name="l7505"><span class="ln">7505 </span></a><span class="s0">naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family,</span>
<a name="l7506"><span class="ln">7506 </span></a><span class="s0">the lawyer of Highbury.  The less worthy females were to come</span>
<a name="l7507"><span class="ln">7507 </span></a><span class="s0">in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith;</span>
<a name="l7508"><span class="ln">7508 </span></a><span class="s0">but already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject</span>
<a name="l7509"><span class="ln">7509 </span></a><span class="s0">of conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l7510"><span class="ln">7510 </span></a><span class="s0">were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to</span>
<a name="l7511"><span class="ln">7511 </span></a><span class="s0">the pleasantness of her neighbour.  The first remote sound to which</span>
<a name="l7512"><span class="ln">7512 </span></a><span class="s0">she felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax.</span>
<a name="l7513"><span class="ln">7513 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be</span>
<a name="l7514"><span class="ln">7514 </span></a><span class="s0">very interesting.  She listened, and found it well worth listening to.</span>
<a name="l7515"><span class="ln">7515 </span></a><span class="s0">That very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply.</span>
<a name="l7516"><span class="ln">7516 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates,</span>
<a name="l7517"><span class="ln">7517 </span></a><span class="s0">and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight</span>
<a name="l7518"><span class="ln">7518 </span></a><span class="s0">of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a grand,</span>
<a name="l7519"><span class="ln">7519 </span></a><span class="s0">but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story,</span>
<a name="l7520"><span class="ln">7520 </span></a><span class="s0">the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry,</span>
<a name="l7521"><span class="ln">7521 </span></a><span class="s0">and congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was,</span>
<a name="l7522"><span class="ln">7522 </span></a><span class="s0">that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before,</span>
<a name="l7523"><span class="ln">7523 </span></a><span class="s0">to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected;</span>
<a name="l7524"><span class="ln">7524 </span></a><span class="s0">that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at</span>
<a name="l7525"><span class="ln">7525 </span></a><span class="s0">a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it--</span>
<a name="l7526"><span class="ln">7526 </span></a><span class="s0">but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only</span>
<a name="l7527"><span class="ln">7527 </span></a><span class="s0">one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell.</span>
<a name="l7528"><span class="ln">7528 </span></a>
<a name="l7529"><span class="ln">7529 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;One can suppose nothing else,&quot; added Mrs. Cole, &quot;and I was only</span>
<a name="l7530"><span class="ln">7530 </span></a><span class="s0">surprized that there could ever have been a doubt.  But Jane,</span>
<a name="l7531"><span class="ln">7531 </span></a><span class="s0">it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said</span>
<a name="l7532"><span class="ln">7532 </span></a><span class="s0">about it.  She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their</span>
<a name="l7533"><span class="ln">7533 </span></a><span class="s0">silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present.</span>
<a name="l7534"><span class="ln">7534 </span></a><span class="s0">They might chuse to surprize her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7535"><span class="ln">7535 </span></a>
<a name="l7536"><span class="ln">7536 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the</span>
<a name="l7537"><span class="ln">7537 </span></a><span class="s0">subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,</span>
<a name="l7538"><span class="ln">7538 </span></a><span class="s0">and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there</span>
<a name="l7539"><span class="ln">7539 </span></a><span class="s0">were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way,</span>
<a name="l7540"><span class="ln">7540 </span></a><span class="s0">and still listen to Mrs. Cole.</span>
<a name="l7541"><span class="ln">7541 </span></a>
<a name="l7542"><span class="ln">7542 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given</span>
<a name="l7543"><span class="ln">7543 </span></a><span class="s0">me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax,</span>
<a name="l7544"><span class="ln">7544 </span></a><span class="s0">who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument.</span>
<a name="l7545"><span class="ln">7545 </span></a><span class="s0">It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses</span>
<a name="l7546"><span class="ln">7546 </span></a><span class="s0">there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away.</span>
<a name="l7547"><span class="ln">7547 </span></a><span class="s0">This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was</span>
<a name="l7548"><span class="ln">7548 </span></a><span class="s0">but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed</span>
<a name="l7549"><span class="ln">7549 </span></a><span class="s0">to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I</span>
<a name="l7550"><span class="ln">7550 </span></a><span class="s0">do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are</span>
<a name="l7551"><span class="ln">7551 </span></a><span class="s0">but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it;</span>
<a name="l7552"><span class="ln">7552 </span></a><span class="s0">and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not</span>
<a name="l7553"><span class="ln">7553 </span></a><span class="s0">any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest</span>
<a name="l7554"><span class="ln">7554 </span></a><span class="s0">old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this</span>
<a name="l7555"><span class="ln">7555 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he</span>
<a name="l7556"><span class="ln">7556 </span></a><span class="s0">is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging</span>
<a name="l7557"><span class="ln">7557 </span></a><span class="s0">himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might</span>
<a name="l7558"><span class="ln">7558 </span></a><span class="s0">be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can;</span>
<a name="l7559"><span class="ln">7559 </span></a><span class="s0">and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought--</span>
<a name="l7560"><span class="ln">7560 </span></a><span class="s0">or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great</span>
<a name="l7561"><span class="ln">7561 </span></a><span class="s0">hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7562"><span class="ln">7562 </span></a>
<a name="l7563"><span class="ln">7563 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing</span>
<a name="l7564"><span class="ln">7564 </span></a><span class="s0">more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's,</span>
<a name="l7565"><span class="ln">7565 </span></a><span class="s0">turned to Frank Churchill.</span>
<a name="l7566"><span class="ln">7566 </span></a>
<a name="l7567"><span class="ln">7567 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Why do you smile?&quot; said she.</span>
<a name="l7568"><span class="ln">7568 </span></a>
<a name="l7569"><span class="ln">7569 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nay, why do you?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7570"><span class="ln">7570 </span></a>
<a name="l7571"><span class="ln">7571 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being</span>
<a name="l7572"><span class="ln">7572 </span></a><span class="s0">so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7573"><span class="ln">7573 </span></a>
<a name="l7574"><span class="ln">7574 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7575"><span class="ln">7575 </span></a>
<a name="l7576"><span class="ln">7576 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I rather wonder that it was never made before.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7577"><span class="ln">7577 </span></a>
<a name="l7578"><span class="ln">7578 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7579"><span class="ln">7579 </span></a>
<a name="l7580"><span class="ln">7580 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--</span>
<a name="l7581"><span class="ln">7581 </span></a><span class="s0">which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7582"><span class="ln">7582 </span></a>
<a name="l7583"><span class="ln">7583 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large</span>
<a name="l7584"><span class="ln">7584 </span></a><span class="s0">for Mrs. Bates's house.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7585"><span class="ln">7585 </span></a>
<a name="l7586"><span class="ln">7586 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies</span>
<a name="l7587"><span class="ln">7587 </span></a><span class="s0">that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7588"><span class="ln">7588 </span></a>
<a name="l7589"><span class="ln">7589 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not know.  I rather believe you are giving me more credit for</span>
<a name="l7590"><span class="ln">7590 </span></a><span class="s0">acuteness than I deserve.  I smile because you smile, and shall probably</span>
<a name="l7591"><span class="ln">7591 </span></a><span class="s0">suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what</span>
<a name="l7592"><span class="ln">7592 </span></a><span class="s0">there is to question.  If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7593"><span class="ln">7593 </span></a>
<a name="l7594"><span class="ln">7594 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7595"><span class="ln">7595 </span></a>
<a name="l7596"><span class="ln">7596 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed.  I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon.</span>
<a name="l7597"><span class="ln">7597 </span></a><span class="s0">She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument</span>
<a name="l7598"><span class="ln">7598 </span></a><span class="s0">would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize,</span>
<a name="l7599"><span class="ln">7599 </span></a><span class="s0">is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It</span>
<a name="l7600"><span class="ln">7600 </span></a><span class="s0">is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say.  I told you that your suspicions would</span>
<a name="l7601"><span class="ln">7601 </span></a><span class="s0">guide mine.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7602"><span class="ln">7602 </span></a>
<a name="l7603"><span class="ln">7603 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon</span>
<a name="l7604"><span class="ln">7604 </span></a><span class="s0">in them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7605"><span class="ln">7605 </span></a>
<a name="l7606"><span class="ln">7606 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Dixon.--Very well.  Yes, I immediately perceive that it must</span>
<a name="l7607"><span class="ln">7607 </span></a><span class="s0">be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.  We were speaking the</span>
<a name="l7608"><span class="ln">7608 </span></a><span class="s0">other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7609"><span class="ln">7609 </span></a>
<a name="l7610"><span class="ln">7610 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I</span>
<a name="l7611"><span class="ln">7611 </span></a><span class="s0">had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good</span>
<a name="l7612"><span class="ln">7612 </span></a><span class="s0">intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help</span>
<a name="l7613"><span class="ln">7613 </span></a><span class="s0">suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend,</span>
<a name="l7614"><span class="ln">7614 </span></a><span class="s0">he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became</span>
<a name="l7615"><span class="ln">7615 </span></a><span class="s0">conscious of a little attachment on her side.  One might guess</span>
<a name="l7616"><span class="ln">7616 </span></a><span class="s0">twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure</span>
<a name="l7617"><span class="ln">7617 </span></a><span class="s0">there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury</span>
<a name="l7618"><span class="ln">7618 </span></a><span class="s0">instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland.  Here, she must be</span>
<a name="l7619"><span class="ln">7619 </span></a><span class="s0">leading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been</span>
<a name="l7620"><span class="ln">7620 </span></a><span class="s0">all enjoyment.  As to the pretence of trying her native air, I look</span>
<a name="l7621"><span class="ln">7621 </span></a><span class="s0">upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed;</span>
<a name="l7622"><span class="ln">7622 </span></a><span class="s0">but what can any body's native air do for them in the months</span>
<a name="l7623"><span class="ln">7623 </span></a><span class="s0">of January, February, and March?  Good fires and carriages would</span>
<a name="l7624"><span class="ln">7624 </span></a><span class="s0">be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I</span>
<a name="l7625"><span class="ln">7625 </span></a><span class="s0">dare say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,</span>
<a name="l7626"><span class="ln">7626 </span></a><span class="s0">though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly</span>
<a name="l7627"><span class="ln">7627 </span></a><span class="s0">tell you what they are.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7628"><span class="ln">7628 </span></a>
<a name="l7629"><span class="ln">7629 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability.</span>
<a name="l7630"><span class="ln">7630 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer</span>
<a name="l7631"><span class="ln">7631 </span></a><span class="s0">for being very decided.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7632"><span class="ln">7632 </span></a>
<a name="l7633"><span class="ln">7633 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And then, he saved her life.  Did you ever hear of that?--</span>
<a name="l7634"><span class="ln">7634 </span></a><span class="s0">A water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard.</span>
<a name="l7635"><span class="ln">7635 </span></a><span class="s0">He caught her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7636"><span class="ln">7636 </span></a>
<a name="l7637"><span class="ln">7637 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He did.  I was there--one of the party.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7638"><span class="ln">7638 </span></a>
<a name="l7639"><span class="ln">7639 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course,</span>
<a name="l7640"><span class="ln">7640 </span></a><span class="s0">for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think</span>
<a name="l7641"><span class="ln">7641 </span></a><span class="s0">I should have made some discoveries.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7642"><span class="ln">7642 </span></a>
<a name="l7643"><span class="ln">7643 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact,</span>
<a name="l7644"><span class="ln">7644 </span></a><span class="s0">that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon</span>
<a name="l7645"><span class="ln">7645 </span></a><span class="s0">caught her.--It was the work of a moment.  And though the consequent</span>
<a name="l7646"><span class="ln">7646 </span></a><span class="s0">shock and alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I</span>
<a name="l7647"><span class="ln">7647 </span></a><span class="s0">believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--</span>
<a name="l7648"><span class="ln">7648 </span></a><span class="s0">yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar</span>
<a name="l7649"><span class="ln">7649 </span></a><span class="s0">anxiety to be observable.  I do not mean to say, however, that you</span>
<a name="l7650"><span class="ln">7650 </span></a><span class="s0">might not have made discoveries.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7651"><span class="ln">7651 </span></a>
<a name="l7652"><span class="ln">7652 </span></a><span class="s0">The conversation was here interrupted.  They were called on to share</span>
<a name="l7653"><span class="ln">7653 </span></a><span class="s0">in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses,</span>
<a name="l7654"><span class="ln">7654 </span></a><span class="s0">and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when</span>
<a name="l7655"><span class="ln">7655 </span></a><span class="s0">the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed</span>
<a name="l7656"><span class="ln">7656 </span></a><span class="s0">exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored,</span>
<a name="l7657"><span class="ln">7657 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma said,</span>
<a name="l7658"><span class="ln">7658 </span></a>
<a name="l7659"><span class="ln">7659 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me.  I wanted to know</span>
<a name="l7660"><span class="ln">7660 </span></a><span class="s0">a little more, and this tells me quite enough.  Depend upon it,</span>
<a name="l7661"><span class="ln">7661 </span></a><span class="s0">we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7662"><span class="ln">7662 </span></a>
<a name="l7663"><span class="ln">7663 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we</span>
<a name="l7664"><span class="ln">7664 </span></a><span class="s0">must conclude it to come from the Campbells.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7665"><span class="ln">7665 </span></a>
<a name="l7666"><span class="ln">7666 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells.  Miss Fairfax knows it</span>
<a name="l7667"><span class="ln">7667 </span></a><span class="s0">is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first.</span>
<a name="l7668"><span class="ln">7668 </span></a><span class="s0">She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them.</span>
<a name="l7669"><span class="ln">7669 </span></a><span class="s0">I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced</span>
<a name="l7670"><span class="ln">7670 </span></a><span class="s0">myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7671"><span class="ln">7671 </span></a>
<a name="l7672"><span class="ln">7672 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced.  Your reasonings</span>
<a name="l7673"><span class="ln">7673 </span></a><span class="s0">carry my judgment along with them entirely.  At first, while I</span>
<a name="l7674"><span class="ln">7674 </span></a><span class="s0">supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw</span>
<a name="l7675"><span class="ln">7675 </span></a><span class="s0">it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing</span>
<a name="l7676"><span class="ln">7676 </span></a><span class="s0">in the world.  But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more</span>
<a name="l7677"><span class="ln">7677 </span></a><span class="s0">probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship.</span>
<a name="l7678"><span class="ln">7678 </span></a><span class="s0">And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7679"><span class="ln">7679 </span></a>
<a name="l7680"><span class="ln">7680 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no occasion to press the matter farther.  The conviction</span>
<a name="l7681"><span class="ln">7681 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed real; he looked as if he felt it.  She said no more,</span>
<a name="l7682"><span class="ln">7682 </span></a><span class="s0">other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away;</span>
<a name="l7683"><span class="ln">7683 </span></a><span class="s0">the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked</span>
<a name="l7684"><span class="ln">7684 </span></a><span class="s0">to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever</span>
<a name="l7685"><span class="ln">7685 </span></a><span class="s0">things said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion</span>
<a name="l7686"><span class="ln">7686 </span></a><span class="s0">neither the one nor the other--nothing worse than everyday remarks,</span>
<a name="l7687"><span class="ln">7687 </span></a><span class="s0">dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.</span>
<a name="l7688"><span class="ln">7688 </span></a>
<a name="l7689"><span class="ln">7689 </span></a><span class="s0">The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies,</span>
<a name="l7690"><span class="ln">7690 </span></a><span class="s0">in their different divisions, arrived.  Emma watched the entree of her</span>
<a name="l7691"><span class="ln">7691 </span></a><span class="s0">own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity</span>
<a name="l7692"><span class="ln">7692 </span></a><span class="s0">and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the</span>
<a name="l7693"><span class="ln">7693 </span></a><span class="s0">artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful,</span>
<a name="l7694"><span class="ln">7694 </span></a><span class="s0">unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations</span>
<a name="l7695"><span class="ln">7695 </span></a><span class="s0">of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection.</span>
<a name="l7696"><span class="ln">7696 </span></a><span class="s0">There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she had</span>
<a name="l7697"><span class="ln">7697 </span></a><span class="s0">been lately shedding?  To be in company, nicely dressed herself</span>
<a name="l7698"><span class="ln">7698 </span></a><span class="s0">and seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty,</span>
<a name="l7699"><span class="ln">7699 </span></a><span class="s0">and say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour.</span>
<a name="l7700"><span class="ln">7700 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she</span>
<a name="l7701"><span class="ln">7701 </span></a><span class="s0">might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad</span>
<a name="l7702"><span class="ln">7702 </span></a><span class="s0">to have purchased the mortification of having loved--yes, of having</span>
<a name="l7703"><span class="ln">7703 </span></a><span class="s0">loved even Mr. Elton in vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous</span>
<a name="l7704"><span class="ln">7704 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend.</span>
<a name="l7705"><span class="ln">7705 </span></a>
<a name="l7706"><span class="ln">7706 </span></a><span class="s0">In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.</span>
<a name="l7707"><span class="ln">7707 </span></a><span class="s0">She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much</span>
<a name="l7708"><span class="ln">7708 </span></a><span class="s0">in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity</span>
<a name="l7709"><span class="ln">7709 </span></a><span class="s0">or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance;</span>
<a name="l7710"><span class="ln">7710 </span></a><span class="s0">but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced,</span>
<a name="l7711"><span class="ln">7711 </span></a><span class="s0">and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations</span>
<a name="l7712"><span class="ln">7712 </span></a><span class="s0">were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of &quot;my</span>
<a name="l7713"><span class="ln">7713 </span></a><span class="s0">excellent friend Colonel Campbell.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7714"><span class="ln">7714 </span></a>
<a name="l7715"><span class="ln">7715 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested</span>
<a name="l7716"><span class="ln">7716 </span></a><span class="s0">by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her</span>
<a name="l7717"><span class="ln">7717 </span></a><span class="s0">perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask</span>
<a name="l7718"><span class="ln">7718 </span></a><span class="s0">and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious</span>
<a name="l7719"><span class="ln">7719 </span></a><span class="s0">of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she</span>
<a name="l7720"><span class="ln">7720 </span></a><span class="s0">plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance.</span>
<a name="l7721"><span class="ln">7721 </span></a>
<a name="l7722"><span class="ln">7722 </span></a><span class="s0">They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the</span>
<a name="l7723"><span class="ln">7723 </span></a><span class="s0">early was Frank Churchill.  In he walked, the first and the handsomest;</span>
<a name="l7724"><span class="ln">7724 </span></a><span class="s0">and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and</span>
<a name="l7725"><span class="ln">7725 </span></a><span class="s0">her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,</span>
<a name="l7726"><span class="ln">7726 </span></a><span class="s0">where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,</span>
<a name="l7727"><span class="ln">7727 </span></a><span class="s0">would not sit at all.  Emma divined what every body present must</span>
<a name="l7728"><span class="ln">7728 </span></a><span class="s0">be thinking.  She was his object, and every body must perceive it.</span>
<a name="l7729"><span class="ln">7729 </span></a><span class="s0">She introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient</span>
<a name="l7730"><span class="ln">7730 </span></a><span class="s0">moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other.  &quot;He had</span>
<a name="l7731"><span class="ln">7731 </span></a><span class="s0">never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7732"><span class="ln">7732 </span></a><span class="s0">And she, &quot;Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment,</span>
<a name="l7733"><span class="ln">7733 </span></a><span class="s0">but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7734"><span class="ln">7734 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned from her in silence.</span>
<a name="l7735"><span class="ln">7735 </span></a>
<a name="l7736"><span class="ln">7736 </span></a><span class="s0">Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first</span>
<a name="l7737"><span class="ln">7737 </span></a><span class="s0">glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.</span>
<a name="l7738"><span class="ln">7738 </span></a><span class="s0">He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--</span>
<a name="l7739"><span class="ln">7739 </span></a><span class="s0">hated sitting long--was always the first to move when he could--</span>
<a name="l7740"><span class="ln">7740 </span></a><span class="s0">that his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left</span>
<a name="l7741"><span class="ln">7741 </span></a><span class="s0">very busy over parish business--that as long as he had staid,</span>
<a name="l7742"><span class="ln">7742 </span></a><span class="s0">however, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them in general</span>
<a name="l7743"><span class="ln">7743 </span></a><span class="s0">a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of</span>
<a name="l7744"><span class="ln">7744 </span></a><span class="s0">Highbury altogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families--</span>
<a name="l7745"><span class="ln">7745 </span></a><span class="s0">that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place</span>
<a name="l7746"><span class="ln">7746 </span></a><span class="s0">rather too much.  She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire--</span>
<a name="l7747"><span class="ln">7747 </span></a><span class="s0">the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort;</span>
<a name="l7748"><span class="ln">7748 </span></a><span class="s0">and could make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe</span>
<a name="l7749"><span class="ln">7749 </span></a><span class="s0">was concerned, there was very little going on, that their visitings</span>
<a name="l7750"><span class="ln">7750 </span></a><span class="s0">were among a range of great families, none very near; and that even</span>
<a name="l7751"><span class="ln">7751 </span></a><span class="s0">when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even</span>
<a name="l7752"><span class="ln">7752 </span></a><span class="s0">chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;</span>
<a name="l7753"><span class="ln">7753 </span></a><span class="s0">that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that,</span>
<a name="l7754"><span class="ln">7754 </span></a><span class="s0">though he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty,</span>
<a name="l7755"><span class="ln">7755 </span></a><span class="s0">without considerable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away,</span>
<a name="l7756"><span class="ln">7756 </span></a><span class="s0">or introduce an acquaintance for a night.</span>
<a name="l7757"><span class="ln">7757 </span></a>
<a name="l7758"><span class="ln">7758 </span></a><span class="s0">She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury,</span>
<a name="l7759"><span class="ln">7759 </span></a><span class="s0">taken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more</span>
<a name="l7760"><span class="ln">7760 </span></a><span class="s0">retirement at home than he liked.  His importance at Enscombe was</span>
<a name="l7761"><span class="ln">7761 </span></a><span class="s0">very evident.  He did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself,</span>
<a name="l7762"><span class="ln">7762 </span></a><span class="s0">that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing,</span>
<a name="l7763"><span class="ln">7763 </span></a><span class="s0">and on her laughing and noticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting</span>
<a name="l7764"><span class="ln">7764 </span></a><span class="s0">one or two points) he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing.</span>
<a name="l7765"><span class="ln">7765 </span></a><span class="s0">One of those points on which his influence failed, he then mentioned.</span>
<a name="l7766"><span class="ln">7766 </span></a><span class="s0">He had wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed</span>
<a name="l7767"><span class="ln">7767 </span></a><span class="s0">to be allowed to travel--but she would not hear of it.  This had</span>
<a name="l7768"><span class="ln">7768 </span></a><span class="s0">happened the year before.  _Now_, he said, he was beginning to have</span>
<a name="l7769"><span class="ln">7769 </span></a><span class="s0">no longer the same wish.</span>
<a name="l7770"><span class="ln">7770 </span></a>
<a name="l7771"><span class="ln">7771 </span></a><span class="s0">The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed</span>
<a name="l7772"><span class="ln">7772 </span></a><span class="s0">to be good behaviour to his father.</span>
<a name="l7773"><span class="ln">7773 </span></a>
<a name="l7774"><span class="ln">7774 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have made a most wretched discovery,&quot; said he, after a short pause.--</span>
<a name="l7775"><span class="ln">7775 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.  I never knew</span>
<a name="l7776"><span class="ln">7776 </span></a><span class="s0">days fly so fast.  A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to</span>
<a name="l7777"><span class="ln">7777 </span></a><span class="s0">enjoy myself.  But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--</span>
<a name="l7778"><span class="ln">7778 </span></a><span class="s0">I hate the recollection.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7779"><span class="ln">7779 </span></a>
<a name="l7780"><span class="ln">7780 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day,</span>
<a name="l7781"><span class="ln">7781 </span></a><span class="s0">out of so few, in having your hair cut.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7782"><span class="ln">7782 </span></a>
<a name="l7783"><span class="ln">7783 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot; said he, smiling, &quot;that is no subject of regret at all.</span>
<a name="l7784"><span class="ln">7784 </span></a><span class="s0">I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself</span>
<a name="l7785"><span class="ln">7785 </span></a><span class="s0">fit to be seen.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7786"><span class="ln">7786 </span></a>
<a name="l7787"><span class="ln">7787 </span></a><span class="s0">The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself</span>
<a name="l7788"><span class="ln">7788 </span></a><span class="s0">obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.</span>
<a name="l7789"><span class="ln">7789 </span></a><span class="s0">When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored</span>
<a name="l7790"><span class="ln">7790 </span></a><span class="s0">as before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room</span>
<a name="l7791"><span class="ln">7791 </span></a><span class="s0">at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.</span>
<a name="l7792"><span class="ln">7792 </span></a>
<a name="l7793"><span class="ln">7793 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What is the matter?&quot; said she.</span>
<a name="l7794"><span class="ln">7794 </span></a>
<a name="l7795"><span class="ln">7795 </span></a><span class="s0">He started.  &quot;Thank you for rousing me,&quot; he replied.  &quot;I believe</span>
<a name="l7796"><span class="ln">7796 </span></a><span class="s0">I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair</span>
<a name="l7797"><span class="ln">7797 </span></a><span class="s0">in so odd a way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes</span>
<a name="l7798"><span class="ln">7798 </span></a><span class="s0">from her.  I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must</span>
<a name="l7799"><span class="ln">7799 </span></a><span class="s0">be a fancy of her own.  I see nobody else looking like her!--</span>
<a name="l7800"><span class="ln">7800 </span></a><span class="s0">I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion.  Shall I?--</span>
<a name="l7801"><span class="ln">7801 </span></a><span class="s0">Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you shall see how she takes it;--</span>
<a name="l7802"><span class="ln">7802 </span></a><span class="s0">whether she colours.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7803"><span class="ln">7803 </span></a>
<a name="l7804"><span class="ln">7804 </span></a><span class="s0">He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss</span>
<a name="l7805"><span class="ln">7805 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,</span>
<a name="l7806"><span class="ln">7806 </span></a><span class="s0">as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly</span>
<a name="l7807"><span class="ln">7807 </span></a><span class="s0">in front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.</span>
<a name="l7808"><span class="ln">7808 </span></a>
<a name="l7809"><span class="ln">7809 </span></a><span class="s0">Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.</span>
<a name="l7810"><span class="ln">7810 </span></a>
<a name="l7811"><span class="ln">7811 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This is the luxury of a large party,&quot; said she:--&quot;one can get</span>
<a name="l7812"><span class="ln">7812 </span></a><span class="s0">near every body, and say every thing.  My dear Emma, I am longing</span>
<a name="l7813"><span class="ln">7813 </span></a><span class="s0">to talk to you.  I have been making discoveries and forming plans,</span>
<a name="l7814"><span class="ln">7814 </span></a><span class="s0">just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.</span>
<a name="l7815"><span class="ln">7815 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7816"><span class="ln">7816 </span></a>
<a name="l7817"><span class="ln">7817 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How?--They were invited, were not they?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7818"><span class="ln">7818 </span></a>
<a name="l7819"><span class="ln">7819 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7820"><span class="ln">7820 </span></a>
<a name="l7821"><span class="ln">7821 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;They walked, I conclude.  How else could they come?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7822"><span class="ln">7822 </span></a>
<a name="l7823"><span class="ln">7823 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad</span>
<a name="l7824"><span class="ln">7824 </span></a><span class="s0">it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night,</span>
<a name="l7825"><span class="ln">7825 </span></a><span class="s0">and cold as the nights are now.  And as I looked at her, though I</span>
<a name="l7826"><span class="ln">7826 </span></a><span class="s0">never saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she</span>
<a name="l7827"><span class="ln">7827 </span></a><span class="s0">was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold.</span>
<a name="l7828"><span class="ln">7828 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor girl!  I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston</span>
<a name="l7829"><span class="ln">7829 </span></a><span class="s0">came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about</span>
<a name="l7830"><span class="ln">7830 </span></a><span class="s0">the carriage.  You may guess how readily he came into my wishes;</span>
<a name="l7831"><span class="ln">7831 </span></a><span class="s0">and having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates,</span>
<a name="l7832"><span class="ln">7832 </span></a><span class="s0">to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took</span>
<a name="l7833"><span class="ln">7833 </span></a><span class="s0">us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once.</span>
<a name="l7834"><span class="ln">7834 </span></a><span class="s0">Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure.</span>
<a name="l7835"><span class="ln">7835 </span></a><span class="s0">`Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,</span>
<a name="l7836"><span class="ln">7836 </span></a><span class="s0">many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's</span>
<a name="l7837"><span class="ln">7837 </span></a><span class="s0">carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.'  I was</span>
<a name="l7838"><span class="ln">7838 </span></a><span class="s0">quite surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized.</span>
<a name="l7839"><span class="ln">7839 </span></a><span class="s0">Such a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--</span>
<a name="l7840"><span class="ln">7840 </span></a><span class="s0">the sort of thing that so few men would think of.  And, in short,</span>
<a name="l7841"><span class="ln">7841 </span></a><span class="s0">from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think</span>
<a name="l7842"><span class="ln">7842 </span></a><span class="s0">that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all.</span>
<a name="l7843"><span class="ln">7843 </span></a><span class="s0">I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself,</span>
<a name="l7844"><span class="ln">7844 </span></a><span class="s0">and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7845"><span class="ln">7845 </span></a>
<a name="l7846"><span class="ln">7846 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very likely,&quot; said Emma--&quot;nothing more likely.  I know no man</span>
<a name="l7847"><span class="ln">7847 </span></a><span class="s0">more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any</span>
<a name="l7848"><span class="ln">7848 </span></a><span class="s0">thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent.</span>
<a name="l7849"><span class="ln">7849 </span></a><span class="s0">He is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this,</span>
<a name="l7850"><span class="ln">7850 </span></a><span class="s0">considering Jane Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case</span>
<a name="l7851"><span class="ln">7851 </span></a><span class="s0">of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness,</span>
<a name="l7852"><span class="ln">7852 </span></a><span class="s0">there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l7853"><span class="ln">7853 </span></a><span class="s0">I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived together; and I laughed at</span>
<a name="l7854"><span class="ln">7854 </span></a><span class="s0">him about it, but he said not a word that could betray.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7855"><span class="ln">7855 </span></a>
<a name="l7856"><span class="ln">7856 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, smiling, &quot;you give him credit for</span>
<a name="l7857"><span class="ln">7857 </span></a><span class="s0">more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do;</span>
<a name="l7858"><span class="ln">7858 </span></a><span class="s0">for while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head,</span>
<a name="l7859"><span class="ln">7859 </span></a><span class="s0">and I have never been able to get it out again.  The more I think</span>
<a name="l7860"><span class="ln">7860 </span></a><span class="s0">of it, the more probable it appears.  In short, I have made a match</span>
<a name="l7861"><span class="ln">7861 </span></a><span class="s0">between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax.  See the consequence</span>
<a name="l7862"><span class="ln">7862 </span></a><span class="s0">of keeping you company!--What do you say to it?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7863"><span class="ln">7863 </span></a>
<a name="l7864"><span class="ln">7864 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!&quot; exclaimed Emma.  &quot;Dear Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l7865"><span class="ln">7865 </span></a><span class="s0">how could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l7866"><span class="ln">7866 </span></a><span class="s0">must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--</span>
<a name="l7867"><span class="ln">7867 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell.  I cannot at all consent to</span>
<a name="l7868"><span class="ln">7868 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely.</span>
<a name="l7869"><span class="ln">7869 </span></a><span class="s0">I am amazed that you should think of such a thing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7870"><span class="ln">7870 </span></a>
<a name="l7871"><span class="ln">7871 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it.</span>
<a name="l7872"><span class="ln">7872 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not want the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--</span>
<a name="l7873"><span class="ln">7873 </span></a><span class="s0">but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l7874"><span class="ln">7874 </span></a><span class="s0">really wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's</span>
<a name="l7875"><span class="ln">7875 </span></a><span class="s0">account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?&quot;</span>
<a name="l7876"><span class="ln">7876 </span></a>
<a name="l7877"><span class="ln">7877 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I would.  I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--</span>
<a name="l7878"><span class="ln">7878 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I</span>
<a name="l7879"><span class="ln">7879 </span></a><span class="s0">cannot adopt it now.  And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!&quot;</span>
<a name="l7880"><span class="ln">7880 </span></a>
<a name="l7881"><span class="ln">7881 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you</span>
<a name="l7882"><span class="ln">7882 </span></a><span class="s0">very well know.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7883"><span class="ln">7883 </span></a>
<a name="l7884"><span class="ln">7884 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But the imprudence of such a match!&quot;</span>
<a name="l7885"><span class="ln">7885 </span></a>
<a name="l7886"><span class="ln">7886 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7887"><span class="ln">7887 </span></a>
<a name="l7888"><span class="ln">7888 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation</span>
<a name="l7889"><span class="ln">7889 </span></a><span class="s0">than what you mention.  His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you,</span>
<a name="l7890"><span class="ln">7890 </span></a><span class="s0">would be quite enough to account for the horses.  He has a great</span>
<a name="l7891"><span class="ln">7891 </span></a><span class="s0">regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--</span>
<a name="l7892"><span class="ln">7892 </span></a><span class="s0">and is always glad to shew them attention.  My dear Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l7893"><span class="ln">7893 </span></a><span class="s0">do not take to match-making.  You do it very ill.  Jane Fairfax mistress</span>
<a name="l7894"><span class="ln">7894 </span></a><span class="s0">of the Abbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts.  For his own sake,</span>
<a name="l7895"><span class="ln">7895 </span></a><span class="s0">I would not have him do so mad a thing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7896"><span class="ln">7896 </span></a>
<a name="l7897"><span class="ln">7897 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Imprudent, if you please--but not mad.  Excepting inequality of fortune,</span>
<a name="l7898"><span class="ln">7898 </span></a><span class="s0">and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7899"><span class="ln">7899 </span></a>
<a name="l7900"><span class="ln">7900 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry.  I am sure he has not the</span>
<a name="l7901"><span class="ln">7901 </span></a><span class="s0">least idea of it.  Do not put it into his head.  Why should he marry?--</span>
<a name="l7902"><span class="ln">7902 </span></a><span class="s0">He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep,</span>
<a name="l7903"><span class="ln">7903 </span></a><span class="s0">and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely</span>
<a name="l7904"><span class="ln">7904 </span></a><span class="s0">fond of his brother's children.  He has no occasion to marry,</span>
<a name="l7905"><span class="ln">7905 </span></a><span class="s0">either to fill up his time or his heart.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7906"><span class="ln">7906 </span></a>
<a name="l7907"><span class="ln">7907 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really</span>
<a name="l7908"><span class="ln">7908 </span></a><span class="s0">loves Jane Fairfax--&quot;</span>
<a name="l7909"><span class="ln">7909 </span></a>
<a name="l7910"><span class="ln">7910 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nonsense!  He does not care about Jane Fairfax.  In the way</span>
<a name="l7911"><span class="ln">7911 </span></a><span class="s0">of love, I am sure he does not.  He would do any good to her,</span>
<a name="l7912"><span class="ln">7912 </span></a><span class="s0">or her family; but--&quot;</span>
<a name="l7913"><span class="ln">7913 </span></a>
<a name="l7914"><span class="ln">7914 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, laughing, &quot;perhaps the greatest good he</span>
<a name="l7915"><span class="ln">7915 </span></a><span class="s0">could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7916"><span class="ln">7916 </span></a>
<a name="l7917"><span class="ln">7917 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself;</span>
<a name="l7918"><span class="ln">7918 </span></a><span class="s0">a very shameful and degrading connexion.  How would he bear to have</span>
<a name="l7919"><span class="ln">7919 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey,</span>
<a name="l7920"><span class="ln">7920 </span></a><span class="s0">and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--</span>
<a name="l7921"><span class="ln">7921 </span></a><span class="s0">`So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very</span>
<a name="l7922"><span class="ln">7922 </span></a><span class="s0">kind neighbour!'  And then fly off, through half a sentence,</span>
<a name="l7923"><span class="ln">7923 </span></a><span class="s0">to her mother's old petticoat.  `Not that it was such a very old</span>
<a name="l7924"><span class="ln">7924 </span></a><span class="s0">petticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed,</span>
<a name="l7925"><span class="ln">7925 </span></a><span class="s0">she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'&quot;</span>
<a name="l7926"><span class="ln">7926 </span></a>
<a name="l7927"><span class="ln">7927 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;For shame, Emma!  Do not mimic her.  You divert me against</span>
<a name="l7928"><span class="ln">7928 </span></a><span class="s0">my conscience.  And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would</span>
<a name="l7929"><span class="ln">7929 </span></a><span class="s0">be much disturbed by Miss Bates.  Little things do not irritate him.</span>
<a name="l7930"><span class="ln">7930 </span></a><span class="s0">She might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would</span>
<a name="l7931"><span class="ln">7931 </span></a><span class="s0">only talk louder, and drown her voice.  But the question is not,</span>
<a name="l7932"><span class="ln">7932 </span></a><span class="s0">whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it;</span>
<a name="l7933"><span class="ln">7933 </span></a><span class="s0">and I think he does.  I have heard him speak, and so must you,</span>
<a name="l7934"><span class="ln">7934 </span></a><span class="s0">so very highly of Jane Fairfax!  The interest he takes in her--</span>
<a name="l7935"><span class="ln">7935 </span></a><span class="s0">his anxiety about her health--his concern that she should have no</span>
<a name="l7936"><span class="ln">7936 </span></a><span class="s0">happier prospect!  I have heard him express himself so warmly on</span>
<a name="l7937"><span class="ln">7937 </span></a><span class="s0">those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte,</span>
<a name="l7938"><span class="ln">7938 </span></a><span class="s0">and of her voice!  I have heard him say that he could listen to her</span>
<a name="l7939"><span class="ln">7939 </span></a><span class="s0">for ever.  Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred</span>
<a name="l7940"><span class="ln">7940 </span></a><span class="s0">to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--</span>
<a name="l7941"><span class="ln">7941 </span></a><span class="s0">though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present</span>
<a name="l7942"><span class="ln">7942 </span></a><span class="s0">from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?  I cannot</span>
<a name="l7943"><span class="ln">7943 </span></a><span class="s0">help suspecting him.  I think he is just the person to do it,</span>
<a name="l7944"><span class="ln">7944 </span></a><span class="s0">even without being in love.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7945"><span class="ln">7945 </span></a>
<a name="l7946"><span class="ln">7946 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love.</span>
<a name="l7947"><span class="ln">7947 </span></a><span class="s0">But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do.</span>
<a name="l7948"><span class="ln">7948 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7949"><span class="ln">7949 </span></a>
<a name="l7950"><span class="ln">7950 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;</span>
<a name="l7951"><span class="ln">7951 </span></a><span class="s0">oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common</span>
<a name="l7952"><span class="ln">7952 </span></a><span class="s0">course of things, occur to him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7953"><span class="ln">7953 </span></a>
<a name="l7954"><span class="ln">7954 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have</span>
<a name="l7955"><span class="ln">7955 </span></a><span class="s0">told her so.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7956"><span class="ln">7956 </span></a>
<a name="l7957"><span class="ln">7957 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma.  I have a very</span>
<a name="l7958"><span class="ln">7958 </span></a><span class="s0">strong notion that it comes from him.  I am sure he was particularly</span>
<a name="l7959"><span class="ln">7959 </span></a><span class="s0">silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7960"><span class="ln">7960 </span></a>
<a name="l7961"><span class="ln">7961 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have</span>
<a name="l7962"><span class="ln">7962 </span></a><span class="s0">many a time reproached me with doing.  I see no sign of attachment--</span>
<a name="l7963"><span class="ln">7963 </span></a><span class="s0">I believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince</span>
<a name="l7964"><span class="ln">7964 </span></a><span class="s0">me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.&quot;</span>
<a name="l7965"><span class="ln">7965 </span></a>
<a name="l7966"><span class="ln">7966 </span></a><span class="s0">They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather</span>
<a name="l7967"><span class="ln">7967 </span></a><span class="s0">gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was</span>
<a name="l7968"><span class="ln">7968 </span></a><span class="s0">the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room</span>
<a name="l7969"><span class="ln">7969 </span></a><span class="s0">shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--</span>
<a name="l7970"><span class="ln">7970 </span></a><span class="s0">and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l7971"><span class="ln">7971 </span></a><span class="s0">would do them the honour of trying it.  Frank Churchill, of whom,</span>
<a name="l7972"><span class="ln">7972 </span></a><span class="s0">in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been</span>
<a name="l7973"><span class="ln">7973 </span></a><span class="s0">seeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax,</span>
<a name="l7974"><span class="ln">7974 </span></a><span class="s0">followed Mr. Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as,</span>
<a name="l7975"><span class="ln">7975 </span></a><span class="s0">in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very</span>
<a name="l7976"><span class="ln">7976 </span></a><span class="s0">proper compliance.</span>
<a name="l7977"><span class="ln">7977 </span></a>
<a name="l7978"><span class="ln">7978 </span></a><span class="s0">She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt</span>
<a name="l7979"><span class="ln">7979 </span></a><span class="s0">more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste</span>
<a name="l7980"><span class="ln">7980 </span></a><span class="s0">nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable,</span>
<a name="l7981"><span class="ln">7981 </span></a><span class="s0">and could accompany her own voice well.  One accompaniment to her song</span>
<a name="l7982"><span class="ln">7982 </span></a><span class="s0">took her agreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly</span>
<a name="l7983"><span class="ln">7983 </span></a><span class="s0">taken by Frank Churchill.  Her pardon was duly begged at the close</span>
<a name="l7984"><span class="ln">7984 </span></a><span class="s0">of the song, and every thing usual followed.  He was accused</span>
<a name="l7985"><span class="ln">7985 </span></a><span class="s0">of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music;</span>
<a name="l7986"><span class="ln">7986 </span></a><span class="s0">which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter,</span>
<a name="l7987"><span class="ln">7987 </span></a><span class="s0">and had no voice at all, roundly asserted.  They sang together</span>
<a name="l7988"><span class="ln">7988 </span></a><span class="s0">once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax,</span>
<a name="l7989"><span class="ln">7989 </span></a><span class="s0">whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could</span>
<a name="l7990"><span class="ln">7990 </span></a><span class="s0">attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.</span>
<a name="l7991"><span class="ln">7991 </span></a>
<a name="l7992"><span class="ln">7992 </span></a><span class="s0">With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the</span>
<a name="l7993"><span class="ln">7993 </span></a><span class="s0">numbers round the instrument, to listen.  Frank Churchill sang again.</span>
<a name="l7994"><span class="ln">7994 </span></a><span class="s0">They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth.</span>
<a name="l7995"><span class="ln">7995 </span></a><span class="s0">But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew</span>
<a name="l7996"><span class="ln">7996 </span></a><span class="s0">away half Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking</span>
<a name="l7997"><span class="ln">7997 </span></a><span class="s0">on the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet</span>
<a name="l7998"><span class="ln">7998 </span></a><span class="s0">sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions.</span>
<a name="l7999"><span class="ln">7999 </span></a><span class="s0">Her objections to Mr. Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside.</span>
<a name="l8000"><span class="ln">8000 </span></a><span class="s0">She could see nothing but evil in it.  It would be a great</span>
<a name="l8001"><span class="ln">8001 </span></a><span class="s0">disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella.</span>
<a name="l8002"><span class="ln">8002 </span></a><span class="s0">A real injury to the children--a most mortifying change,</span>
<a name="l8003"><span class="ln">8003 </span></a><span class="s0">and material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her</span>
<a name="l8004"><span class="ln">8004 </span></a><span class="s0">father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could not at all</span>
<a name="l8005"><span class="ln">8005 </span></a><span class="s0">endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey.  A Mrs. Knightley</span>
<a name="l8006"><span class="ln">8006 </span></a><span class="s0">for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never marry.</span>
<a name="l8007"><span class="ln">8007 </span></a><span class="s0">Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.</span>
<a name="l8008"><span class="ln">8008 </span></a>
<a name="l8009"><span class="ln">8009 </span></a><span class="s0">Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her.</span>
<a name="l8010"><span class="ln">8010 </span></a><span class="s0">They talked at first only of the performance.  His admiration</span>
<a name="l8011"><span class="ln">8011 </span></a><span class="s0">was certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l8012"><span class="ln">8012 </span></a><span class="s0">it would not have struck her.  As a sort of touchstone, however,</span>
<a name="l8013"><span class="ln">8013 </span></a><span class="s0">she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece;</span>
<a name="l8014"><span class="ln">8014 </span></a><span class="s0">and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short,</span>
<a name="l8015"><span class="ln">8015 </span></a><span class="s0">she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any</span>
<a name="l8016"><span class="ln">8016 </span></a><span class="s0">kindness of his own.</span>
<a name="l8017"><span class="ln">8017 </span></a>
<a name="l8018"><span class="ln">8018 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I often feel concern,&quot; said she, &quot;that I dare not make our carriage</span>
<a name="l8019"><span class="ln">8019 </span></a><span class="s0">more useful on such occasions.  It is not that I am without the wish;</span>
<a name="l8020"><span class="ln">8020 </span></a><span class="s0">but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James</span>
<a name="l8021"><span class="ln">8021 </span></a><span class="s0">should put-to for such a purpose.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8022"><span class="ln">8022 </span></a>
<a name="l8023"><span class="ln">8023 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,&quot; he replied;--</span>
<a name="l8024"><span class="ln">8024 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;but you must often wish it, I am sure.&quot;  And he smiled with such</span>
<a name="l8025"><span class="ln">8025 </span></a><span class="s0">seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step.</span>
<a name="l8026"><span class="ln">8026 </span></a>
<a name="l8027"><span class="ln">8027 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This present from the Campbells,&quot; said she--&quot;this pianoforte</span>
<a name="l8028"><span class="ln">8028 </span></a><span class="s0">is very kindly given.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8029"><span class="ln">8029 </span></a>
<a name="l8030"><span class="ln">8030 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.--</span>
<a name="l8031"><span class="ln">8031 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But they would have done better had they given her notice of it.</span>
<a name="l8032"><span class="ln">8032 </span></a><span class="s0">Surprizes are foolish things.  The pleasure is not enhanced, and the</span>
<a name="l8033"><span class="ln">8033 </span></a><span class="s0">inconvenience is often considerable.  I should have expected better</span>
<a name="l8034"><span class="ln">8034 </span></a><span class="s0">judgment in Colonel Campbell.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8035"><span class="ln">8035 </span></a>
<a name="l8036"><span class="ln">8036 </span></a><span class="s0">From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l8037"><span class="ln">8037 </span></a><span class="s0">had had no concern in giving the instrument.  But whether he</span>
<a name="l8038"><span class="ln">8038 </span></a><span class="s0">were entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there</span>
<a name="l8039"><span class="ln">8039 </span></a><span class="s0">were no actual preference--remained a little longer doubtful.</span>
<a name="l8040"><span class="ln">8040 </span></a><span class="s0">Towards the end of Jane's second song, her voice grew thick.</span>
<a name="l8041"><span class="ln">8041 </span></a>
<a name="l8042"><span class="ln">8042 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That will do,&quot; said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--</span>
<a name="l8043"><span class="ln">8043 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8044"><span class="ln">8044 </span></a>
<a name="l8045"><span class="ln">8045 </span></a><span class="s0">Another song, however, was soon begged for.  &quot;One more;--they would</span>
<a name="l8046"><span class="ln">8046 </span></a><span class="s0">not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for</span>
<a name="l8047"><span class="ln">8047 </span></a><span class="s0">one more.&quot;  And Frank Churchill was heard to say, &quot;I think you could</span>
<a name="l8048"><span class="ln">8048 </span></a><span class="s0">manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling.</span>
<a name="l8049"><span class="ln">8049 </span></a><span class="s0">The strength of the song falls on the second.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8050"><span class="ln">8050 </span></a>
<a name="l8051"><span class="ln">8051 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley grew angry.</span>
<a name="l8052"><span class="ln">8052 </span></a>
<a name="l8053"><span class="ln">8053 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That fellow,&quot; said he, indignantly, &quot;thinks of nothing but shewing</span>
<a name="l8054"><span class="ln">8054 </span></a><span class="s0">off his own voice.  This must not be.&quot;  And touching Miss Bates,</span>
<a name="l8055"><span class="ln">8055 </span></a><span class="s0">who at that moment passed near--&quot;Miss Bates, are you mad, to let</span>
<a name="l8056"><span class="ln">8056 </span></a><span class="s0">your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner?  Go, and interfere.</span>
<a name="l8057"><span class="ln">8057 </span></a><span class="s0">They have no mercy on her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8058"><span class="ln">8058 </span></a>
<a name="l8059"><span class="ln">8059 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even</span>
<a name="l8060"><span class="ln">8060 </span></a><span class="s0">to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all</span>
<a name="l8061"><span class="ln">8061 </span></a><span class="s0">farther singing.  Here ceased the concert part of the evening,</span>
<a name="l8062"><span class="ln">8062 </span></a><span class="s0">for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers;</span>
<a name="l8063"><span class="ln">8063 </span></a><span class="s0">but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing--</span>
<a name="l8064"><span class="ln">8064 </span></a><span class="s0">originating nobody exactly knew where--was so effectually promoted</span>
<a name="l8065"><span class="ln">8065 </span></a><span class="s0">by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away,</span>
<a name="l8066"><span class="ln">8066 </span></a><span class="s0">to give proper space.  Mrs. Weston, capital in her country-dances,</span>
<a name="l8067"><span class="ln">8067 </span></a><span class="s0">was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill,</span>
<a name="l8068"><span class="ln">8068 </span></a><span class="s0">coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand,</span>
<a name="l8069"><span class="ln">8069 </span></a><span class="s0">and led her up to the top.</span>
<a name="l8070"><span class="ln">8070 </span></a>
<a name="l8071"><span class="ln">8071 </span></a><span class="s0">While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,</span>
<a name="l8072"><span class="ln">8072 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her</span>
<a name="l8073"><span class="ln">8073 </span></a><span class="s0">voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l8074"><span class="ln">8074 </span></a><span class="s0">This would be a trial.  He was no dancer in general.  If he were to be</span>
<a name="l8075"><span class="ln">8075 </span></a><span class="s0">very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something.</span>
<a name="l8076"><span class="ln">8076 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no immediate appearance.  No; he was talking to Mrs. Cole--</span>
<a name="l8077"><span class="ln">8077 </span></a><span class="s0">he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,</span>
<a name="l8078"><span class="ln">8078 </span></a><span class="s0">and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.</span>
<a name="l8079"><span class="ln">8079 </span></a>
<a name="l8080"><span class="ln">8080 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe;</span>
<a name="l8081"><span class="ln">8081 </span></a><span class="s0">and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.</span>
<a name="l8082"><span class="ln">8082 </span></a><span class="s0">Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the</span>
<a name="l8083"><span class="ln">8083 </span></a><span class="s0">suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself well</span>
<a name="l8084"><span class="ln">8084 </span></a><span class="s0">matched in a partner.  They were a couple worth looking at.</span>
<a name="l8085"><span class="ln">8085 </span></a>
<a name="l8086"><span class="ln">8086 </span></a><span class="s0">Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed.</span>
<a name="l8087"><span class="ln">8087 </span></a><span class="s0">It was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home,</span>
<a name="l8088"><span class="ln">8088 </span></a><span class="s0">on her mother's account.  After some attempts, therefore, to be</span>
<a name="l8089"><span class="ln">8089 </span></a><span class="s0">permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l8090"><span class="ln">8090 </span></a><span class="s0">look sorrowful, and have done.</span>
<a name="l8091"><span class="ln">8091 </span></a>
<a name="l8092"><span class="ln">8092 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Perhaps it is as well,&quot; said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma</span>
<a name="l8093"><span class="ln">8093 </span></a><span class="s0">to her carriage.  &quot;I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid</span>
<a name="l8094"><span class="ln">8094 </span></a><span class="s0">dancing would not have agreed with me, after your's.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8095"><span class="ln">8095 </span></a>
<a name="l8096"><span class="ln">8096 </span></a>
<a name="l8097"><span class="ln">8097 </span></a>
<a name="l8098"><span class="ln">8098 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>
<a name="l8099"><span class="ln">8099 </span></a>
<a name="l8100"><span class="ln">8100 </span></a>
<a name="l8101"><span class="ln">8101 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles.</span>
<a name="l8102"><span class="ln">8102 </span></a><span class="s0">The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day;</span>
<a name="l8103"><span class="ln">8103 </span></a><span class="s0">and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side</span>
<a name="l8104"><span class="ln">8104 </span></a><span class="s0">of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour</span>
<a name="l8105"><span class="ln">8105 </span></a><span class="s0">of popularity.  She must have delighted the Coles--worthy people,</span>
<a name="l8106"><span class="ln">8106 </span></a><span class="s0">who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would</span>
<a name="l8107"><span class="ln">8107 </span></a><span class="s0">not soon die away.</span>
<a name="l8108"><span class="ln">8108 </span></a>
<a name="l8109"><span class="ln">8109 </span></a><span class="s0">Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were</span>
<a name="l8110"><span class="ln">8110 </span></a><span class="s0">two points on which she was not quite easy.  She doubted whether</span>
<a name="l8111"><span class="ln">8111 </span></a><span class="s0">she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying</span>
<a name="l8112"><span class="ln">8112 </span></a><span class="s0">her suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill.</span>
<a name="l8113"><span class="ln">8113 </span></a><span class="s0">It was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it</span>
<a name="l8114"><span class="ln">8114 </span></a><span class="s0">would escape her, and his submission to all that she told,</span>
<a name="l8115"><span class="ln">8115 </span></a><span class="s0">was a compliment to her penetration, which made it difficult</span>
<a name="l8116"><span class="ln">8116 </span></a><span class="s0">for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue.</span>
<a name="l8117"><span class="ln">8117 </span></a>
<a name="l8118"><span class="ln">8118 </span></a><span class="s0">The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax;</span>
<a name="l8119"><span class="ln">8119 </span></a><span class="s0">and there she had no doubt.  She did unfeignedly and unequivocally</span>
<a name="l8120"><span class="ln">8120 </span></a><span class="s0">regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing.  She did</span>
<a name="l8121"><span class="ln">8121 </span></a><span class="s0">most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat</span>
<a name="l8122"><span class="ln">8122 </span></a><span class="s0">down and practised vigorously an hour and a half.</span>
<a name="l8123"><span class="ln">8123 </span></a>
<a name="l8124"><span class="ln">8124 </span></a><span class="s0">She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's</span>
<a name="l8125"><span class="ln">8125 </span></a><span class="s0">praise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.</span>
<a name="l8126"><span class="ln">8126 </span></a>
<a name="l8127"><span class="ln">8127 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!&quot;</span>
<a name="l8128"><span class="ln">8128 </span></a>
<a name="l8129"><span class="ln">8129 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Don't class us together, Harriet.  My playing is no more like</span>
<a name="l8130"><span class="ln">8130 </span></a><span class="s0">her's, than a lamp is like sunshine.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8131"><span class="ln">8131 </span></a>
<a name="l8132"><span class="ln">8132 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two.  I think you play</span>
<a name="l8133"><span class="ln">8133 </span></a><span class="s0">quite as well as she does.  I am sure I had much rather hear you.</span>
<a name="l8134"><span class="ln">8134 </span></a><span class="s0">Every body last night said how well you played.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8135"><span class="ln">8135 </span></a>
<a name="l8136"><span class="ln">8136 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.</span>
<a name="l8137"><span class="ln">8137 </span></a><span class="s0">The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,</span>
<a name="l8138"><span class="ln">8138 </span></a><span class="s0">but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8139"><span class="ln">8139 </span></a>
<a name="l8140"><span class="ln">8140 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does,</span>
<a name="l8141"><span class="ln">8141 </span></a><span class="s0">or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out.</span>
<a name="l8142"><span class="ln">8142 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked</span>
<a name="l8143"><span class="ln">8143 </span></a><span class="s0">a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more</span>
<a name="l8144"><span class="ln">8144 </span></a><span class="s0">than execution.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8145"><span class="ln">8145 </span></a>
<a name="l8146"><span class="ln">8146 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8147"><span class="ln">8147 </span></a>
<a name="l8148"><span class="ln">8148 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Are you sure?  I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had</span>
<a name="l8149"><span class="ln">8149 </span></a><span class="s0">any taste.  Nobody talked about it.  And I hate Italian singing.--</span>
<a name="l8150"><span class="ln">8150 </span></a><span class="s0">There is no understanding a word of it.  Besides, if she does play</span>
<a name="l8151"><span class="ln">8151 </span></a><span class="s0">so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do,</span>
<a name="l8152"><span class="ln">8152 </span></a><span class="s0">because she will have to teach.  The Coxes were wondering last night</span>
<a name="l8153"><span class="ln">8153 </span></a><span class="s0">whether she would get into any great family.  How did you think the</span>
<a name="l8154"><span class="ln">8154 </span></a><span class="s0">Coxes looked?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8155"><span class="ln">8155 </span></a>
<a name="l8156"><span class="ln">8156 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Just as they always do--very vulgar.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8157"><span class="ln">8157 </span></a>
<a name="l8158"><span class="ln">8158 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;They told me something,&quot; said Harriet rather hesitatingly;&quot;</span>
<a name="l8159"><span class="ln">8159 </span></a><span class="s0">but it is nothing of any consequence.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8160"><span class="ln">8160 </span></a>
<a name="l8161"><span class="ln">8161 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful</span>
<a name="l8162"><span class="ln">8162 </span></a><span class="s0">of its producing Mr. Elton.</span>
<a name="l8163"><span class="ln">8163 </span></a>
<a name="l8164"><span class="ln">8164 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8165"><span class="ln">8165 </span></a>
<a name="l8166"><span class="ln">8166 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!&quot;</span>
<a name="l8167"><span class="ln">8167 </span></a>
<a name="l8168"><span class="ln">8168 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him</span>
<a name="l8169"><span class="ln">8169 </span></a><span class="s0">to stay to dinner.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8170"><span class="ln">8170 </span></a>
<a name="l8171"><span class="ln">8171 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!&quot;</span>
<a name="l8172"><span class="ln">8172 </span></a>
<a name="l8173"><span class="ln">8173 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox.</span>
<a name="l8174"><span class="ln">8174 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not know what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I</span>
<a name="l8175"><span class="ln">8175 </span></a><span class="s0">should go and stay there again next summer.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8176"><span class="ln">8176 </span></a>
<a name="l8177"><span class="ln">8177 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox</span>
<a name="l8178"><span class="ln">8178 </span></a><span class="s0">should be.&quot;</span>

<a name="l8180"><span class="ln">8180 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there.  He sat</span>
<a name="l8181"><span class="ln">8181 </span></a><span class="s0">by her at dinner.  Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would</span>
<a name="l8182"><span class="ln">8182 </span></a><span class="s0">be very glad to marry him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8183"><span class="ln">8183 </span></a>
<a name="l8184"><span class="ln">8184 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar</span>
<a name="l8185"><span class="ln">8185 </span></a><span class="s0">girls in Highbury.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8186"><span class="ln">8186 </span></a>
<a name="l8187"><span class="ln">8187 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go</span>
<a name="l8188"><span class="ln">8188 </span></a><span class="s0">with her.  Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible,</span>
<a name="l8189"><span class="ln">8189 </span></a><span class="s0">and in her present state, would be dangerous.</span>
<a name="l8190"><span class="ln">8190 </span></a>
<a name="l8191"><span class="ln">8191 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always</span>
<a name="l8192"><span class="ln">8192 </span></a><span class="s0">very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins</span>
<a name="l8193"><span class="ln">8193 </span></a><span class="s0">and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could</span>
<a name="l8194"><span class="ln">8194 </span></a><span class="s0">not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--</span>
<a name="l8195"><span class="ln">8195 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at</span>
<a name="l8196"><span class="ln">8196 </span></a><span class="s0">the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise,</span>
<a name="l8197"><span class="ln">8197 </span></a><span class="s0">or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest</span>
<a name="l8198"><span class="ln">8198 </span></a><span class="s0">objects she could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on</span>
<a name="l8199"><span class="ln">8199 </span></a><span class="s0">the butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from</span>
<a name="l8200"><span class="ln">8200 </span></a><span class="s0">shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone,</span>
<a name="l8201"><span class="ln">8201 </span></a><span class="s0">and a string of dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window</span>
<a name="l8202"><span class="ln">8202 </span></a><span class="s0">eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain,</span>
<a name="l8203"><span class="ln">8203 </span></a><span class="s0">and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door.</span>
<a name="l8204"><span class="ln">8204 </span></a><span class="s0">A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see</span>
<a name="l8205"><span class="ln">8205 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing that does not answer.</span>
<a name="l8206"><span class="ln">8206 </span></a>
<a name="l8207"><span class="ln">8207 </span></a><span class="s0">She looked down the Randalls road.  The scene enlarged;</span>
<a name="l8208"><span class="ln">8208 </span></a><span class="s0">two persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were</span>
<a name="l8209"><span class="ln">8209 </span></a><span class="s0">walking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course.  They were stopping,</span>
<a name="l8210"><span class="ln">8210 </span></a><span class="s0">however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was</span>
<a name="l8211"><span class="ln">8211 </span></a><span class="s0">a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked,</span>
<a name="l8212"><span class="ln">8212 </span></a><span class="s0">when Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road</span>
<a name="l8213"><span class="ln">8213 </span></a><span class="s0">and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday's</span>
<a name="l8214"><span class="ln">8214 </span></a><span class="s0">engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting.</span>
<a name="l8215"><span class="ln">8215 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses,</span>
<a name="l8216"><span class="ln">8216 </span></a><span class="s0">in order to hear the new instrument.</span>
<a name="l8217"><span class="ln">8217 </span></a>
<a name="l8218"><span class="ln">8218 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;For my companion tells me,&quot; said she, &quot;that I absolutely promised</span>
<a name="l8219"><span class="ln">8219 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning.  I was</span>
<a name="l8220"><span class="ln">8220 </span></a><span class="s0">not aware of it myself.  I did not know that I had fixed a day,</span>
<a name="l8221"><span class="ln">8221 </span></a><span class="s0">but as he says I did, I am going now.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8222"><span class="ln">8222 </span></a>
<a name="l8223"><span class="ln">8223 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,&quot;</span>
<a name="l8224"><span class="ln">8224 </span></a><span class="s0">said Frank Churchill, &quot;to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--</span>
<a name="l8225"><span class="ln">8225 </span></a><span class="s0">if you are going home.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8226"><span class="ln">8226 </span></a>
<a name="l8227"><span class="ln">8227 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston was disappointed.</span>
<a name="l8228"><span class="ln">8228 </span></a>
<a name="l8229"><span class="ln">8229 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I thought you meant to go with me.  They would be very much pleased.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8230"><span class="ln">8230 </span></a>
<a name="l8231"><span class="ln">8231 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Me!  I should be quite in the way.  But, perhaps--I may be equally</span>
<a name="l8232"><span class="ln">8232 </span></a><span class="s0">in the way here.  Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me.</span>
<a name="l8233"><span class="ln">8233 </span></a><span class="s0">My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping.  She says I fidget</span>
<a name="l8234"><span class="ln">8234 </span></a><span class="s0">her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say</span>
<a name="l8235"><span class="ln">8235 </span></a><span class="s0">the same.  What am I to do?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8236"><span class="ln">8236 </span></a>
<a name="l8237"><span class="ln">8237 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am here on no business of my own,&quot; said Emma; &quot;I am only waiting</span>
<a name="l8238"><span class="ln">8238 </span></a><span class="s0">for my friend.  She will probably have soon done, and then we</span>
<a name="l8239"><span class="ln">8239 </span></a><span class="s0">shall go home.  But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear</span>
<a name="l8240"><span class="ln">8240 </span></a><span class="s0">the instrument.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8241"><span class="ln">8241 </span></a>
<a name="l8242"><span class="ln">8242 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell</span>
<a name="l8243"><span class="ln">8243 </span></a><span class="s0">should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove</span>
<a name="l8244"><span class="ln">8244 </span></a><span class="s0">to have an indifferent tone--what shall I say?  I shall be no</span>
<a name="l8245"><span class="ln">8245 </span></a><span class="s0">support to Mrs. Weston.  She might do very well by herself.</span>
<a name="l8246"><span class="ln">8246 </span></a><span class="s0">A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but I</span>
<a name="l8247"><span class="ln">8247 </span></a><span class="s0">am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8248"><span class="ln">8248 </span></a>
<a name="l8249"><span class="ln">8249 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not believe any such thing,&quot; replied Emma.--&quot;I am persuaded</span>
<a name="l8250"><span class="ln">8250 </span></a><span class="s0">that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary;</span>
<a name="l8251"><span class="ln">8251 </span></a><span class="s0">but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent.</span>
<a name="l8252"><span class="ln">8252 </span></a><span class="s0">Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion</span>
<a name="l8253"><span class="ln">8253 </span></a><span class="s0">last night.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8254"><span class="ln">8254 </span></a>
<a name="l8255"><span class="ln">8255 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Do come with me,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, &quot;if it be not very disagreeable</span>
<a name="l8256"><span class="ln">8256 </span></a><span class="s0">to you.  It need not detain us long.  We will go to Hartfield afterwards.</span>
<a name="l8257"><span class="ln">8257 </span></a><span class="s0">We will follow them to Hartfield.  I really wish you to call with me.</span>
<a name="l8258"><span class="ln">8258 </span></a><span class="s0">It will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you</span>
<a name="l8259"><span class="ln">8259 </span></a><span class="s0">meant it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8260"><span class="ln">8260 </span></a>
<a name="l8261"><span class="ln">8261 </span></a><span class="s0">He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,</span>
<a name="l8262"><span class="ln">8262 </span></a><span class="s0">returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door.  Emma watched them in,</span>
<a name="l8263"><span class="ln">8263 </span></a><span class="s0">and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all</span>
<a name="l8264"><span class="ln">8264 </span></a><span class="s0">the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain</span>
<a name="l8265"><span class="ln">8265 </span></a><span class="s0">muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon,</span>
<a name="l8266"><span class="ln">8266 </span></a><span class="s0">be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern.</span>
<a name="l8267"><span class="ln">8267 </span></a><span class="s0">At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.</span>
<a name="l8268"><span class="ln">8268 </span></a>
<a name="l8269"><span class="ln">8269 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?&quot; asked Mrs. Ford.--</span>
<a name="l8270"><span class="ln">8270 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is</span>
<a name="l8271"><span class="ln">8271 </span></a><span class="s0">at Hartfield.  No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please.</span>
<a name="l8272"><span class="ln">8272 </span></a><span class="s0">But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the</span>
<a name="l8273"><span class="ln">8273 </span></a><span class="s0">pattern gown home any day.  But I shall want the ribbon directly--</span>
<a name="l8274"><span class="ln">8274 </span></a><span class="s0">so it had better go to Hartfield--at least the ribbon.  You could</span>
<a name="l8275"><span class="ln">8275 </span></a><span class="s0">make it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8276"><span class="ln">8276 </span></a>
<a name="l8277"><span class="ln">8277 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble</span>
<a name="l8278"><span class="ln">8278 </span></a><span class="s0">of two parcels.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8279"><span class="ln">8279 </span></a>
<a name="l8280"><span class="ln">8280 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No more it is.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8281"><span class="ln">8281 </span></a>
<a name="l8282"><span class="ln">8282 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No trouble in the world, ma'am,&quot; said the obliging Mrs. Ford.</span>
<a name="l8283"><span class="ln">8283 </span></a>
<a name="l8284"><span class="ln">8284 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one.</span>
<a name="l8285"><span class="ln">8285 </span></a><span class="s0">Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--</span>
<a name="l8286"><span class="ln">8286 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not know--No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well</span>
<a name="l8287"><span class="ln">8287 </span></a><span class="s0">have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night.</span>
<a name="l8288"><span class="ln">8288 </span></a><span class="s0">What do you advise?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8289"><span class="ln">8289 </span></a>
<a name="l8290"><span class="ln">8290 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That you do not give another half-second to the subject.</span>
<a name="l8291"><span class="ln">8291 </span></a><span class="s0">To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8292"><span class="ln">8292 </span></a>
<a name="l8293"><span class="ln">8293 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Aye, that will be much best,&quot; said Harriet, quite satisfied,</span>
<a name="l8294"><span class="ln">8294 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8295"><span class="ln">8295 </span></a>
<a name="l8296"><span class="ln">8296 </span></a><span class="s0">Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies:</span>
<a name="l8297"><span class="ln">8297 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.</span>
<a name="l8298"><span class="ln">8298 </span></a>
<a name="l8299"><span class="ln">8299 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Miss Woodhouse,&quot; said the latter, &quot;I am just run across to</span>
<a name="l8300"><span class="ln">8300 </span></a><span class="s0">entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,</span>
<a name="l8301"><span class="ln">8301 </span></a><span class="s0">and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith.</span>
<a name="l8302"><span class="ln">8302 </span></a><span class="s0">How do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged</span>
<a name="l8303"><span class="ln">8303 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8304"><span class="ln">8304 </span></a>
<a name="l8305"><span class="ln">8305 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--&quot;</span>
<a name="l8306"><span class="ln">8306 </span></a>
<a name="l8307"><span class="ln">8307 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very well, I am much obliged to you.  My mother is delightfully well;</span>
<a name="l8308"><span class="ln">8308 </span></a><span class="s0">and Jane caught no cold last night.  How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad</span>
<a name="l8309"><span class="ln">8309 </span></a><span class="s0">to hear such a good account.  Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--</span>
<a name="l8310"><span class="ln">8310 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will</span>
<a name="l8311"><span class="ln">8311 </span></a><span class="s0">allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother</span>
<a name="l8312"><span class="ln">8312 </span></a><span class="s0">will be so very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party,</span>
<a name="l8313"><span class="ln">8313 </span></a><span class="s0">she cannot refuse.--`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill,</span>
<a name="l8314"><span class="ln">8314 </span></a><span class="s0">`Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--</span>
<a name="l8315"><span class="ln">8315 </span></a><span class="s0">But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go</span>
<a name="l8316"><span class="ln">8316 </span></a><span class="s0">with me.--`Oh,' said he, `wait half a minute, till I have finished</span>
<a name="l8317"><span class="ln">8317 </span></a><span class="s0">my job;'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is,</span>
<a name="l8318"><span class="ln">8318 </span></a><span class="s0">in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my</span>
<a name="l8319"><span class="ln">8319 </span></a><span class="s0">mother's spectacles.--The rivet came out, you know, this morning.--</span>
<a name="l8320"><span class="ln">8320 </span></a><span class="s0">So very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles--</span>
<a name="l8321"><span class="ln">8321 </span></a><span class="s0">could not put them on.  And, by the bye, every body ought to have</span>
<a name="l8322"><span class="ln">8322 </span></a><span class="s0">two pair of spectacles; they should indeed.  Jane said so.</span>
<a name="l8323"><span class="ln">8323 </span></a><span class="s0">I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,</span>
<a name="l8324"><span class="ln">8324 </span></a><span class="s0">but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,</span>
<a name="l8325"><span class="ln">8325 </span></a><span class="s0">then another, there is no saying what, you know.  At one time Patty came</span>
<a name="l8326"><span class="ln">8326 </span></a><span class="s0">to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping.  Oh, said I,</span>
<a name="l8327"><span class="ln">8327 </span></a><span class="s0">Patty do not come with your bad news to me.  Here is the rivet</span>
<a name="l8328"><span class="ln">8328 </span></a><span class="s0">of your mistress's spectacles out.  Then the baked apples came home,</span>
<a name="l8329"><span class="ln">8329 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and</span>
<a name="l8330"><span class="ln">8330 </span></a><span class="s0">obliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some people</span>
<a name="l8331"><span class="ln">8331 </span></a><span class="s0">say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer,</span>
<a name="l8332"><span class="ln">8332 </span></a><span class="s0">but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention</span>
<a name="l8333"><span class="ln">8333 </span></a><span class="s0">from them.  And it cannot be for the value of our custom now,</span>
<a name="l8334"><span class="ln">8334 </span></a><span class="s0">for what is our consumption of bread, you know?  Only three of us.--</span>
<a name="l8335"><span class="ln">8335 </span></a><span class="s0">besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats nothing--makes such</span>
<a name="l8336"><span class="ln">8336 </span></a><span class="s0">a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it.</span>
<a name="l8337"><span class="ln">8337 </span></a><span class="s0">I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I say one</span>
<a name="l8338"><span class="ln">8338 </span></a><span class="s0">thing and then I say another, and it passes off.  But about the</span>
<a name="l8339"><span class="ln">8339 </span></a><span class="s0">middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes</span>
<a name="l8340"><span class="ln">8340 </span></a><span class="s0">so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,</span>
<a name="l8341"><span class="ln">8341 </span></a><span class="s0">for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry;</span>
<a name="l8342"><span class="ln">8342 </span></a><span class="s0">I happened to meet him in the street.  Not that I had any doubt before--</span>
<a name="l8343"><span class="ln">8343 </span></a><span class="s0">I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple.</span>
<a name="l8344"><span class="ln">8344 </span></a><span class="s0">I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the</span>
<a name="l8345"><span class="ln">8345 </span></a><span class="s0">fruit thoroughly wholesome.  We have apple-dumplings, however,</span>
<a name="l8346"><span class="ln">8346 </span></a><span class="s0">very often.  Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well,</span>
<a name="l8347"><span class="ln">8347 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will</span>
<a name="l8348"><span class="ln">8348 </span></a><span class="s0">oblige us.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8349"><span class="ln">8349 </span></a>
<a name="l8350"><span class="ln">8350 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma would be &quot;very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &amp;c.,&quot; and they</span>
<a name="l8351"><span class="ln">8351 </span></a><span class="s0">did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss</span>
<a name="l8352"><span class="ln">8352 </span></a><span class="s0">Bates than,</span>
<a name="l8353"><span class="ln">8353 </span></a>
<a name="l8354"><span class="ln">8354 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How do you do, Mrs. Ford?  I beg your pardon.  I did not see</span>
<a name="l8355"><span class="ln">8355 </span></a><span class="s0">you before.  I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons</span>
<a name="l8356"><span class="ln">8356 </span></a><span class="s0">from town.  Jane came back delighted yesterday.  Thank ye,</span>
<a name="l8357"><span class="ln">8357 </span></a><span class="s0">the gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist;</span>
<a name="l8358"><span class="ln">8358 </span></a><span class="s0">but Jane is taking them in.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8359"><span class="ln">8359 </span></a>
<a name="l8360"><span class="ln">8360 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What was I talking of?&quot; said she, beginning again when they were</span>
<a name="l8361"><span class="ln">8361 </span></a><span class="s0">all in the street.</span>
<a name="l8362"><span class="ln">8362 </span></a>
<a name="l8363"><span class="ln">8363 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.</span>
<a name="l8364"><span class="ln">8364 </span></a>
<a name="l8365"><span class="ln">8365 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my</span>
<a name="l8366"><span class="ln">8366 </span></a><span class="s0">mother's spectacles.  So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill!</span>
<a name="l8367"><span class="ln">8367 </span></a><span class="s0">`Oh!' said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job</span>
<a name="l8368"><span class="ln">8368 </span></a><span class="s0">of this kind excessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so</span>
<a name="l8369"><span class="ln">8369 </span></a><span class="s0">very. . . . Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him</span>
<a name="l8370"><span class="ln">8370 </span></a><span class="s0">before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any</span>
<a name="l8371"><span class="ln">8371 </span></a><span class="s0">thing. . . . I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly.</span>
<a name="l8372"><span class="ln">8372 </span></a><span class="s0">He seems every thing the fondest parent could. . . . `Oh!' said he,</span>
<a name="l8373"><span class="ln">8373 </span></a><span class="s0">`I can fasten the rivet.  I like a job of that sort excessively.'</span>
<a name="l8374"><span class="ln">8374 </span></a><span class="s0">I never shall forget his manner.  And when I brought out the baked</span>
<a name="l8375"><span class="ln">8375 </span></a><span class="s0">apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very</span>
<a name="l8376"><span class="ln">8376 </span></a><span class="s0">obliging as to take some, `Oh!' said he directly, `there is nothing</span>
<a name="l8377"><span class="ln">8377 </span></a><span class="s0">in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking</span>
<a name="l8378"><span class="ln">8378 </span></a><span class="s0">home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.'  That, you know, was so</span>
<a name="l8379"><span class="ln">8379 </span></a><span class="s0">very. . . . And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment.</span>
<a name="l8380"><span class="ln">8380 </span></a><span class="s0">Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them</span>
<a name="l8381"><span class="ln">8381 </span></a><span class="s0">full justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice,</span>
<a name="l8382"><span class="ln">8382 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times--</span>
<a name="l8383"><span class="ln">8383 </span></a><span class="s0">but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it.  The apples</span>
<a name="l8384"><span class="ln">8384 </span></a><span class="s0">themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt;</span>
<a name="l8385"><span class="ln">8385 </span></a><span class="s0">all from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply.</span>
<a name="l8386"><span class="ln">8386 </span></a><span class="s0">He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such</span>
<a name="l8387"><span class="ln">8387 </span></a><span class="s0">a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees--I believe there</span>
<a name="l8388"><span class="ln">8388 </span></a><span class="s0">is two of them.  My mother says the orchard was always famous</span>
<a name="l8389"><span class="ln">8389 </span></a><span class="s0">in her younger days.  But I was really quite shocked the other day--</span>
<a name="l8390"><span class="ln">8390 </span></a><span class="s0">for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples,</span>
<a name="l8391"><span class="ln">8391 </span></a><span class="s0">and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them,</span>
<a name="l8392"><span class="ln">8392 </span></a><span class="s0">and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock.</span>
<a name="l8393"><span class="ln">8393 </span></a><span class="s0">`I am sure you must be,' said he, `and I will send you</span>
<a name="l8394"><span class="ln">8394 </span></a><span class="s0">another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use.</span>
<a name="l8395"><span class="ln">8395 </span></a><span class="s0">William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year.</span>
<a name="l8396"><span class="ln">8396 </span></a><span class="s0">I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.'</span>
<a name="l8397"><span class="ln">8397 </span></a><span class="s0">So I begged he would not--for really as to ours being gone, I could</span>
<a name="l8398"><span class="ln">8398 </span></a><span class="s0">not absolutely say that we had a great many left--it was but half</span>
<a name="l8399"><span class="ln">8399 </span></a><span class="s0">a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could</span>
<a name="l8400"><span class="ln">8400 </span></a><span class="s0">not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he</span>
<a name="l8401"><span class="ln">8401 </span></a><span class="s0">had been already; and Jane said the same.  And when he was gone,</span>
<a name="l8402"><span class="ln">8402 </span></a><span class="s0">she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say quarrelled,</span>
<a name="l8403"><span class="ln">8403 </span></a><span class="s0">for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed</span>
<a name="l8404"><span class="ln">8404 </span></a><span class="s0">that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had</span>
<a name="l8405"><span class="ln">8405 </span></a><span class="s0">made him believe we had a great many left.  Oh, said I, my dear,</span>
<a name="l8406"><span class="ln">8406 </span></a><span class="s0">I did say as much as I could.  However, the very same evening</span>
<a name="l8407"><span class="ln">8407 </span></a><span class="s0">William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same</span>
<a name="l8408"><span class="ln">8408 </span></a><span class="s0">sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged,</span>
<a name="l8409"><span class="ln">8409 </span></a><span class="s0">and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing,</span>
<a name="l8410"><span class="ln">8410 </span></a><span class="s0">as you may suppose.  William Larkins is such an old acquaintance!</span>
<a name="l8411"><span class="ln">8411 </span></a><span class="s0">I am always glad to see him.  But, however, I found afterwards</span>
<a name="l8412"><span class="ln">8412 </span></a><span class="s0">from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort</span>
<a name="l8413"><span class="ln">8413 </span></a><span class="s0">his master had; he had brought them all--and now his master had not</span>
<a name="l8414"><span class="ln">8414 </span></a><span class="s0">one left to bake or boil.  William did not seem to mind it himself,</span>
<a name="l8415"><span class="ln">8415 </span></a><span class="s0">he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William,</span>
<a name="l8416"><span class="ln">8416 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing;</span>
<a name="l8417"><span class="ln">8417 </span></a><span class="s0">but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being</span>
<a name="l8418"><span class="ln">8418 </span></a><span class="s0">all sent away.  She could not bear that her master should not be</span>
<a name="l8419"><span class="ln">8419 </span></a><span class="s0">able to have another apple-tart this spring.  He told Patty this,</span>
<a name="l8420"><span class="ln">8420 </span></a><span class="s0">but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us</span>
<a name="l8421"><span class="ln">8421 </span></a><span class="s0">about it, for Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as</span>
<a name="l8422"><span class="ln">8422 </span></a><span class="s0">so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder.</span>
<a name="l8423"><span class="ln">8423 </span></a><span class="s0">And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed!</span>
<a name="l8424"><span class="ln">8424 </span></a><span class="s0">I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for</span>
<a name="l8425"><span class="ln">8425 </span></a><span class="s0">the world!  He would be so very. . . . I wanted to keep it from</span>
<a name="l8426"><span class="ln">8426 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was</span>
<a name="l8427"><span class="ln">8427 </span></a><span class="s0">aware.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8428"><span class="ln">8428 </span></a>
<a name="l8429"><span class="ln">8429 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors</span>
<a name="l8430"><span class="ln">8430 </span></a><span class="s0">walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,</span>
<a name="l8431"><span class="ln">8431 </span></a><span class="s0">pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.</span>
<a name="l8432"><span class="ln">8432 </span></a>
<a name="l8433"><span class="ln">8433 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning.</span>
<a name="l8434"><span class="ln">8434 </span></a><span class="s0">Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--</span>
<a name="l8435"><span class="ln">8435 </span></a><span class="s0">rather darker and narrower than one could wish.  Miss Smith,</span>
<a name="l8436"><span class="ln">8436 </span></a><span class="s0">pray take care.  Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you</span>
<a name="l8437"><span class="ln">8437 </span></a><span class="s0">hit your foot.  Miss Smith, the step at the turning.&quot;</span>

<a name="l8442"><span class="ln">8442 </span></a>
<a name="l8443"><span class="ln">8443 </span></a>
<a name="l8444"><span class="ln">8444 </span></a><span class="s0">The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered,</span>
<a name="l8445"><span class="ln">8445 </span></a><span class="s0">was tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,</span>
<a name="l8446"><span class="ln">8446 </span></a><span class="s0">slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table</span>
<a name="l8447"><span class="ln">8447 </span></a><span class="s0">near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,</span>
<a name="l8448"><span class="ln">8448 </span></a><span class="s0">standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.</span>
<a name="l8449"><span class="ln">8449 </span></a>
<a name="l8450"><span class="ln">8450 </span></a><span class="s0">Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most</span>
<a name="l8451"><span class="ln">8451 </span></a><span class="s0">happy countenance on seeing Emma again.</span>
<a name="l8452"><span class="ln">8452 </span></a>
<a name="l8453"><span class="ln">8453 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This is a pleasure,&quot; said he, in rather a low voice, &quot;coming at</span>
<a name="l8454"><span class="ln">8454 </span></a><span class="s0">least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.  You find me</span>
<a name="l8455"><span class="ln">8455 </span></a><span class="s0">trying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8456"><span class="ln">8456 </span></a>
<a name="l8457"><span class="ln">8457 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What!&quot; said Mrs. Weston, &quot;have not you finished it yet? you would</span>
<a name="l8458"><span class="ln">8458 </span></a><span class="s0">not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8459"><span class="ln">8459 </span></a>
<a name="l8460"><span class="ln">8460 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have not been working uninterruptedly,&quot; he replied, &quot;I have been</span>
<a name="l8461"><span class="ln">8461 </span></a><span class="s0">assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,</span>
<a name="l8462"><span class="ln">8462 </span></a><span class="s0">it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe.</span>
<a name="l8463"><span class="ln">8463 </span></a><span class="s0">You see we have been wedging one leg with paper.  This was very kind</span>
<a name="l8464"><span class="ln">8464 </span></a><span class="s0">of you to be persuaded to come.  I was almost afraid you would be</span>
<a name="l8465"><span class="ln">8465 </span></a><span class="s0">hurrying home.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8466"><span class="ln">8466 </span></a>
<a name="l8467"><span class="ln">8467 </span></a><span class="s0">He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently</span>
<a name="l8468"><span class="ln">8468 </span></a><span class="s0">employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying</span>
<a name="l8469"><span class="ln">8469 </span></a><span class="s0">to make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was</span>
<a name="l8470"><span class="ln">8470 </span></a><span class="s0">quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again.  That she was not</span>
<a name="l8471"><span class="ln">8471 </span></a><span class="s0">immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves;</span>
<a name="l8472"><span class="ln">8472 </span></a><span class="s0">she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it</span>
<a name="l8473"><span class="ln">8473 </span></a><span class="s0">without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance;</span>
<a name="l8474"><span class="ln">8474 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin,</span>
<a name="l8475"><span class="ln">8475 </span></a><span class="s0">and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.</span>
<a name="l8476"><span class="ln">8476 </span></a>
<a name="l8477"><span class="ln">8477 </span></a><span class="s0">At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given,</span>
<a name="l8478"><span class="ln">8478 </span></a><span class="s0">the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to.</span>
<a name="l8479"><span class="ln">8479 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again;</span>
<a name="l8480"><span class="ln">8480 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every</span>
<a name="l8481"><span class="ln">8481 </span></a><span class="s0">proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the</span>
<a name="l8482"><span class="ln">8482 </span></a><span class="s0">highest promise.</span>
<a name="l8483"><span class="ln">8483 </span></a>
<a name="l8484"><span class="ln">8484 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,&quot; said Frank Churchill,</span>
<a name="l8485"><span class="ln">8485 </span></a><span class="s0">with a smile at Emma, &quot;the person has not chosen ill.  I heard a good</span>
<a name="l8486"><span class="ln">8486 </span></a><span class="s0">deal of Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the</span>
<a name="l8487"><span class="ln">8487 </span></a><span class="s0">upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would</span>
<a name="l8488"><span class="ln">8488 </span></a><span class="s0">particularly prize.  I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave</span>
<a name="l8489"><span class="ln">8489 </span></a><span class="s0">his friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself.</span>
<a name="l8490"><span class="ln">8490 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not you think so?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8491"><span class="ln">8491 </span></a>
<a name="l8492"><span class="ln">8492 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane did not look round.  She was not obliged to hear.  Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l8493"><span class="ln">8493 </span></a><span class="s0">had been speaking to her at the same moment.</span>
<a name="l8494"><span class="ln">8494 </span></a>
<a name="l8495"><span class="ln">8495 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is not fair,&quot; said Emma, in a whisper; &quot;mine was a random guess.</span>
<a name="l8496"><span class="ln">8496 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not distress her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8497"><span class="ln">8497 </span></a>
<a name="l8498"><span class="ln">8498 </span></a><span class="s0">He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little</span>
<a name="l8499"><span class="ln">8499 </span></a><span class="s0">doubt and very little mercy.  Soon afterwards he began again,</span>
<a name="l8500"><span class="ln">8500 </span></a>
<a name="l8501"><span class="ln">8501 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure</span>
<a name="l8502"><span class="ln">8502 </span></a><span class="s0">on this occasion, Miss Fairfax.  I dare say they often think of you,</span>
<a name="l8503"><span class="ln">8503 </span></a><span class="s0">and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's</span>
<a name="l8504"><span class="ln">8504 </span></a><span class="s0">coming to hand.  Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business</span>
<a name="l8505"><span class="ln">8505 </span></a><span class="s0">to be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be</span>
<a name="l8506"><span class="ln">8506 </span></a><span class="s0">the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may</span>
<a name="l8507"><span class="ln">8507 </span></a><span class="s0">have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time,</span>
<a name="l8508"><span class="ln">8508 </span></a><span class="s0">to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8509"><span class="ln">8509 </span></a>
<a name="l8510"><span class="ln">8510 </span></a><span class="s0">He paused.  She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,</span>
<a name="l8511"><span class="ln">8511 </span></a>
<a name="l8512"><span class="ln">8512 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,&quot; said she, in a voice</span>
<a name="l8513"><span class="ln">8513 </span></a><span class="s0">of forced calmness, &quot;I can imagine nothing with any confidence.</span>
<a name="l8514"><span class="ln">8514 </span></a><span class="s0">It must be all conjecture.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8515"><span class="ln">8515 </span></a>
<a name="l8516"><span class="ln">8516 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes</span>
<a name="l8517"><span class="ln">8517 </span></a><span class="s0">one conjectures wrong.  I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall</span>
<a name="l8518"><span class="ln">8518 </span></a><span class="s0">make this rivet quite firm.  What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l8519"><span class="ln">8519 </span></a><span class="s0">when hard at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen,</span>
<a name="l8520"><span class="ln">8520 </span></a><span class="s0">I suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get</span>
<a name="l8521"><span class="ln">8521 </span></a><span class="s0">hold of a word--Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing.</span>
<a name="l8522"><span class="ln">8522 </span></a><span class="s0">There, it is done.  I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,)</span>
<a name="l8523"><span class="ln">8523 </span></a><span class="s0">of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8524"><span class="ln">8524 </span></a>
<a name="l8525"><span class="ln">8525 </span></a><span class="s0">He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape</span>
<a name="l8526"><span class="ln">8526 </span></a><span class="s0">a little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged</span>
<a name="l8527"><span class="ln">8527 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.</span>
<a name="l8528"><span class="ln">8528 </span></a>
<a name="l8529"><span class="ln">8529 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If you are very kind,&quot; said he, &quot;it will be one of the waltzes</span>
<a name="l8530"><span class="ln">8530 </span></a><span class="s0">we danced last night;--let me live them over again.  You did not</span>
<a name="l8531"><span class="ln">8531 </span></a><span class="s0">enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time.  I believe</span>
<a name="l8532"><span class="ln">8532 </span></a><span class="s0">you were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--</span>
<a name="l8533"><span class="ln">8533 </span></a><span class="s0">all the worlds one ever has to give--for another half-hour.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8534"><span class="ln">8534 </span></a>
<a name="l8535"><span class="ln">8535 </span></a><span class="s0">She played.</span>
<a name="l8536"><span class="ln">8536 </span></a>
<a name="l8537"><span class="ln">8537 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy!--</span>
<a name="l8538"><span class="ln">8538 </span></a><span class="s0">If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8539"><span class="ln">8539 </span></a>
<a name="l8540"><span class="ln">8540 </span></a><span class="s0">She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played</span>
<a name="l8541"><span class="ln">8541 </span></a><span class="s0">something else.  He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,</span>
<a name="l8542"><span class="ln">8542 </span></a><span class="s0">and turning to Emma, said,</span>
<a name="l8543"><span class="ln">8543 </span></a>
<a name="l8544"><span class="ln">8544 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Here is something quite new to me.  Do you know it?--Cramer.--</span>
<a name="l8545"><span class="ln">8545 </span></a><span class="s0">And here are a new set of Irish melodies.  That, from such a quarter,</span>
<a name="l8546"><span class="ln">8546 </span></a><span class="s0">one might expect.  This was all sent with the instrument.  Very thoughtful</span>
<a name="l8547"><span class="ln">8547 </span></a><span class="s0">of Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have</span>
<a name="l8548"><span class="ln">8548 </span></a><span class="s0">no music here.  I honour that part of the attention particularly;</span>
<a name="l8549"><span class="ln">8549 </span></a><span class="s0">it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.  Nothing hastily</span>
<a name="l8550"><span class="ln">8550 </span></a><span class="s0">done; nothing incomplete.  True affection only could have prompted it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8551"><span class="ln">8551 </span></a>
<a name="l8552"><span class="ln">8552 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;</span>
<a name="l8553"><span class="ln">8553 </span></a><span class="s0">and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught</span>
<a name="l8554"><span class="ln">8554 </span></a><span class="s0">the remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush</span>
<a name="l8555"><span class="ln">8555 </span></a><span class="s0">of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight,</span>
<a name="l8556"><span class="ln">8556 </span></a><span class="s0">she had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction</span>
<a name="l8557"><span class="ln">8557 </span></a><span class="s0">with respect to her.--This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax</span>
<a name="l8558"><span class="ln">8558 </span></a><span class="s0">was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.</span>
<a name="l8559"><span class="ln">8559 </span></a>
<a name="l8560"><span class="ln">8560 </span></a><span class="s0">He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--</span>
<a name="l8561"><span class="ln">8561 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma took the opportunity of whispering,</span>
<a name="l8562"><span class="ln">8562 </span></a>
<a name="l8563"><span class="ln">8563 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You speak too plain.  She must understand you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8564"><span class="ln">8564 </span></a>
<a name="l8565"><span class="ln">8565 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope she does.  I would have her understand me.  I am not</span>
<a name="l8566"><span class="ln">8566 </span></a><span class="s0">in the least ashamed of my meaning.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8567"><span class="ln">8567 </span></a>
<a name="l8568"><span class="ln">8568 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up</span>
<a name="l8569"><span class="ln">8569 </span></a><span class="s0">the idea.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8570"><span class="ln">8570 </span></a>
<a name="l8571"><span class="ln">8571 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me.</span>
<a name="l8572"><span class="ln">8572 </span></a><span class="s0">I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways.  Leave shame to her.</span>
<a name="l8573"><span class="ln">8573 </span></a><span class="s0">If she does wrong, she ought to feel it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8574"><span class="ln">8574 </span></a>
<a name="l8575"><span class="ln">8575 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She is not entirely without it, I think.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8576"><span class="ln">8576 </span></a>
<a name="l8577"><span class="ln">8577 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not see much sign of it.  She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_</span>
<a name="l8578"><span class="ln">8578 </span></a><span class="s0">at this moment--_his_ favourite.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8579"><span class="ln">8579 </span></a>
<a name="l8580"><span class="ln">8580 </span></a><span class="s0">Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window,</span>
<a name="l8581"><span class="ln">8581 </span></a><span class="s0">descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off.</span>
<a name="l8582"><span class="ln">8582 </span></a>
<a name="l8583"><span class="ln">8583 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible,</span>
<a name="l8584"><span class="ln">8584 </span></a><span class="s0">just to thank him.  I will not open the window here; it would give</span>
<a name="l8585"><span class="ln">8585 </span></a><span class="s0">you all cold; but I can go into my mother's room you know.  I dare</span>
<a name="l8586"><span class="ln">8586 </span></a><span class="s0">say he will come in when he knows who is here.  Quite delightful</span>
<a name="l8587"><span class="ln">8587 </span></a><span class="s0">to have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured!&quot;</span>
<a name="l8588"><span class="ln">8588 </span></a>
<a name="l8589"><span class="ln">8589 </span></a><span class="s0">She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening</span>
<a name="l8590"><span class="ln">8590 </span></a><span class="s0">the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention,</span>
<a name="l8591"><span class="ln">8591 </span></a><span class="s0">and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard</span>
<a name="l8592"><span class="ln">8592 </span></a><span class="s0">by the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment.</span>
<a name="l8593"><span class="ln">8593 </span></a>
<a name="l8594"><span class="ln">8594 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you.  So obliged</span>
<a name="l8595"><span class="ln">8595 </span></a><span class="s0">to you for the carriage last night.  We were just in time;</span>
<a name="l8596"><span class="ln">8596 </span></a><span class="s0">my mother just ready for us.  Pray come in; do come in.  You will</span>
<a name="l8597"><span class="ln">8597 </span></a><span class="s0">find some friends here.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8598"><span class="ln">8598 </span></a>
<a name="l8599"><span class="ln">8599 </span></a><span class="s0">So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard</span>
<a name="l8600"><span class="ln">8600 </span></a><span class="s0">in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,</span>
<a name="l8601"><span class="ln">8601 </span></a>
<a name="l8602"><span class="ln">8602 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all,</span>
<a name="l8603"><span class="ln">8603 </span></a><span class="s0">but particularly your niece.  How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she</span>
<a name="l8604"><span class="ln">8604 </span></a><span class="s0">caught no cold last night.  How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss</span>
<a name="l8605"><span class="ln">8605 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax is.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8606"><span class="ln">8606 </span></a>
<a name="l8607"><span class="ln">8607 </span></a><span class="s0">And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he</span>
<a name="l8608"><span class="ln">8608 </span></a><span class="s0">would hear her in any thing else.  The listeners were amused;</span>
<a name="l8609"><span class="ln">8609 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning.  But Emma</span>
<a name="l8610"><span class="ln">8610 </span></a><span class="s0">still shook her head in steady scepticism.</span>
<a name="l8611"><span class="ln">8611 </span></a>
<a name="l8612"><span class="ln">8612 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,&quot;</span>
<a name="l8613"><span class="ln">8613 </span></a><span class="s0">resumed Miss Bates.</span>
<a name="l8614"><span class="ln">8614 </span></a>
<a name="l8615"><span class="ln">8615 </span></a><span class="s0">He cut her short with,</span>
<a name="l8616"><span class="ln">8616 </span></a>
<a name="l8617"><span class="ln">8617 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am going to Kingston.  Can I do any thing for you?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8618"><span class="ln">8618 </span></a>
<a name="l8619"><span class="ln">8619 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day</span>
<a name="l8620"><span class="ln">8620 </span></a><span class="s0">she wanted something from Kingston.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8621"><span class="ln">8621 </span></a>
<a name="l8622"><span class="ln">8622 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mrs. Cole has servants to send.  Can I do any thing for _you_?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8623"><span class="ln">8623 </span></a>
<a name="l8624"><span class="ln">8624 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, I thank you.  But do come in.  Who do you think is here?--</span>
<a name="l8625"><span class="ln">8625 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the</span>
<a name="l8626"><span class="ln">8626 </span></a><span class="s0">new pianoforte.  Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8627"><span class="ln">8627 </span></a>
<a name="l8628"><span class="ln">8628 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said he, in a deliberating manner, &quot;for five minutes, perhaps.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8629"><span class="ln">8629 </span></a>
<a name="l8630"><span class="ln">8630 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;</span>
<a name="l8631"><span class="ln">8631 </span></a><span class="s0">so many friends!&quot;</span>
<a name="l8632"><span class="ln">8632 </span></a>
<a name="l8633"><span class="ln">8633 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, not now, I thank you.  I could not stay two minutes.</span>
<a name="l8634"><span class="ln">8634 </span></a><span class="s0">I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8635"><span class="ln">8635 </span></a>
<a name="l8636"><span class="ln">8636 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! do come in.  They will be so very happy to see you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8637"><span class="ln">8637 </span></a>
<a name="l8638"><span class="ln">8638 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, no; your room is full enough.  I will call another day,</span>
<a name="l8639"><span class="ln">8639 </span></a><span class="s0">and hear the pianoforte.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8640"><span class="ln">8640 </span></a>
<a name="l8641"><span class="ln">8641 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, I am so sorry!--Oh!  Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party</span>
<a name="l8642"><span class="ln">8642 </span></a><span class="s0">last night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--</span>
<a name="l8643"><span class="ln">8643 </span></a><span class="s0">Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill;</span>
<a name="l8644"><span class="ln">8644 </span></a><span class="s0">I never saw any thing equal to it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8645"><span class="ln">8645 </span></a>
<a name="l8646"><span class="ln">8646 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose</span>
<a name="l8647"><span class="ln">8647 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing</span>
<a name="l8648"><span class="ln">8648 </span></a><span class="s0">that passes.  And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss</span>
<a name="l8649"><span class="ln">8649 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax should not be mentioned too.  I think Miss Fairfax dances</span>
<a name="l8650"><span class="ln">8650 </span></a><span class="s0">very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player,</span>
<a name="l8651"><span class="ln">8651 </span></a><span class="s0">without exception, in England.  Now, if your friends have any gratitude,</span>
<a name="l8652"><span class="ln">8652 </span></a><span class="s0">they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return;</span>
<a name="l8653"><span class="ln">8653 </span></a><span class="s0">but I cannot stay to hear it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8654"><span class="ln">8654 </span></a>
<a name="l8655"><span class="ln">8655 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!  Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--</span>
<a name="l8656"><span class="ln">8656 </span></a><span class="s0">so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!&quot;</span>
<a name="l8657"><span class="ln">8657 </span></a>
<a name="l8658"><span class="ln">8658 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What is the matter now?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8659"><span class="ln">8659 </span></a>
<a name="l8660"><span class="ln">8660 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To think of your sending us all your store apples.  You said you had</span>
<a name="l8661"><span class="ln">8661 </span></a><span class="s0">a great many, and now you have not one left.  We really are so shocked!</span>
<a name="l8662"><span class="ln">8662 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Hodges may well be angry.  William Larkins mentioned it here.</span>
<a name="l8663"><span class="ln">8663 </span></a><span class="s0">You should not have done it, indeed you should not.  Ah! he is off.</span>
<a name="l8664"><span class="ln">8664 </span></a><span class="s0">He never can bear to be thanked.  But I thought he would have staid now,</span>
<a name="l8665"><span class="ln">8665 </span></a><span class="s0">and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . Well,</span>
<a name="l8666"><span class="ln">8666 </span></a><span class="s0">(returning to the room,) I have not been able to succeed.</span>
<a name="l8667"><span class="ln">8667 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley cannot stop.  He is going to Kingston.  He asked me</span>
<a name="l8668"><span class="ln">8668 </span></a><span class="s0">if he could do any thing. . . .&quot;</span>
<a name="l8669"><span class="ln">8669 </span></a>
<a name="l8670"><span class="ln">8670 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane, &quot;we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8671"><span class="ln">8671 </span></a>
<a name="l8672"><span class="ln">8672 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door</span>
<a name="l8673"><span class="ln">8673 </span></a><span class="s0">was open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud.</span>
<a name="l8674"><span class="ln">8674 </span></a><span class="s0">You must have heard every thing to be sure.  `Can I do any thing</span>
<a name="l8675"><span class="ln">8675 </span></a><span class="s0">for you at Kingston?' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . Oh!</span>
<a name="l8676"><span class="ln">8676 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse, must you be going?--You seem but just come--so very</span>
<a name="l8677"><span class="ln">8677 </span></a><span class="s0">obliging of you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8678"><span class="ln">8678 </span></a>
<a name="l8679"><span class="ln">8679 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already</span>
<a name="l8680"><span class="ln">8680 </span></a><span class="s0">lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was</span>
<a name="l8681"><span class="ln">8681 </span></a><span class="s0">perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking</span>
<a name="l8682"><span class="ln">8682 </span></a><span class="s0">leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young</span>
<a name="l8683"><span class="ln">8683 </span></a><span class="s0">ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.</span>
<a name="l8684"><span class="ln">8684 </span></a>
<a name="l8685"><span class="ln">8685 </span></a>
<a name="l8686"><span class="ln">8686 </span></a>
<a name="l8687"><span class="ln">8687 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER XI</span>
<a name="l8688"><span class="ln">8688 </span></a>
<a name="l8689"><span class="ln">8689 </span></a>
<a name="l8690"><span class="ln">8690 </span></a><span class="s0">It may be possible to do without dancing entirely.  Instances have</span>
<a name="l8691"><span class="ln">8691 </span></a><span class="s0">been known of young people passing many, many months successively,</span>
<a name="l8692"><span class="ln">8692 </span></a><span class="s0">without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury</span>
<a name="l8693"><span class="ln">8693 </span></a><span class="s0">accrue either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--</span>
<a name="l8694"><span class="ln">8694 </span></a><span class="s0">when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly,</span>
<a name="l8695"><span class="ln">8695 </span></a><span class="s0">felt--it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.</span>
<a name="l8696"><span class="ln">8696 </span></a>
<a name="l8697"><span class="ln">8697 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;</span>
<a name="l8698"><span class="ln">8698 </span></a><span class="s0">and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded</span>
<a name="l8699"><span class="ln">8699 </span></a><span class="s0">to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young</span>
<a name="l8700"><span class="ln">8700 </span></a><span class="s0">people in schemes on the subject.  Frank's was the first idea;</span>
<a name="l8701"><span class="ln">8701 </span></a><span class="s0">and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best</span>
<a name="l8702"><span class="ln">8702 </span></a><span class="s0">judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation</span>
<a name="l8703"><span class="ln">8703 </span></a><span class="s0">and appearance.  But still she had inclination enough for shewing</span>
<a name="l8704"><span class="ln">8704 </span></a><span class="s0">people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss</span>
<a name="l8705"><span class="ln">8705 </span></a><span class="s0">Woodhouse danced--for doing that in which she need not blush to compare</span>
<a name="l8706"><span class="ln">8706 </span></a><span class="s0">herself with Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself,</span>
<a name="l8707"><span class="ln">8707 </span></a><span class="s0">without any of the wicked aids of vanity--to assist him first</span>
<a name="l8708"><span class="ln">8708 </span></a><span class="s0">in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made</span>
<a name="l8709"><span class="ln">8709 </span></a><span class="s0">to hold--and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour,</span>
<a name="l8710"><span class="ln">8710 </span></a><span class="s0">in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could</span>
<a name="l8711"><span class="ln">8711 </span></a><span class="s0">say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.</span>
<a name="l8712"><span class="ln">8712 </span></a>
<a name="l8713"><span class="ln">8713 </span></a><span class="s0">His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's</span>
<a name="l8714"><span class="ln">8714 </span></a><span class="s0">should be finished there--that the same party should be collected,</span>
<a name="l8715"><span class="ln">8715 </span></a><span class="s0">and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence.</span>
<a name="l8716"><span class="ln">8716 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment,</span>
<a name="l8717"><span class="ln">8717 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they</span>
<a name="l8718"><span class="ln">8718 </span></a><span class="s0">could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed,</span>
<a name="l8719"><span class="ln">8719 </span></a><span class="s0">of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the</span>
<a name="l8720"><span class="ln">8720 </span></a><span class="s0">indispensable division of space to every couple.</span>
<a name="l8721"><span class="ln">8721 </span></a>
<a name="l8722"><span class="ln">8722 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two</span>
<a name="l8723"><span class="ln">8723 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Coxes five,&quot; had been repeated many times over.  &quot;And there</span>
<a name="l8724"><span class="ln">8724 </span></a><span class="s0">will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself,</span>
<a name="l8725"><span class="ln">8725 </span></a><span class="s0">besides Mr. Knightley.  Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure.</span>
<a name="l8726"><span class="ln">8726 </span></a><span class="s0">You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss</span>
<a name="l8727"><span class="ln">8727 </span></a><span class="s0">Coxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8728"><span class="ln">8728 </span></a>
<a name="l8729"><span class="ln">8729 </span></a><span class="s0">But soon it came to be on one side,</span>
<a name="l8730"><span class="ln">8730 </span></a>
<a name="l8731"><span class="ln">8731 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think</span>
<a name="l8732"><span class="ln">8732 </span></a><span class="s0">there will.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8733"><span class="ln">8733 </span></a>
<a name="l8734"><span class="ln">8734 </span></a><span class="s0">On another,</span>
<a name="l8735"><span class="ln">8735 </span></a>
<a name="l8736"><span class="ln">8736 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth</span>
<a name="l8737"><span class="ln">8737 </span></a><span class="s0">while to stand up.  Five couple are nothing, when one thinks</span>
<a name="l8738"><span class="ln">8738 </span></a><span class="s0">seriously about it.  It will not do to _invite_ five couple.</span>
<a name="l8739"><span class="ln">8739 </span></a><span class="s0">It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8740"><span class="ln">8740 </span></a>
<a name="l8741"><span class="ln">8741 </span></a><span class="s0">Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother's,</span>
<a name="l8742"><span class="ln">8742 </span></a><span class="s0">and must be invited with the rest.  Somebody else believed</span>
<a name="l8743"><span class="ln">8743 </span></a><span class="s0">_Mrs_. Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had</span>
<a name="l8744"><span class="ln">8744 </span></a><span class="s0">been asked.  A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last,</span>
<a name="l8745"><span class="ln">8745 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included,</span>
<a name="l8746"><span class="ln">8746 </span></a><span class="s0">and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out,</span>
<a name="l8747"><span class="ln">8747 </span></a><span class="s0">it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten,</span>
<a name="l8748"><span class="ln">8748 </span></a><span class="s0">and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they</span>
<a name="l8749"><span class="ln">8749 </span></a><span class="s0">could be disposed of.</span>
<a name="l8750"><span class="ln">8750 </span></a>
<a name="l8751"><span class="ln">8751 </span></a><span class="s0">The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other.</span>
<a name="l8752"><span class="ln">8752 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8753"><span class="ln">8753 </span></a><span class="s0">It seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that</span>
<a name="l8754"><span class="ln">8754 </span></a><span class="s0">many of them wanted a better.  Emma said it would be awkward;</span>
<a name="l8755"><span class="ln">8755 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l8756"><span class="ln">8756 </span></a><span class="s0">opposed it earnestly, on the score of health.  It made him so</span>
<a name="l8757"><span class="ln">8757 </span></a><span class="s0">very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.</span>
<a name="l8758"><span class="ln">8758 </span></a>
<a name="l8759"><span class="ln">8759 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no,&quot; said he; &quot;it would be the extreme of imprudence.</span>
<a name="l8760"><span class="ln">8760 </span></a><span class="s0">I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong.  She would</span>
<a name="l8761"><span class="ln">8761 </span></a><span class="s0">catch a dreadful cold.  So would poor little Harriet.</span>
<a name="l8762"><span class="ln">8762 </span></a><span class="s0">So you would all.  Mrs. Weston, you would be quite laid up;</span>
<a name="l8763"><span class="ln">8763 </span></a><span class="s0">do not let them talk of such a wild thing.  Pray do not let them</span>
<a name="l8764"><span class="ln">8764 </span></a><span class="s0">talk of it.  That young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless.</span>
<a name="l8765"><span class="ln">8765 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing.</span>
<a name="l8766"><span class="ln">8766 </span></a><span class="s0">He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping</span>
<a name="l8767"><span class="ln">8767 </span></a><span class="s0">them open very inconsiderately.  He does not think of the draught.</span>
<a name="l8768"><span class="ln">8768 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not quite</span>
<a name="l8769"><span class="ln">8769 </span></a><span class="s0">the thing!&quot;</span>
<a name="l8770"><span class="ln">8770 </span></a>
<a name="l8771"><span class="ln">8771 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge.  She knew the importance</span>
<a name="l8772"><span class="ln">8772 </span></a><span class="s0">of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away.  Every door</span>
<a name="l8773"><span class="ln">8773 </span></a><span class="s0">was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme</span>
<a name="l8774"><span class="ln">8774 </span></a><span class="s0">of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again;</span>
<a name="l8775"><span class="ln">8775 </span></a><span class="s0">and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space</span>
<a name="l8776"><span class="ln">8776 </span></a><span class="s0">which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient</span>
<a name="l8777"><span class="ln">8777 </span></a><span class="s0">for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough</span>
<a name="l8778"><span class="ln">8778 </span></a><span class="s0">for ten.</span>
<a name="l8779"><span class="ln">8779 </span></a>
<a name="l8780"><span class="ln">8780 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We were too magnificent,&quot; said he.  &quot;We allowed unnecessary room.</span>
<a name="l8781"><span class="ln">8781 </span></a><span class="s0">Ten couple may stand here very well.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8782"><span class="ln">8782 </span></a>
<a name="l8783"><span class="ln">8783 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma demurred.  &quot;It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could</span>
<a name="l8784"><span class="ln">8784 </span></a><span class="s0">be worse than dancing without space to turn in?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8785"><span class="ln">8785 </span></a>
<a name="l8786"><span class="ln">8786 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very true,&quot; he gravely replied; &quot;it was very bad.&quot;  But still he</span>
<a name="l8787"><span class="ln">8787 </span></a><span class="s0">went on measuring, and still he ended with,</span>
<a name="l8788"><span class="ln">8788 </span></a>
<a name="l8789"><span class="ln">8789 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8790"><span class="ln">8790 </span></a>
<a name="l8791"><span class="ln">8791 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, no,&quot; said she, &quot;you are quite unreasonable.  It would be dreadful</span>
<a name="l8792"><span class="ln">8792 </span></a><span class="s0">to be standing so close!  Nothing can be farther from pleasure</span>
<a name="l8793"><span class="ln">8793 </span></a><span class="s0">than to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!&quot;</span>
<a name="l8794"><span class="ln">8794 </span></a>
<a name="l8795"><span class="ln">8795 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There is no denying it,&quot; he replied.  &quot;I agree with you exactly.</span>
<a name="l8796"><span class="ln">8796 </span></a><span class="s0">A crowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving</span>
<a name="l8797"><span class="ln">8797 </span></a><span class="s0">pictures in a few words.  Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however,</span>
<a name="l8798"><span class="ln">8798 </span></a><span class="s0">having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up.</span>
<a name="l8799"><span class="ln">8799 </span></a><span class="s0">It would be a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do</span>
<a name="l8800"><span class="ln">8800 </span></a><span class="s0">not know that--I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand</span>
<a name="l8801"><span class="ln">8801 </span></a><span class="s0">here very well.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8802"><span class="ln">8802 </span></a>
<a name="l8803"><span class="ln">8803 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little</span>
<a name="l8804"><span class="ln">8804 </span></a><span class="s0">self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure</span>
<a name="l8805"><span class="ln">8805 </span></a><span class="s0">of dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave</span>
<a name="l8806"><span class="ln">8806 </span></a><span class="s0">the rest.  Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been</span>
<a name="l8807"><span class="ln">8807 </span></a><span class="s0">worth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value</span>
<a name="l8808"><span class="ln">8808 </span></a><span class="s0">of his preference, and the character of his temper; but for</span>
<a name="l8809"><span class="ln">8809 </span></a><span class="s0">all the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.</span>
<a name="l8810"><span class="ln">8810 </span></a>
<a name="l8811"><span class="ln">8811 </span></a><span class="s0">Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered</span>
<a name="l8812"><span class="ln">8812 </span></a><span class="s0">the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance</span>
<a name="l8813"><span class="ln">8813 </span></a><span class="s0">of the scheme.  It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.</span>
<a name="l8814"><span class="ln">8814 </span></a>
<a name="l8815"><span class="ln">8815 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, Miss Woodhouse,&quot; he almost immediately began, &quot;your inclination</span>
<a name="l8816"><span class="ln">8816 </span></a><span class="s0">for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the</span>
<a name="l8817"><span class="ln">8817 </span></a><span class="s0">terrors of my father's little rooms.  I bring a new proposal</span>
<a name="l8818"><span class="ln">8818 </span></a><span class="s0">on the subject:--a thought of my father's, which waits only your</span>
<a name="l8819"><span class="ln">8819 </span></a><span class="s0">approbation to be acted upon.  May I hope for the honour of your</span>
<a name="l8820"><span class="ln">8820 </span></a><span class="s0">hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball,</span>
<a name="l8821"><span class="ln">8821 </span></a><span class="s0">to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8822"><span class="ln">8822 </span></a>
<a name="l8823"><span class="ln">8823 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The Crown!&quot;</span>
<a name="l8824"><span class="ln">8824 </span></a>
<a name="l8825"><span class="ln">8825 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,</span>
<a name="l8826"><span class="ln">8826 </span></a><span class="s0">my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.</span>
<a name="l8827"><span class="ln">8827 </span></a><span class="s0">Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful</span>
<a name="l8828"><span class="ln">8828 </span></a><span class="s0">welcome than at Randalls.  It is his own idea.  Mrs. Weston sees</span>
<a name="l8829"><span class="ln">8829 </span></a><span class="s0">no objection to it, provided you are satisfied.  This is what we</span>
<a name="l8830"><span class="ln">8830 </span></a><span class="s0">all feel.  Oh! you were perfectly right!  Ten couple, in either of</span>
<a name="l8831"><span class="ln">8831 </span></a><span class="s0">the Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt</span>
<a name="l8832"><span class="ln">8832 </span></a><span class="s0">how right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing</span>
<a name="l8833"><span class="ln">8833 </span></a><span class="s0">_any_ _thing_ to like to yield.  Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--</span>
<a name="l8834"><span class="ln">8834 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope you consent?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8835"><span class="ln">8835 </span></a>
<a name="l8836"><span class="ln">8836 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and</span>
<a name="l8837"><span class="ln">8837 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston do not.  I think it admirable; and, as far as I can</span>
<a name="l8838"><span class="ln">8838 </span></a><span class="s0">answer for myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement</span>
<a name="l8839"><span class="ln">8839 </span></a><span class="s0">that could be.  Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8840"><span class="ln">8840 </span></a>
<a name="l8841"><span class="ln">8841 </span></a><span class="s0">She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully</span>
<a name="l8842"><span class="ln">8842 </span></a><span class="s0">comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations</span>
<a name="l8843"><span class="ln">8843 </span></a><span class="s0">were necessary to make it acceptable.</span>
<a name="l8844"><span class="ln">8844 </span></a>
<a name="l8845"><span class="ln">8845 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--</span>
<a name="l8846"><span class="ln">8846 </span></a><span class="s0">much worse than the other.  A room at an inn was always damp</span>
<a name="l8847"><span class="ln">8847 </span></a><span class="s0">and dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited.</span>
<a name="l8848"><span class="ln">8848 </span></a><span class="s0">If they must dance, they had better dance at Randalls.  He had never</span>
<a name="l8849"><span class="ln">8849 </span></a><span class="s0">been in the room at the Crown in his life--did not know the people</span>
<a name="l8850"><span class="ln">8850 </span></a><span class="s0">who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a very bad plan.  They would catch</span>
<a name="l8851"><span class="ln">8851 </span></a><span class="s0">worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8852"><span class="ln">8852 </span></a>
<a name="l8853"><span class="ln">8853 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I was going to observe, sir,&quot; said Frank Churchill,</span>
<a name="l8854"><span class="ln">8854 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;that one of the great recommendations of this change would</span>
<a name="l8855"><span class="ln">8855 </span></a><span class="s0">be the very little danger of any body's catching cold--</span>
<a name="l8856"><span class="ln">8856 </span></a><span class="s0">so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls!  Mr. Perry</span>
<a name="l8857"><span class="ln">8857 </span></a><span class="s0">might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8858"><span class="ln">8858 </span></a>
<a name="l8859"><span class="ln">8859 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Sir,&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, &quot;you are very much</span>
<a name="l8860"><span class="ln">8860 </span></a><span class="s0">mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character.</span>
<a name="l8861"><span class="ln">8861 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill.  But I</span>
<a name="l8862"><span class="ln">8862 </span></a><span class="s0">do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you</span>
<a name="l8863"><span class="ln">8863 </span></a><span class="s0">than your father's house.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8864"><span class="ln">8864 </span></a>
<a name="l8865"><span class="ln">8865 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir.  We shall have</span>
<a name="l8866"><span class="ln">8866 </span></a><span class="s0">no occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening;</span>
<a name="l8867"><span class="ln">8867 </span></a><span class="s0">and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold</span>
<a name="l8868"><span class="ln">8868 </span></a><span class="s0">air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8869"><span class="ln">8869 </span></a>
<a name="l8870"><span class="ln">8870 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think</span>
<a name="l8871"><span class="ln">8871 </span></a><span class="s0">of opening the windows at Randalls.  Nobody could be so imprudent!</span>
<a name="l8872"><span class="ln">8872 </span></a><span class="s0">I never heard of such a thing.  Dancing with open windows!--I am sure,</span>
<a name="l8873"><span class="ln">8873 </span></a><span class="s0">neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was)</span>
<a name="l8874"><span class="ln">8874 </span></a><span class="s0">would suffer it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8875"><span class="ln">8875 </span></a>
<a name="l8876"><span class="ln">8876 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind</span>
<a name="l8877"><span class="ln">8877 </span></a><span class="s0">a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected.</span>
<a name="l8878"><span class="ln">8878 </span></a><span class="s0">I have often known it done myself.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8879"><span class="ln">8879 </span></a>
<a name="l8880"><span class="ln">8880 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me!  I never could have supposed it.</span>
<a name="l8881"><span class="ln">8881 </span></a><span class="s0">But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear.</span>
<a name="l8882"><span class="ln">8882 </span></a><span class="s0">However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come</span>
<a name="l8883"><span class="ln">8883 </span></a><span class="s0">to talk it over--but these sort of things require a good deal</span>
<a name="l8884"><span class="ln">8884 </span></a><span class="s0">of consideration.  One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.</span>
<a name="l8885"><span class="ln">8885 </span></a><span class="s0">If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning,</span>
<a name="l8886"><span class="ln">8886 </span></a><span class="s0">we may talk it over, and see what can be done.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8887"><span class="ln">8887 </span></a>
<a name="l8888"><span class="ln">8888 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--&quot;</span>
<a name="l8889"><span class="ln">8889 </span></a>
<a name="l8890"><span class="ln">8890 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!&quot; interrupted Emma, &quot;there will be plenty of time for talking</span>
<a name="l8891"><span class="ln">8891 </span></a><span class="s0">every thing over.  There is no hurry at all.  If it can be contrived</span>
<a name="l8892"><span class="ln">8892 </span></a><span class="s0">to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses.</span>
<a name="l8893"><span class="ln">8893 </span></a><span class="s0">They will be so near their own stable.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8894"><span class="ln">8894 </span></a>
<a name="l8895"><span class="ln">8895 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So they will, my dear.  That is a great thing.  Not that James</span>
<a name="l8896"><span class="ln">8896 </span></a><span class="s0">ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can.</span>
<a name="l8897"><span class="ln">8897 </span></a><span class="s0">If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is</span>
<a name="l8898"><span class="ln">8898 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Stokes to be trusted?  I doubt it.  I do not know her,</span>
<a name="l8899"><span class="ln">8899 </span></a><span class="s0">even by sight.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8900"><span class="ln">8900 </span></a>
<a name="l8901"><span class="ln">8901 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will</span>
<a name="l8902"><span class="ln">8902 </span></a><span class="s0">be under Mrs. Weston's care.  Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct</span>
<a name="l8903"><span class="ln">8903 </span></a><span class="s0">the whole.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8904"><span class="ln">8904 </span></a>
<a name="l8905"><span class="ln">8905 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l8906"><span class="ln">8906 </span></a><span class="s0">who is carefulness itself.  Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said,</span>
<a name="l8907"><span class="ln">8907 </span></a><span class="s0">so many years ago, when I had the measles?  `If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes</span>
<a name="l8908"><span class="ln">8908 </span></a><span class="s0">to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.'  How often</span>
<a name="l8909"><span class="ln">8909 </span></a><span class="s0">have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!&quot;</span>
<a name="l8910"><span class="ln">8910 </span></a>
<a name="l8911"><span class="ln">8911 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Aye, very true.  Mr. Perry did say so.  I shall never forget it.</span>
<a name="l8912"><span class="ln">8912 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor little Emma!  You were very bad with the measles; that is,</span>
<a name="l8913"><span class="ln">8913 </span></a><span class="s0">you would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention.</span>
<a name="l8914"><span class="ln">8914 </span></a><span class="s0">He came four times a day for a week.  He said, from the first,</span>
<a name="l8915"><span class="ln">8915 </span></a><span class="s0">it was a very good sort--which was our great comfort; but the measles</span>
<a name="l8916"><span class="ln">8916 </span></a><span class="s0">are a dreadful complaint.  I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones</span>
<a name="l8917"><span class="ln">8917 </span></a><span class="s0">have the measles, she will send for Perry.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8918"><span class="ln">8918 </span></a>
<a name="l8919"><span class="ln">8919 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,&quot;</span>
<a name="l8920"><span class="ln">8920 </span></a><span class="s0">said Frank Churchill, &quot;examining the capabilities of the house.</span>
<a name="l8921"><span class="ln">8921 </span></a><span class="s0">I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion,</span>
<a name="l8922"><span class="ln">8922 </span></a><span class="s0">and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice</span>
<a name="l8923"><span class="ln">8923 </span></a><span class="s0">on the spot.  I was desired to say so from both.  It would be the</span>
<a name="l8924"><span class="ln">8924 </span></a><span class="s0">greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there.</span>
<a name="l8925"><span class="ln">8925 </span></a><span class="s0">They can do nothing satisfactorily without you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8926"><span class="ln">8926 </span></a>
<a name="l8927"><span class="ln">8927 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,</span>
<a name="l8928"><span class="ln">8928 </span></a><span class="s0">engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young</span>
<a name="l8929"><span class="ln">8929 </span></a><span class="s0">people set off together without delay for the Crown.  There were</span>
<a name="l8930"><span class="ln">8930 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation,</span>
<a name="l8931"><span class="ln">8931 </span></a><span class="s0">very busy and very happy in their different way; she, in some</span>
<a name="l8932"><span class="ln">8932 </span></a><span class="s0">little distress; and he, finding every thing perfect.</span>
<a name="l8933"><span class="ln">8933 </span></a>
<a name="l8934"><span class="ln">8934 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Emma,&quot; said she, &quot;this paper is worse than I expected.</span>
<a name="l8935"><span class="ln">8935 </span></a><span class="s0">Look! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot</span>
<a name="l8936"><span class="ln">8936 </span></a><span class="s0">is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8937"><span class="ln">8937 </span></a>
<a name="l8938"><span class="ln">8938 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear, you are too particular,&quot; said her husband.  &quot;What does</span>
<a name="l8939"><span class="ln">8939 </span></a><span class="s0">all that signify?  You will see nothing of it by candlelight.</span>
<a name="l8940"><span class="ln">8940 </span></a><span class="s0">It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight.  We never see any</span>
<a name="l8941"><span class="ln">8941 </span></a><span class="s0">thing of it on our club-nights.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8942"><span class="ln">8942 </span></a>
<a name="l8943"><span class="ln">8943 </span></a><span class="s0">The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, &quot;Men never</span>
<a name="l8944"><span class="ln">8944 </span></a><span class="s0">know when things are dirty or not;&quot; and the gentlemen perhaps</span>
<a name="l8945"><span class="ln">8945 </span></a><span class="s0">thought each to himself, &quot;Women will have their little nonsenses</span>
<a name="l8946"><span class="ln">8946 </span></a><span class="s0">and needless cares.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8947"><span class="ln">8947 </span></a>
<a name="l8948"><span class="ln">8948 </span></a><span class="s0">One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.</span>
<a name="l8949"><span class="ln">8949 </span></a><span class="s0">It regarded a supper-room.  At the time of the ballroom's being built,</span>
<a name="l8950"><span class="ln">8950 </span></a><span class="s0">suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining,</span>
<a name="l8951"><span class="ln">8951 </span></a><span class="s0">was the only addition.  What was to be done?  This card-room would</span>
<a name="l8952"><span class="ln">8952 </span></a><span class="s0">be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted</span>
<a name="l8953"><span class="ln">8953 </span></a><span class="s0">unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for</span>
<a name="l8954"><span class="ln">8954 </span></a><span class="s0">any comfortable supper?  Another room of much better size might be</span>
<a name="l8955"><span class="ln">8955 </span></a><span class="s0">secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house,</span>
<a name="l8956"><span class="ln">8956 </span></a><span class="s0">and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it.</span>
<a name="l8957"><span class="ln">8957 </span></a><span class="s0">This made a difficulty.  Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts</span>
<a name="l8958"><span class="ln">8958 </span></a><span class="s0">for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the</span>
<a name="l8959"><span class="ln">8959 </span></a><span class="s0">gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded</span>
<a name="l8960"><span class="ln">8960 </span></a><span class="s0">at supper.</span>
<a name="l8961"><span class="ln">8961 </span></a>
<a name="l8962"><span class="ln">8962 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,</span>
<a name="l8963"><span class="ln">8963 </span></a><span class="s0">&amp;c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a</span>
<a name="l8964"><span class="ln">8964 </span></a><span class="s0">wretched suggestion.  A private dance, without sitting down to supper,</span>
<a name="l8965"><span class="ln">8965 </span></a><span class="s0">was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women;</span>
<a name="l8966"><span class="ln">8966 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again.  She then took another</span>
<a name="l8967"><span class="ln">8967 </span></a><span class="s0">line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,</span>
<a name="l8968"><span class="ln">8968 </span></a>
<a name="l8969"><span class="ln">8969 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not think it _is_ so very small.  We shall not be many,</span>
<a name="l8970"><span class="ln">8970 </span></a><span class="s0">you know.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8971"><span class="ln">8971 </span></a>
<a name="l8972"><span class="ln">8972 </span></a><span class="s0">And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps</span>
<a name="l8973"><span class="ln">8973 </span></a><span class="s0">through the passage, was calling out,</span>
<a name="l8974"><span class="ln">8974 </span></a>
<a name="l8975"><span class="ln">8975 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.</span>
<a name="l8976"><span class="ln">8976 </span></a><span class="s0">It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from</span>
<a name="l8977"><span class="ln">8977 </span></a><span class="s0">the stairs.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8978"><span class="ln">8978 </span></a>
<a name="l8979"><span class="ln">8979 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I wish,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, &quot;one could know which arrangement our</span>
<a name="l8980"><span class="ln">8980 </span></a><span class="s0">guests in general would like best.  To do what would be most generally</span>
<a name="l8981"><span class="ln">8981 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8982"><span class="ln">8982 </span></a>
<a name="l8983"><span class="ln">8983 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, very true,&quot; cried Frank, &quot;very true.  You want your neighbours'</span>
<a name="l8984"><span class="ln">8984 </span></a><span class="s0">opinions.  I do not wonder at you.  If one could ascertain what the</span>
<a name="l8985"><span class="ln">8985 </span></a><span class="s0">chief of them--the Coles, for instance.  They are not far off.</span>
<a name="l8986"><span class="ln">8986 </span></a><span class="s0">Shall I call upon them?  Or Miss Bates?  She is still nearer.--</span>
<a name="l8987"><span class="ln">8987 </span></a><span class="s0">And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand</span>
<a name="l8988"><span class="ln">8988 </span></a><span class="s0">the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body.  I think</span>
<a name="l8989"><span class="ln">8989 </span></a><span class="s0">we do want a larger council.  Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates</span>
<a name="l8990"><span class="ln">8990 </span></a><span class="s0">to join us?&quot;</span>
<a name="l8991"><span class="ln">8991 </span></a>
<a name="l8992"><span class="ln">8992 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well--if you please,&quot; said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, &quot;if you</span>
<a name="l8993"><span class="ln">8993 </span></a><span class="s0">think she will be of any use.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8994"><span class="ln">8994 </span></a>
<a name="l8995"><span class="ln">8995 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,&quot; said Emma.</span>
<a name="l8996"><span class="ln">8996 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing.</span>
<a name="l8997"><span class="ln">8997 </span></a><span class="s0">She will not even listen to your questions.  I see no advantage in</span>
<a name="l8998"><span class="ln">8998 </span></a><span class="s0">consulting Miss Bates.&quot;</span>
<a name="l8999"><span class="ln">8999 </span></a>
<a name="l9000"><span class="ln">9000 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing!  I am very fond</span>
<a name="l9001"><span class="ln">9001 </span></a><span class="s0">of hearing Miss Bates talk.  And I need not bring the whole family,</span>
<a name="l9002"><span class="ln">9002 </span></a><span class="s0">you know.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9003"><span class="ln">9003 </span></a>
<a name="l9004"><span class="ln">9004 </span></a><span class="s0">Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed,</span>
<a name="l9005"><span class="ln">9005 </span></a><span class="s0">gave it his decided approbation.</span>
<a name="l9006"><span class="ln">9006 </span></a>
<a name="l9007"><span class="ln">9007 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter</span>
<a name="l9008"><span class="ln">9008 </span></a><span class="s0">at once.  She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know</span>
<a name="l9009"><span class="ln">9009 </span></a><span class="s0">a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties.</span>
<a name="l9010"><span class="ln">9010 </span></a><span class="s0">Fetch Miss Bates.  We are growing a little too nice.  She is</span>
<a name="l9011"><span class="ln">9011 </span></a><span class="s0">a standing lesson of how to be happy.  But fetch them both.</span>
<a name="l9012"><span class="ln">9012 </span></a><span class="s0">Invite them both.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9013"><span class="ln">9013 </span></a>
<a name="l9014"><span class="ln">9014 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Both sir!  Can the old lady?&quot; . . .</span>
<a name="l9015"><span class="ln">9015 </span></a>
<a name="l9016"><span class="ln">9016 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The old lady!  No, the young lady, to be sure.  I shall think you</span>
<a name="l9017"><span class="ln">9017 </span></a><span class="s0">a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9018"><span class="ln">9018 </span></a>
<a name="l9019"><span class="ln">9019 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!  I beg your pardon, sir.  I did not immediately recollect.</span>
<a name="l9020"><span class="ln">9020 </span></a><span class="s0">Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9021"><span class="ln">9021 </span></a><span class="s0">And away he ran.</span>
<a name="l9022"><span class="ln">9022 </span></a>
<a name="l9023"><span class="ln">9023 </span></a><span class="s0">Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,</span>
<a name="l9024"><span class="ln">9024 </span></a><span class="s0">and her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered</span>
<a name="l9025"><span class="ln">9025 </span></a><span class="s0">woman and a good wife, had examined the passage again,</span>
<a name="l9026"><span class="ln">9026 </span></a><span class="s0">and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before--</span>
<a name="l9027"><span class="ln">9027 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision.</span>
<a name="l9028"><span class="ln">9028 </span></a><span class="s0">All the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth.</span>
<a name="l9029"><span class="ln">9029 </span></a><span class="s0">All the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music,</span>
<a name="l9030"><span class="ln">9030 </span></a><span class="s0">tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles</span>
<a name="l9031"><span class="ln">9031 </span></a><span class="s0">to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.--</span>
<a name="l9032"><span class="ln">9032 </span></a><span class="s0">Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already written</span>
<a name="l9033"><span class="ln">9033 </span></a><span class="s0">to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,</span>
<a name="l9034"><span class="ln">9034 </span></a><span class="s0">which could not possibly be refused.  And a delightful dance it was</span>
<a name="l9035"><span class="ln">9035 </span></a><span class="s0">to be.</span>
<a name="l9036"><span class="ln">9036 </span></a>
<a name="l9037"><span class="ln">9037 </span></a><span class="s0">Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.</span>
<a name="l9038"><span class="ln">9038 </span></a><span class="s0">As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much</span>
<a name="l9039"><span class="ln">9039 </span></a><span class="s0">safer character,) she was truly welcome.  Her approbation, at once</span>
<a name="l9040"><span class="ln">9040 </span></a><span class="s0">general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please;</span>
<a name="l9041"><span class="ln">9041 </span></a><span class="s0">and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro,</span>
<a name="l9042"><span class="ln">9042 </span></a><span class="s0">between the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending,</span>
<a name="l9043"><span class="ln">9043 </span></a><span class="s0">and all in happy enjoyment of the future.  The party did not break</span>
<a name="l9044"><span class="ln">9044 </span></a><span class="s0">up without Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances</span>
<a name="l9045"><span class="ln">9045 </span></a><span class="s0">by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston</span>
<a name="l9046"><span class="ln">9046 </span></a><span class="s0">whisper to his wife, &quot;He has asked her, my dear.  That's right.</span>
<a name="l9047"><span class="ln">9047 </span></a><span class="s0">I knew he would!&quot;</span>
<a name="l9048"><span class="ln">9048 </span></a>
<a name="l9049"><span class="ln">9049 </span></a>
<a name="l9050"><span class="ln">9050 </span></a>
<a name="l9051"><span class="ln">9051 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER XII</span>
<a name="l9052"><span class="ln">9052 </span></a>
<a name="l9053"><span class="ln">9053 </span></a>
<a name="l9054"><span class="ln">9054 </span></a><span class="s0">One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball</span>
<a name="l9055"><span class="ln">9055 </span></a><span class="s0">completely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within</span>
<a name="l9056"><span class="ln">9056 </span></a><span class="s0">the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite</span>
<a name="l9057"><span class="ln">9057 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Weston's confidence, she could not think it so very impossible</span>
<a name="l9058"><span class="ln">9058 </span></a><span class="s0">that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain</span>
<a name="l9059"><span class="ln">9059 </span></a><span class="s0">a day beyond his fortnight.  But this was not judged feasible.</span>
<a name="l9060"><span class="ln">9060 </span></a><span class="s0">The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly</span>
<a name="l9061"><span class="ln">9061 </span></a><span class="s0">ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they</span>
<a name="l9062"><span class="ln">9062 </span></a><span class="s0">must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--</span>
<a name="l9063"><span class="ln">9063 </span></a><span class="s0">in her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.</span>
<a name="l9064"><span class="ln">9064 </span></a>
<a name="l9065"><span class="ln">9065 </span></a><span class="s0">Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word.</span>
<a name="l9066"><span class="ln">9066 </span></a><span class="s0">His wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was</span>
<a name="l9067"><span class="ln">9067 </span></a><span class="s0">not opposed.  All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one</span>
<a name="l9068"><span class="ln">9068 </span></a><span class="s0">solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain</span>
<a name="l9069"><span class="ln">9069 </span></a><span class="s0">of her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's</span>
<a name="l9070"><span class="ln">9070 </span></a><span class="s0">provoking indifference about it.  Either because he did not</span>
<a name="l9071"><span class="ln">9071 </span></a><span class="s0">dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his</span>
<a name="l9072"><span class="ln">9072 </span></a><span class="s0">being consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him,</span>
<a name="l9073"><span class="ln">9073 </span></a><span class="s0">determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording</span>
<a name="l9074"><span class="ln">9074 </span></a><span class="s0">him any future amusement.  To her voluntary communications Emma</span>
<a name="l9075"><span class="ln">9075 </span></a><span class="s0">could get no more approving reply, than,</span>
<a name="l9076"><span class="ln">9076 </span></a>
<a name="l9077"><span class="ln">9077 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very well.  If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this</span>
<a name="l9078"><span class="ln">9078 </span></a><span class="s0">trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing</span>
<a name="l9079"><span class="ln">9079 </span></a><span class="s0">to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--</span>
<a name="l9080"><span class="ln">9080 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep</span>
<a name="l9081"><span class="ln">9081 </span></a><span class="s0">as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over</span>
<a name="l9082"><span class="ln">9082 </span></a><span class="s0">William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess.--</span>
<a name="l9083"><span class="ln">9083 </span></a><span class="s0">Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--</span>
<a name="l9084"><span class="ln">9084 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue,</span>
<a name="l9085"><span class="ln">9085 </span></a><span class="s0">must be its own reward.  Those who are standing by are usually</span>
<a name="l9086"><span class="ln">9086 </span></a><span class="s0">thinking of something very different.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9087"><span class="ln">9087 </span></a>
<a name="l9088"><span class="ln">9088 </span></a><span class="s0">This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry.</span>
<a name="l9089"><span class="ln">9089 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was</span>
<a name="l9090"><span class="ln">9090 </span></a><span class="s0">so indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings</span>
<a name="l9091"><span class="ln">9091 </span></a><span class="s0">in reprobating the ball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it</span>
<a name="l9092"><span class="ln">9092 </span></a><span class="s0">to an extraordinary degree.  It made her animated--open hearted--</span>
<a name="l9093"><span class="ln">9093 </span></a><span class="s0">she voluntarily said;--</span>
<a name="l9094"><span class="ln">9094 </span></a>
<a name="l9095"><span class="ln">9095 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.</span>
<a name="l9096"><span class="ln">9096 </span></a><span class="s0">What a disappointment it would be!  I do look forward to it, I own,</span>
<a name="l9097"><span class="ln">9097 </span></a><span class="s0">with _very_ great pleasure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9098"><span class="ln">9098 </span></a>
<a name="l9099"><span class="ln">9099 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have</span>
<a name="l9100"><span class="ln">9100 </span></a><span class="s0">preferred the society of William Larkins.  No!--she was more and more</span>
<a name="l9101"><span class="ln">9101 </span></a><span class="s0">convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise.</span>
<a name="l9102"><span class="ln">9102 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment</span>
<a name="l9103"><span class="ln">9103 </span></a><span class="s0">on his side--but no love.</span>
<a name="l9104"><span class="ln">9104 </span></a>
<a name="l9105"><span class="ln">9105 </span></a><span class="s0">Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l9106"><span class="ln">9106 </span></a><span class="s0">Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the</span>
<a name="l9107"><span class="ln">9107 </span></a><span class="s0">over-throw of every thing.  A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill</span>
<a name="l9108"><span class="ln">9108 </span></a><span class="s0">to urge his nephew's instant return.  Mrs. Churchill was unwell--</span>
<a name="l9109"><span class="ln">9109 </span></a><span class="s0">far too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering</span>
<a name="l9110"><span class="ln">9110 </span></a><span class="s0">state (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days before,</span>
<a name="l9111"><span class="ln">9111 </span></a><span class="s0">though from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant</span>
<a name="l9112"><span class="ln">9112 </span></a><span class="s0">habit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it;</span>
<a name="l9113"><span class="ln">9113 </span></a><span class="s0">but now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off</span>
<a name="l9114"><span class="ln">9114 </span></a><span class="s0">for Enscombe without delay.</span>
<a name="l9115"><span class="ln">9115 </span></a>
<a name="l9116"><span class="ln">9116 </span></a><span class="s0">The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note</span>
<a name="l9117"><span class="ln">9117 </span></a><span class="s0">from Mrs. Weston, instantly.  As to his going, it was inevitable.</span>
<a name="l9118"><span class="ln">9118 </span></a><span class="s0">He must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real</span>
<a name="l9119"><span class="ln">9119 </span></a><span class="s0">alarm for his aunt, to lessen his repugnance.  He knew her illnesses;</span>
<a name="l9120"><span class="ln">9120 </span></a><span class="s0">they never occurred but for her own convenience.</span>
<a name="l9121"><span class="ln">9121 </span></a>
<a name="l9122"><span class="ln">9122 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston added, &quot;that he could only allow himself time to</span>
<a name="l9123"><span class="ln">9123 </span></a><span class="s0">hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few</span>
<a name="l9124"><span class="ln">9124 </span></a><span class="s0">friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him;</span>
<a name="l9125"><span class="ln">9125 </span></a><span class="s0">and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9126"><span class="ln">9126 </span></a>
<a name="l9127"><span class="ln">9127 </span></a><span class="s0">This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast.  When once</span>
<a name="l9128"><span class="ln">9128 </span></a><span class="s0">it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament</span>
<a name="l9129"><span class="ln">9129 </span></a><span class="s0">and exclaim.  The loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--</span>
<a name="l9130"><span class="ln">9130 </span></a><span class="s0">and all that the young man might be feeling!--It was too wretched!--</span>
<a name="l9131"><span class="ln">9131 </span></a><span class="s0">Such a delightful evening as it would have been!--Every body so happy!</span>
<a name="l9132"><span class="ln">9132 </span></a><span class="s0">and she and her partner the happiest!--&quot;I said it would be so,&quot;</span>
<a name="l9133"><span class="ln">9133 </span></a><span class="s0">was the only consolation.</span>
<a name="l9134"><span class="ln">9134 </span></a>
<a name="l9135"><span class="ln">9135 </span></a><span class="s0">Her father's feelings were quite distinct.  He thought principally</span>
<a name="l9136"><span class="ln">9136 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated;</span>
<a name="l9137"><span class="ln">9137 </span></a><span class="s0">and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed;</span>
<a name="l9138"><span class="ln">9138 </span></a><span class="s0">but they would all be safer at home.</span>
<a name="l9139"><span class="ln">9139 </span></a>
<a name="l9140"><span class="ln">9140 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared;</span>
<a name="l9141"><span class="ln">9141 </span></a><span class="s0">but if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful</span>
<a name="l9142"><span class="ln">9142 </span></a><span class="s0">look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him.</span>
<a name="l9143"><span class="ln">9143 </span></a><span class="s0">He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it.  His dejection</span>
<a name="l9144"><span class="ln">9144 </span></a><span class="s0">was most evident.  He sat really lost in thought for the first</span>
<a name="l9145"><span class="ln">9145 </span></a><span class="s0">few minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say,</span>
<a name="l9146"><span class="ln">9146 </span></a>
<a name="l9147"><span class="ln">9147 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9148"><span class="ln">9148 </span></a>
<a name="l9149"><span class="ln">9149 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But you will come again,&quot; said Emma.  &quot;This will not be your only</span>
<a name="l9150"><span class="ln">9150 </span></a><span class="s0">visit to Randalls.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9151"><span class="ln">9151 </span></a>
<a name="l9152"><span class="ln">9152 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able</span>
<a name="l9153"><span class="ln">9153 </span></a><span class="s0">to return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object</span>
<a name="l9154"><span class="ln">9154 </span></a><span class="s0">of all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town</span>
<a name="l9155"><span class="ln">9155 </span></a><span class="s0">this spring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--</span>
<a name="l9156"><span class="ln">9156 </span></a><span class="s0">I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9157"><span class="ln">9157 </span></a>
<a name="l9158"><span class="ln">9158 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Our poor ball must be quite given up.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9159"><span class="ln">9159 </span></a>
<a name="l9160"><span class="ln">9160 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the</span>
<a name="l9161"><span class="ln">9161 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,</span>
<a name="l9162"><span class="ln">9162 </span></a><span class="s0">foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh!  Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l9163"><span class="ln">9163 </span></a><span class="s0">why are you always so right?&quot;</span>
<a name="l9164"><span class="ln">9164 </span></a>
<a name="l9165"><span class="ln">9165 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance.  I would</span>
<a name="l9166"><span class="ln">9166 </span></a><span class="s0">much rather have been merry than wise.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9167"><span class="ln">9167 </span></a>
<a name="l9168"><span class="ln">9168 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If I can come again, we are still to have our ball.  My father</span>
<a name="l9169"><span class="ln">9169 </span></a><span class="s0">depends on it.  Do not forget your engagement.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9170"><span class="ln">9170 </span></a>
<a name="l9171"><span class="ln">9171 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma looked graciously.</span>
<a name="l9172"><span class="ln">9172 </span></a>
<a name="l9173"><span class="ln">9173 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Such a fortnight as it has been!&quot; he continued; &quot;every day more</span>
<a name="l9174"><span class="ln">9174 </span></a><span class="s0">precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making</span>
<a name="l9175"><span class="ln">9175 </span></a><span class="s0">me less fit to bear any other place.  Happy those, who can remain</span>
<a name="l9176"><span class="ln">9176 </span></a><span class="s0">at Highbury!&quot;</span>
<a name="l9177"><span class="ln">9177 </span></a>
<a name="l9178"><span class="ln">9178 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;As you do us such ample justice now,&quot; said Emma, laughing, &quot;I will</span>
<a name="l9179"><span class="ln">9179 </span></a><span class="s0">venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?</span>
<a name="l9180"><span class="ln">9180 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not we rather surpass your expectations?  I am sure we do.</span>
<a name="l9181"><span class="ln">9181 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure you did not much expect to like us.  You would not have been</span>
<a name="l9182"><span class="ln">9182 </span></a><span class="s0">so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9183"><span class="ln">9183 </span></a>
<a name="l9184"><span class="ln">9184 </span></a><span class="s0">He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment,</span>
<a name="l9185"><span class="ln">9185 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was convinced that it had been so.</span>
<a name="l9186"><span class="ln">9186 </span></a>
<a name="l9187"><span class="ln">9187 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And you must be off this very morning?&quot;</span>
<a name="l9188"><span class="ln">9188 </span></a>
<a name="l9189"><span class="ln">9189 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes; my father is to join me here:  we shall walk back together,</span>
<a name="l9190"><span class="ln">9190 </span></a><span class="s0">and I must be off immediately.  I am almost afraid that every moment</span>
<a name="l9191"><span class="ln">9191 </span></a><span class="s0">will bring him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9192"><span class="ln">9192 </span></a>
<a name="l9193"><span class="ln">9193 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and</span>
<a name="l9194"><span class="ln">9194 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates?  How unlucky!  Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind</span>
<a name="l9195"><span class="ln">9195 </span></a><span class="s0">might have strengthened yours.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9196"><span class="ln">9196 </span></a>
<a name="l9197"><span class="ln">9197 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better.</span>
<a name="l9198"><span class="ln">9198 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a right thing to do.  I went in for three minutes, and was</span>
<a name="l9199"><span class="ln">9199 </span></a><span class="s0">detained by Miss Bates's being absent.  She was out; and I felt it</span>
<a name="l9200"><span class="ln">9200 </span></a><span class="s0">impossible not to wait till she came in.  She is a woman that one may,</span>
<a name="l9201"><span class="ln">9201 </span></a><span class="s0">that one _must_ laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight.</span>
<a name="l9202"><span class="ln">9202 </span></a><span class="s0">It was better to pay my visit, then&quot;--</span>
<a name="l9203"><span class="ln">9203 </span></a>
<a name="l9204"><span class="ln">9204 </span></a><span class="s0">He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.</span>
<a name="l9205"><span class="ln">9205 </span></a>
<a name="l9206"><span class="ln">9206 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;In short,&quot; said he, &quot;perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can</span>
<a name="l9207"><span class="ln">9207 </span></a><span class="s0">hardly be quite without suspicion&quot;--</span>
<a name="l9208"><span class="ln">9208 </span></a>
<a name="l9209"><span class="ln">9209 </span></a><span class="s0">He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts.  She hardly</span>
<a name="l9210"><span class="ln">9210 </span></a><span class="s0">knew what to say.  It seemed like the forerunner of something</span>
<a name="l9211"><span class="ln">9211 </span></a><span class="s0">absolutely serious, which she did not wish.  Forcing herself</span>
<a name="l9212"><span class="ln">9212 </span></a><span class="s0">to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,</span>
<a name="l9213"><span class="ln">9213 </span></a>
<a name="l9214"><span class="ln">9214 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then&quot;--</span>
<a name="l9215"><span class="ln">9215 </span></a>
<a name="l9216"><span class="ln">9216 </span></a><span class="s0">He was silent.  She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting</span>
<a name="l9217"><span class="ln">9217 </span></a><span class="s0">on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner.</span>
<a name="l9218"><span class="ln">9218 </span></a><span class="s0">She heard him sigh.  It was natural for him to feel that he had</span>
<a name="l9219"><span class="ln">9219 </span></a><span class="s0">_cause_ to sigh.  He could not believe her to be encouraging him.</span>
<a name="l9220"><span class="ln">9220 </span></a><span class="s0">A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more</span>
<a name="l9221"><span class="ln">9221 </span></a><span class="s0">determined manner said,</span>
<a name="l9222"><span class="ln">9222 </span></a>
<a name="l9223"><span class="ln">9223 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be</span>
<a name="l9224"><span class="ln">9224 </span></a><span class="s0">given to Hartfield.  My regard for Hartfield is most warm&quot;--</span>
<a name="l9225"><span class="ln">9225 </span></a>
<a name="l9226"><span class="ln">9226 </span></a><span class="s0">He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--</span>
<a name="l9227"><span class="ln">9227 </span></a><span class="s0">He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say</span>
<a name="l9228"><span class="ln">9228 </span></a><span class="s0">how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?</span>
<a name="l9229"><span class="ln">9229 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made</span>
<a name="l9230"><span class="ln">9230 </span></a><span class="s0">him composed.</span>
<a name="l9231"><span class="ln">9231 </span></a>
<a name="l9232"><span class="ln">9232 </span></a><span class="s0">A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial.</span>
<a name="l9233"><span class="ln">9233 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as</span>
<a name="l9234"><span class="ln">9234 </span></a><span class="s0">incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable,</span>
<a name="l9235"><span class="ln">9235 </span></a><span class="s0">as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, &quot;It was time to go;&quot;</span>
<a name="l9236"><span class="ln">9236 </span></a><span class="s0">and the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree,</span>
<a name="l9237"><span class="ln">9237 </span></a><span class="s0">to take leave.</span>
<a name="l9238"><span class="ln">9238 </span></a>
<a name="l9239"><span class="ln">9239 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I shall hear about you all,&quot; said he; &quot;that is my chief consolation.</span>
<a name="l9240"><span class="ln">9240 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you.  I have</span>
<a name="l9241"><span class="ln">9241 </span></a><span class="s0">engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me.  She has been so kind as</span>
<a name="l9242"><span class="ln">9242 </span></a><span class="s0">to promise it.  Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one</span>
<a name="l9243"><span class="ln">9243 </span></a><span class="s0">is really interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing.</span>
<a name="l9244"><span class="ln">9244 </span></a><span class="s0">In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9245"><span class="ln">9245 </span></a>
<a name="l9246"><span class="ln">9246 </span></a><span class="s0">A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest &quot;Good-bye,&quot;</span>
<a name="l9247"><span class="ln">9247 </span></a><span class="s0">closed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill.</span>
<a name="l9248"><span class="ln">9248 </span></a><span class="s0">Short had been the notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma</span>
<a name="l9249"><span class="ln">9249 </span></a><span class="s0">felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little</span>
<a name="l9250"><span class="ln">9250 </span></a><span class="s0">society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry,</span>
<a name="l9251"><span class="ln">9251 </span></a><span class="s0">and feeling it too much.</span>
<a name="l9252"><span class="ln">9252 </span></a>
<a name="l9253"><span class="ln">9253 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a sad change.  They had been meeting almost every day</span>
<a name="l9254"><span class="ln">9254 </span></a><span class="s0">since his arrival.  Certainly his being at Randalls had given</span>
<a name="l9255"><span class="ln">9255 </span></a><span class="s0">great spirit to the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea,</span>
<a name="l9256"><span class="ln">9256 </span></a><span class="s0">the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought,</span>

<a name="l9258"><span class="ln">9258 </span></a><span class="s0">It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking</span>
<a name="l9259"><span class="ln">9259 </span></a><span class="s0">from it into the common course of Hartfield days.  To complete every</span>
<a name="l9260"><span class="ln">9260 </span></a><span class="s0">other recommendation, he had _almost_ told her that he loved her.</span>
<a name="l9261"><span class="ln">9261 </span></a><span class="s0">What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to,</span>
<a name="l9262"><span class="ln">9262 </span></a><span class="s0">was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having</span>
<a name="l9263"><span class="ln">9263 </span></a><span class="s0">a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself;</span>
<a name="l9264"><span class="ln">9264 </span></a><span class="s0">and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that</span>
<a name="l9265"><span class="ln">9265 </span></a><span class="s0">she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous</span>
<a name="l9266"><span class="ln">9266 </span></a><span class="s0">determination against it.</span>
<a name="l9267"><span class="ln">9267 </span></a>
<a name="l9268"><span class="ln">9268 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I certainly must,&quot; said she.  &quot;This sensation of listlessness,</span>
<a name="l9269"><span class="ln">9269 </span></a><span class="s0">weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,</span>
<a name="l9270"><span class="ln">9270 </span></a><span class="s0">this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--</span>
<a name="l9271"><span class="ln">9271 </span></a><span class="s0">I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I</span>
<a name="l9272"><span class="ln">9272 </span></a><span class="s0">were not--for a few weeks at least.  Well! evil to some is always</span>
<a name="l9273"><span class="ln">9273 </span></a><span class="s0">good to others.  I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball,</span>
<a name="l9274"><span class="ln">9274 </span></a><span class="s0">if not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy.</span>
<a name="l9275"><span class="ln">9275 </span></a><span class="s0">He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9276"><span class="ln">9276 </span></a>
<a name="l9277"><span class="ln">9277 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness.  He could</span>
<a name="l9278"><span class="ln">9278 </span></a><span class="s0">not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look</span>
<a name="l9279"><span class="ln">9279 </span></a><span class="s0">would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily,</span>
<a name="l9280"><span class="ln">9280 </span></a><span class="s0">that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with</span>
<a name="l9281"><span class="ln">9281 </span></a><span class="s0">considerable kindness added,</span>
<a name="l9282"><span class="ln">9282 </span></a>
<a name="l9283"><span class="ln">9283 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really</span>
<a name="l9284"><span class="ln">9284 </span></a><span class="s0">out of luck; you are very much out of luck!&quot;</span>
<a name="l9285"><span class="ln">9285 </span></a>
<a name="l9286"><span class="ln">9286 </span></a><span class="s0">It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her</span>
<a name="l9287"><span class="ln">9287 </span></a><span class="s0">honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet,</span>
<a name="l9288"><span class="ln">9288 </span></a><span class="s0">her composure was odious.  She had been particularly unwell, however,</span>
<a name="l9289"><span class="ln">9289 </span></a><span class="s0">suffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare,</span>
<a name="l9290"><span class="ln">9290 </span></a><span class="s0">that had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane could have</span>
<a name="l9291"><span class="ln">9291 </span></a><span class="s0">attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming</span>
<a name="l9292"><span class="ln">9292 </span></a><span class="s0">indifference to the languor of ill-health.</span>
<a name="l9293"><span class="ln">9293 </span></a>

<a name="l9297"><span class="ln">9297 </span></a>
<a name="l9298"><span class="ln">9298 </span></a>
<a name="l9299"><span class="ln">9299 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love.  Her ideas</span>
<a name="l9300"><span class="ln">9300 </span></a><span class="s0">only varied as to the how much.  At first, she thought it was a good deal;</span>
<a name="l9301"><span class="ln">9301 </span></a><span class="s0">and afterwards, but little.  She had great pleasure in hearing Frank</span>
<a name="l9302"><span class="ln">9302 </span></a><span class="s0">Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever</span>
<a name="l9303"><span class="ln">9303 </span></a><span class="s0">in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,</span>
<a name="l9304"><span class="ln">9304 </span></a><span class="s0">and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was,</span>
<a name="l9305"><span class="ln">9305 </span></a><span class="s0">how were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance</span>
<a name="l9306"><span class="ln">9306 </span></a><span class="s0">of his coming to Randalls again this spring.  But, on the other hand,</span>
<a name="l9307"><span class="ln">9307 </span></a><span class="s0">she could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the</span>
<a name="l9308"><span class="ln">9308 </span></a><span class="s0">first morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual;</span>
<a name="l9309"><span class="ln">9309 </span></a><span class="s0">she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could</span>
<a name="l9310"><span class="ln">9310 </span></a><span class="s0">yet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him</span>
<a name="l9311"><span class="ln">9311 </span></a><span class="s0">so much, and, as she sat drawing or working, forming a thousand</span>
<a name="l9312"><span class="ln">9312 </span></a><span class="s0">amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment,</span>
<a name="l9313"><span class="ln">9313 </span></a><span class="s0">fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters;</span>
<a name="l9314"><span class="ln">9314 </span></a><span class="s0">the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she</span>
<a name="l9315"><span class="ln">9315 </span></a><span class="s0">_refused_ _him_.  Their affection was always to subside into friendship.</span>
<a name="l9316"><span class="ln">9316 </span></a><span class="s0">Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting;</span>
<a name="l9317"><span class="ln">9317 </span></a><span class="s0">but still they were to part.  When she became sensible of this,</span>
<a name="l9318"><span class="ln">9318 </span></a><span class="s0">it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite</span>
<a name="l9319"><span class="ln">9319 </span></a><span class="s0">of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father,</span>
<a name="l9320"><span class="ln">9320 </span></a><span class="s0">never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more</span>
<a name="l9321"><span class="ln">9321 </span></a><span class="s0">of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.</span>
<a name="l9322"><span class="ln">9322 </span></a>
<a name="l9323"><span class="ln">9323 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,&quot; said she.--</span>
<a name="l9324"><span class="ln">9324 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives,</span>
<a name="l9325"><span class="ln">9325 </span></a><span class="s0">is there any allusion to making a sacrifice.  I do suspect that he</span>
<a name="l9326"><span class="ln">9326 </span></a><span class="s0">is not really necessary to my happiness.  So much the better.</span>
<a name="l9327"><span class="ln">9327 </span></a><span class="s0">I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do.  I am</span>
<a name="l9328"><span class="ln">9328 </span></a><span class="s0">quite enough in love.  I should be sorry to be more.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9329"><span class="ln">9329 </span></a>
<a name="l9330"><span class="ln">9330 </span></a><span class="s0">Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.</span>
<a name="l9331"><span class="ln">9331 </span></a>
<a name="l9332"><span class="ln">9332 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very much</span>
<a name="l9333"><span class="ln">9333 </span></a><span class="s0">in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection continue,</span>
<a name="l9334"><span class="ln">9334 </span></a><span class="s0">I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most</span>
<a name="l9335"><span class="ln">9335 </span></a><span class="s0">inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up.</span>
<a name="l9336"><span class="ln">9336 </span></a><span class="s0">Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto.</span>
<a name="l9337"><span class="ln">9337 </span></a><span class="s0">No, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would</span>
<a name="l9338"><span class="ln">9338 </span></a><span class="s0">not have been so wretched.  Could he have thought himself encouraged,</span>
<a name="l9339"><span class="ln">9339 </span></a><span class="s0">his looks and language at parting would have been different.--</span>
<a name="l9340"><span class="ln">9340 </span></a><span class="s0">Still, however, I must be on my guard.  This is in the supposition</span>
<a name="l9341"><span class="ln">9341 </span></a><span class="s0">of his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know that I</span>
<a name="l9342"><span class="ln">9342 </span></a><span class="s0">expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man--</span>
<a name="l9343"><span class="ln">9343 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.--</span>
<a name="l9344"><span class="ln">9344 </span></a><span class="s0">His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.--</span>
<a name="l9345"><span class="ln">9345 </span></a><span class="s0">Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful</span>
<a name="l9346"><span class="ln">9346 </span></a><span class="s0">that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well</span>
<a name="l9347"><span class="ln">9347 </span></a><span class="s0">again after a little while--and then, it will be a good thing over;</span>
<a name="l9348"><span class="ln">9348 </span></a><span class="s0">for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall</span>
<a name="l9349"><span class="ln">9349 </span></a><span class="s0">have been let off easily.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9350"><span class="ln">9350 </span></a>
<a name="l9351"><span class="ln">9351 </span></a><span class="s0">When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it;</span>
<a name="l9352"><span class="ln">9352 </span></a><span class="s0">and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made</span>
<a name="l9353"><span class="ln">9353 </span></a><span class="s0">her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she</span>
<a name="l9354"><span class="ln">9354 </span></a><span class="s0">had undervalued their strength.  It was a long, well-written letter,</span>
<a name="l9355"><span class="ln">9355 </span></a><span class="s0">giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings,</span>
<a name="l9356"><span class="ln">9356 </span></a><span class="s0">expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was</span>
<a name="l9357"><span class="ln">9357 </span></a><span class="s0">natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local</span>
<a name="l9358"><span class="ln">9358 </span></a><span class="s0">that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision.</span>
<a name="l9359"><span class="ln">9359 </span></a><span class="s0">No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the</span>
<a name="l9360"><span class="ln">9360 </span></a><span class="s0">language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition</span>
<a name="l9361"><span class="ln">9361 </span></a><span class="s0">from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some</span>
<a name="l9362"><span class="ln">9362 </span></a><span class="s0">of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on</span>
<a name="l9363"><span class="ln">9363 </span></a><span class="s0">to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been</span>
<a name="l9364"><span class="ln">9364 </span></a><span class="s0">said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her own</span>
<a name="l9365"><span class="ln">9365 </span></a><span class="s0">name was not wanting.  _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than once,</span>
<a name="l9366"><span class="ln">9366 </span></a><span class="s0">and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a</span>
<a name="l9367"><span class="ln">9367 </span></a><span class="s0">compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said;</span>
<a name="l9368"><span class="ln">9368 </span></a><span class="s0">and in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it</span>
<a name="l9369"><span class="ln">9369 </span></a><span class="s0">was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern</span>
<a name="l9370"><span class="ln">9370 </span></a><span class="s0">the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment</span>
<a name="l9371"><span class="ln">9371 </span></a><span class="s0">perhaps of all conveyed.  Compressed into the very lowest vacant</span>
<a name="l9372"><span class="ln">9372 </span></a><span class="s0">corner were these words--&quot;I had not a spare moment on Tuesday,</span>
<a name="l9373"><span class="ln">9373 </span></a><span class="s0">as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend.  Pray make</span>
<a name="l9374"><span class="ln">9374 </span></a><span class="s0">my excuses and adieus to her.&quot;  This, Emma could not doubt, was all</span>
<a name="l9375"><span class="ln">9375 </span></a><span class="s0">for herself.  Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend.</span>
<a name="l9376"><span class="ln">9376 </span></a><span class="s0">His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor</span>
<a name="l9377"><span class="ln">9377 </span></a><span class="s0">better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering,</span>
<a name="l9378"><span class="ln">9378 </span></a><span class="s0">and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for</span>
<a name="l9379"><span class="ln">9379 </span></a><span class="s0">coming to Randalls again.</span>
<a name="l9380"><span class="ln">9380 </span></a>
<a name="l9381"><span class="ln">9381 </span></a><span class="s0">Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the</span>
<a name="l9382"><span class="ln">9382 </span></a><span class="s0">material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up</span>
<a name="l9383"><span class="ln">9383 </span></a><span class="s0">and returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth,</span>
<a name="l9384"><span class="ln">9384 </span></a><span class="s0">that she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn</span>
<a name="l9385"><span class="ln">9385 </span></a><span class="s0">to do without her.  Her intentions were unchanged.  Her resolution</span>
<a name="l9386"><span class="ln">9386 </span></a><span class="s0">of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for</span>
<a name="l9387"><span class="ln">9387 </span></a><span class="s0">his subsequent consolation and happiness.  His recollection of Harriet,</span>
<a name="l9388"><span class="ln">9388 </span></a><span class="s0">and the words which clothed it, the &quot;beautiful little friend,&quot;</span>
<a name="l9389"><span class="ln">9389 </span></a><span class="s0">suggested to her the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections.</span>
<a name="l9390"><span class="ln">9390 </span></a><span class="s0">Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his</span>
<a name="l9391"><span class="ln">9391 </span></a><span class="s0">inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with</span>
<a name="l9392"><span class="ln">9392 </span></a><span class="s0">the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner;</span>
<a name="l9393"><span class="ln">9393 </span></a><span class="s0">and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in</span>
<a name="l9394"><span class="ln">9394 </span></a><span class="s0">her favour.--For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.</span>
<a name="l9395"><span class="ln">9395 </span></a>
<a name="l9396"><span class="ln">9396 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I must not dwell upon it,&quot; said she.--&quot;I must not think of it.</span>
<a name="l9397"><span class="ln">9397 </span></a><span class="s0">I know the danger of indulging such speculations.  But stranger</span>
<a name="l9398"><span class="ln">9398 </span></a><span class="s0">things have happened; and when we cease to care for each other</span>
<a name="l9399"><span class="ln">9399 </span></a><span class="s0">as we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort</span>
<a name="l9400"><span class="ln">9400 </span></a><span class="s0">of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward</span>
<a name="l9401"><span class="ln">9401 </span></a><span class="s0">to with pleasure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9402"><span class="ln">9402 </span></a>
<a name="l9403"><span class="ln">9403 </span></a><span class="s0">It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf,</span>
<a name="l9404"><span class="ln">9404 </span></a><span class="s0">though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil</span>
<a name="l9405"><span class="ln">9405 </span></a><span class="s0">in that quarter was at hand.  As Frank Churchill's arrival had</span>
<a name="l9406"><span class="ln">9406 </span></a><span class="s0">succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury,</span>
<a name="l9407"><span class="ln">9407 </span></a><span class="s0">as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now</span>
<a name="l9408"><span class="ln">9408 </span></a><span class="s0">upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were</span>
<a name="l9409"><span class="ln">9409 </span></a><span class="s0">assuming the most irresistible form.--His wedding-day was named.</span>
<a name="l9410"><span class="ln">9410 </span></a><span class="s0">He would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride.</span>
<a name="l9411"><span class="ln">9411 </span></a><span class="s0">There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe</span>
<a name="l9412"><span class="ln">9412 </span></a><span class="s0">before &quot;Mr. Elton and his bride&quot; was in every body's mouth,</span>
<a name="l9413"><span class="ln">9413 </span></a><span class="s0">and Frank Churchill was forgotten.  Emma grew sick at the sound.</span>
<a name="l9414"><span class="ln">9414 </span></a><span class="s0">She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton;</span>
<a name="l9415"><span class="ln">9415 </span></a><span class="s0">and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately</span>
<a name="l9416"><span class="ln">9416 </span></a><span class="s0">gaining strength.  With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least,</span>
<a name="l9417"><span class="ln">9417 </span></a><span class="s0">there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things;</span>
<a name="l9418"><span class="ln">9418 </span></a><span class="s0">but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state</span>
<a name="l9419"><span class="ln">9419 </span></a><span class="s0">of composure as could stand against the actual approach--new carriage,</span>
<a name="l9420"><span class="ln">9420 </span></a><span class="s0">bell-ringing, and all.</span>
<a name="l9421"><span class="ln">9421 </span></a>
<a name="l9422"><span class="ln">9422 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the</span>
<a name="l9423"><span class="ln">9423 </span></a><span class="s0">reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma</span>
<a name="l9424"><span class="ln">9424 </span></a><span class="s0">could give.  Emma felt that she could not do too much for her,</span>
<a name="l9425"><span class="ln">9425 </span></a><span class="s0">that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience;</span>
<a name="l9426"><span class="ln">9426 </span></a><span class="s0">but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing</span>
<a name="l9427"><span class="ln">9427 </span></a><span class="s0">any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions</span>
<a name="l9428"><span class="ln">9428 </span></a><span class="s0">the same.  Harriet listened submissively, and said &quot;it was very true--</span>
<a name="l9429"><span class="ln">9429 </span></a><span class="s0">it was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to</span>
<a name="l9430"><span class="ln">9430 </span></a><span class="s0">think about them--and she would not think about them any longer&quot;</span>
<a name="l9431"><span class="ln">9431 </span></a><span class="s0">but no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour</span>
<a name="l9432"><span class="ln">9432 </span></a><span class="s0">saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before.</span>
<a name="l9433"><span class="ln">9433 </span></a><span class="s0">At last Emma attacked her on another ground.</span>
<a name="l9434"><span class="ln">9434 </span></a>
<a name="l9435"><span class="ln">9435 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about</span>
<a name="l9436"><span class="ln">9436 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can</span>
<a name="l9437"><span class="ln">9437 </span></a><span class="s0">make _me_.  You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I</span>
<a name="l9438"><span class="ln">9438 </span></a><span class="s0">fell into.  It was all my doing, I know.  I have not forgotten it,</span>
<a name="l9439"><span class="ln">9439 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--</span>
<a name="l9440"><span class="ln">9440 </span></a><span class="s0">and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever.  Do not imagine</span>
<a name="l9441"><span class="ln">9441 </span></a><span class="s0">me in danger of forgetting it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9442"><span class="ln">9442 </span></a>
<a name="l9443"><span class="ln">9443 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words</span>
<a name="l9444"><span class="ln">9444 </span></a><span class="s0">of eager exclamation.  Emma continued,</span>
<a name="l9445"><span class="ln">9445 </span></a>
<a name="l9446"><span class="ln">9446 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less,</span>
<a name="l9447"><span class="ln">9447 </span></a><span class="s0">talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather,</span>
<a name="l9448"><span class="ln">9448 </span></a><span class="s0">I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important</span>
<a name="l9449"><span class="ln">9449 </span></a><span class="s0">than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration</span>
<a name="l9450"><span class="ln">9450 </span></a><span class="s0">of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour</span>
<a name="l9451"><span class="ln">9451 </span></a><span class="s0">to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit,</span>
<a name="l9452"><span class="ln">9452 </span></a><span class="s0">and restore your tranquillity.  These are the motives which I</span>
<a name="l9453"><span class="ln">9453 </span></a><span class="s0">have been pressing on you.  They are very important--and sorry</span>
<a name="l9454"><span class="ln">9454 </span></a><span class="s0">I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them.</span>
<a name="l9455"><span class="ln">9455 </span></a><span class="s0">My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.  I want</span>
<a name="l9456"><span class="ln">9456 </span></a><span class="s0">you to save yourself from greater pain.  Perhaps I may sometimes</span>
<a name="l9457"><span class="ln">9457 </span></a><span class="s0">have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather</span>
<a name="l9458"><span class="ln">9458 </span></a><span class="s0">what would be kind by me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9459"><span class="ln">9459 </span></a>
<a name="l9460"><span class="ln">9460 </span></a><span class="s0">This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.</span>
<a name="l9461"><span class="ln">9461 </span></a><span class="s0">The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l9462"><span class="ln">9462 </span></a><span class="s0">whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while,</span>
<a name="l9463"><span class="ln">9463 </span></a><span class="s0">and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained</span>
<a name="l9464"><span class="ln">9464 </span></a><span class="s0">powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it</span>
<a name="l9465"><span class="ln">9465 </span></a><span class="s0">very tolerably.</span>
<a name="l9466"><span class="ln">9466 </span></a>
<a name="l9467"><span class="ln">9467 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--</span>
<a name="l9468"><span class="ln">9468 </span></a><span class="s0">Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody</span>
<a name="l9469"><span class="ln">9469 </span></a><span class="s0">as I do for you!--Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!&quot;</span>
<a name="l9470"><span class="ln">9470 </span></a>
<a name="l9471"><span class="ln">9471 </span></a><span class="s0">Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look</span>
<a name="l9472"><span class="ln">9472 </span></a><span class="s0">and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet</span>
<a name="l9473"><span class="ln">9473 </span></a><span class="s0">so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.</span>
<a name="l9474"><span class="ln">9474 </span></a>
<a name="l9475"><span class="ln">9475 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,&quot; said she</span>
<a name="l9476"><span class="ln">9476 </span></a><span class="s0">afterwards to herself.  &quot;There is nothing to be compared to it.</span>
<a name="l9477"><span class="ln">9477 </span></a><span class="s0">Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner,</span>
<a name="l9478"><span class="ln">9478 </span></a><span class="s0">will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction,</span>
<a name="l9479"><span class="ln">9479 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure it will.  It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear</span>
<a name="l9480"><span class="ln">9480 </span></a><span class="s0">father so generally beloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--</span>
<a name="l9481"><span class="ln">9481 </span></a><span class="s0">I have it not--but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is</span>
<a name="l9482"><span class="ln">9482 </span></a><span class="s0">my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives.</span>
<a name="l9483"><span class="ln">9483 </span></a><span class="s0">Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest-headed,</span>
<a name="l9484"><span class="ln">9484 </span></a><span class="s0">longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing.  Oh! the coldness</span>
<a name="l9485"><span class="ln">9485 </span></a><span class="s0">of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such--And for a wife--</span>
<a name="l9486"><span class="ln">9486 </span></a><span class="s0">a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable.  I mention no names;</span>
<a name="l9487"><span class="ln">9487 </span></a><span class="s0">but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!&quot;</span>
<a name="l9488"><span class="ln">9488 </span></a>
<a name="l9489"><span class="ln">9489 </span></a>

<a name="l9491"><span class="ln">9491 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<a name="l9492"><span class="ln">9492 </span></a>
<a name="l9493"><span class="ln">9493 </span></a>
<a name="l9494"><span class="ln">9494 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton was first seen at church:  but though devotion might</span>
<a name="l9495"><span class="ln">9495 </span></a><span class="s0">be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew,</span>
<a name="l9496"><span class="ln">9496 </span></a><span class="s0">and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid,</span>
<a name="l9497"><span class="ln">9497 </span></a><span class="s0">to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty,</span>
<a name="l9498"><span class="ln">9498 </span></a><span class="s0">or not pretty at all.</span>
<a name="l9499"><span class="ln">9499 </span></a>
<a name="l9500"><span class="ln">9500 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety,</span>
<a name="l9501"><span class="ln">9501 </span></a><span class="s0">to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects;</span>
<a name="l9502"><span class="ln">9502 </span></a><span class="s0">and she made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of</span>
<a name="l9503"><span class="ln">9503 </span></a><span class="s0">the business might be gone through as soon as possible.</span>
<a name="l9504"><span class="ln">9504 </span></a>
<a name="l9505"><span class="ln">9505 </span></a><span class="s0">She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room</span>
<a name="l9506"><span class="ln">9506 </span></a><span class="s0">to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago,</span>
<a name="l9507"><span class="ln">9507 </span></a><span class="s0">to lace up her boot, without _recollecting_.  A thousand vexatious</span>
<a name="l9508"><span class="ln">9508 </span></a><span class="s0">thoughts would recur.  Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders;</span>
<a name="l9509"><span class="ln">9509 </span></a><span class="s0">and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be</span>
<a name="l9510"><span class="ln">9510 </span></a><span class="s0">recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather</span>
<a name="l9511"><span class="ln">9511 </span></a><span class="s0">pale and silent.  The visit was of course short; and there was so</span>
<a name="l9512"><span class="ln">9512 </span></a><span class="s0">much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma</span>
<a name="l9513"><span class="ln">9513 </span></a><span class="s0">would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady,</span>
<a name="l9514"><span class="ln">9514 </span></a><span class="s0">and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms</span>
<a name="l9515"><span class="ln">9515 </span></a><span class="s0">of being &quot;elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9516"><span class="ln">9516 </span></a>
<a name="l9517"><span class="ln">9517 </span></a><span class="s0">She did not really like her.  She would not be in a hurry to find fault,</span>
<a name="l9518"><span class="ln">9518 </span></a><span class="s0">but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--</span>
<a name="l9519"><span class="ln">9519 </span></a><span class="s0">She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride,</span>
<a name="l9520"><span class="ln">9520 </span></a><span class="s0">there was too much ease.  Her person was rather good; her face</span>
<a name="l9521"><span class="ln">9521 </span></a><span class="s0">not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner,</span>
<a name="l9522"><span class="ln">9522 </span></a><span class="s0">were elegant.  Emma thought at least it would turn out so.</span>
<a name="l9523"><span class="ln">9523 </span></a>
<a name="l9524"><span class="ln">9524 </span></a><span class="s0">As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would</span>
<a name="l9525"><span class="ln">9525 </span></a><span class="s0">not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners.</span>
<a name="l9526"><span class="ln">9526 </span></a><span class="s0">It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits,</span>
<a name="l9527"><span class="ln">9527 </span></a><span class="s0">and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it.</span>
<a name="l9528"><span class="ln">9528 </span></a><span class="s0">The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes,</span>
<a name="l9529"><span class="ln">9529 </span></a><span class="s0">and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own</span>
<a name="l9530"><span class="ln">9530 </span></a><span class="s0">good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly</span>
<a name="l9531"><span class="ln">9531 </span></a><span class="s0">unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with</span>
<a name="l9532"><span class="ln">9532 </span></a><span class="s0">the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry,</span>
<a name="l9533"><span class="ln">9533 </span></a><span class="s0">and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him</span>
<a name="l9534"><span class="ln">9534 </span></a><span class="s0">to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly,</span>
<a name="l9535"><span class="ln">9535 </span></a><span class="s0">and as little really easy as could be.</span>
<a name="l9536"><span class="ln">9536 </span></a>
<a name="l9537"><span class="ln">9537 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, Miss Woodhouse,&quot; said Harriet, when they had quitted</span>
<a name="l9538"><span class="ln">9538 </span></a><span class="s0">the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin;</span>
<a name="l9539"><span class="ln">9539 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--</span>
<a name="l9540"><span class="ln">9540 </span></a><span class="s0">Is not she very charming?&quot;</span>
<a name="l9541"><span class="ln">9541 </span></a>
<a name="l9542"><span class="ln">9542 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.</span>
<a name="l9543"><span class="ln">9543 </span></a>
<a name="l9544"><span class="ln">9544 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9545"><span class="ln">9545 </span></a>
<a name="l9546"><span class="ln">9546 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9547"><span class="ln">9547 </span></a>
<a name="l9548"><span class="ln">9548 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9549"><span class="ln">9549 </span></a>
<a name="l9550"><span class="ln">9550 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9551"><span class="ln">9551 </span></a>
<a name="l9552"><span class="ln">9552 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune;</span>
<a name="l9553"><span class="ln">9553 </span></a><span class="s0">and she came in his way.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9554"><span class="ln">9554 </span></a>
<a name="l9555"><span class="ln">9555 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I dare say,&quot; returned Harriet, sighing again, &quot;I dare say she</span>
<a name="l9556"><span class="ln">9556 </span></a><span class="s0">was very much attached to him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9557"><span class="ln">9557 </span></a>
<a name="l9558"><span class="ln">9558 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the</span>
<a name="l9559"><span class="ln">9559 </span></a><span class="s0">woman who loves him best.  Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home,</span>
<a name="l9560"><span class="ln">9560 </span></a><span class="s0">and thought this the best offer she was likely to have.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9561"><span class="ln">9561 </span></a>
<a name="l9562"><span class="ln">9562 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Harriet earnestly, &quot;and well she might, nobody could ever</span>
<a name="l9563"><span class="ln">9563 </span></a><span class="s0">have a better.  Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.  And now,</span>
<a name="l9564"><span class="ln">9564 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.</span>
<a name="l9565"><span class="ln">9565 </span></a><span class="s0">He is just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know,</span>
<a name="l9566"><span class="ln">9566 </span></a><span class="s0">it is quite a different thing.  No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need</span>
<a name="l9567"><span class="ln">9567 </span></a><span class="s0">not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery.</span>
<a name="l9568"><span class="ln">9568 </span></a><span class="s0">To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!--</span>
<a name="l9569"><span class="ln">9569 </span></a><span class="s0">She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves.</span>
<a name="l9570"><span class="ln">9570 </span></a><span class="s0">Happy creature!  He called her `Augusta.'  How delightful!&quot;</span>
<a name="l9571"><span class="ln">9571 </span></a>
<a name="l9572"><span class="ln">9572 </span></a><span class="s0">When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind.  She could then</span>
<a name="l9573"><span class="ln">9573 </span></a><span class="s0">see more and judge better.  From Harriet's happening not to be</span>
<a name="l9574"><span class="ln">9574 </span></a><span class="s0">at Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton,</span>
<a name="l9575"><span class="ln">9575 </span></a><span class="s0">she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself,</span>
<a name="l9576"><span class="ln">9576 </span></a><span class="s0">and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite</span>
<a name="l9577"><span class="ln">9577 </span></a><span class="s0">convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well</span>
<a name="l9578"><span class="ln">9578 </span></a><span class="s0">satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance;</span>
<a name="l9579"><span class="ln">9579 </span></a><span class="s0">that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which</span>
<a name="l9580"><span class="ln">9580 </span></a><span class="s0">had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her</span>
<a name="l9581"><span class="ln">9581 </span></a><span class="s0">notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living;</span>
<a name="l9582"><span class="ln">9582 </span></a><span class="s0">that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would</span>
<a name="l9583"><span class="ln">9583 </span></a><span class="s0">certainly do Mr. Elton no good.</span>
<a name="l9584"><span class="ln">9584 </span></a>
<a name="l9585"><span class="ln">9585 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet would have been a better match.  If not wise or refined herself,</span>
<a name="l9586"><span class="ln">9586 </span></a><span class="s0">she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins,</span>
<a name="l9587"><span class="ln">9587 </span></a><span class="s0">it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best</span>
<a name="l9588"><span class="ln">9588 </span></a><span class="s0">of her own set.  The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride</span>
<a name="l9589"><span class="ln">9589 </span></a><span class="s0">of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride</span>
<a name="l9590"><span class="ln">9590 </span></a><span class="s0">of him.</span>
<a name="l9591"><span class="ln">9591 </span></a>
<a name="l9592"><span class="ln">9592 </span></a><span class="s0">The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, &quot;My brother</span>
<a name="l9593"><span class="ln">9593 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Suckling's seat;&quot;--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove.</span>
<a name="l9594"><span class="ln">9594 </span></a><span class="s0">The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the</span>
<a name="l9595"><span class="ln">9595 </span></a><span class="s0">house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably</span>
<a name="l9596"><span class="ln">9596 </span></a><span class="s0">impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she</span>
<a name="l9597"><span class="ln">9597 </span></a><span class="s0">could see or imagine.  &quot;Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite</span>
<a name="l9598"><span class="ln">9598 </span></a><span class="s0">struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size</span>
<a name="l9599"><span class="ln">9599 </span></a><span class="s0">of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l9600"><span class="ln">9600 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton was appealed to.--&quot;Was not it astonishingly like?--</span>
<a name="l9601"><span class="ln">9601 </span></a><span class="s0">She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9602"><span class="ln">9602 </span></a>
<a name="l9603"><span class="ln">9603 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like</span>
<a name="l9604"><span class="ln">9604 </span></a><span class="s0">the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house.</span>
<a name="l9605"><span class="ln">9605 </span></a><span class="s0">I really could not help exclaiming!  I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l9606"><span class="ln">9606 </span></a><span class="s0">it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so</span>
<a name="l9607"><span class="ln">9607 </span></a><span class="s0">extremely partial to as Maple Grove.  I have spent so many happy</span>
<a name="l9608"><span class="ln">9608 </span></a><span class="s0">months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place,</span>
<a name="l9609"><span class="ln">9609 </span></a><span class="s0">undoubtedly.  Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;</span>
<a name="l9610"><span class="ln">9610 </span></a><span class="s0">but to me, it has been quite a home.  Whenever you are transplanted,</span>
<a name="l9611"><span class="ln">9611 </span></a><span class="s0">like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it</span>
<a name="l9612"><span class="ln">9612 </span></a><span class="s0">is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind.</span>
<a name="l9613"><span class="ln">9613 </span></a><span class="s0">I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9614"><span class="ln">9614 </span></a>
<a name="l9615"><span class="ln">9615 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient</span>
<a name="l9616"><span class="ln">9616 </span></a><span class="s0">for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.</span>
<a name="l9617"><span class="ln">9617 </span></a>
<a name="l9618"><span class="ln">9618 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So extremely like Maple Grove!  And it is not merely the house--</span>
<a name="l9619"><span class="ln">9619 </span></a><span class="s0">the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly</span>
<a name="l9620"><span class="ln">9620 </span></a><span class="s0">like.  The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here,</span>
<a name="l9621"><span class="ln">9621 </span></a><span class="s0">and stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn;</span>
<a name="l9622"><span class="ln">9622 </span></a><span class="s0">and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it,</span>
<a name="l9623"><span class="ln">9623 </span></a><span class="s0">which put me so exactly in mind!  My brother and sister will be</span>
<a name="l9624"><span class="ln">9624 </span></a><span class="s0">enchanted with this place.  People who have extensive grounds</span>
<a name="l9625"><span class="ln">9625 </span></a><span class="s0">themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9626"><span class="ln">9626 </span></a>
<a name="l9627"><span class="ln">9627 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment.  She had a great idea</span>
<a name="l9628"><span class="ln">9628 </span></a><span class="s0">that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little</span>
<a name="l9629"><span class="ln">9629 </span></a><span class="s0">for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth</span>
<a name="l9630"><span class="ln">9630 </span></a><span class="s0">while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said</span>
<a name="l9631"><span class="ln">9631 </span></a><span class="s0">in reply,</span>
<a name="l9632"><span class="ln">9632 </span></a>
<a name="l9633"><span class="ln">9633 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think</span>
<a name="l9634"><span class="ln">9634 </span></a><span class="s0">you have overrated Hartfield.  Surry is full of beauties.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9635"><span class="ln">9635 </span></a>
<a name="l9636"><span class="ln">9636 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.  It is the garden of England,</span>
<a name="l9637"><span class="ln">9637 </span></a><span class="s0">you know.  Surry is the garden of England.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9638"><span class="ln">9638 </span></a>
<a name="l9639"><span class="ln">9639 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction.</span>
<a name="l9640"><span class="ln">9640 </span></a><span class="s0">Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England,</span>
<a name="l9641"><span class="ln">9641 </span></a><span class="s0">as well as Surry.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9642"><span class="ln">9642 </span></a>
<a name="l9643"><span class="ln">9643 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, I fancy not,&quot; replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9644"><span class="ln">9644 </span></a><span class="s0">I never heard any county but Surry called so.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9645"><span class="ln">9645 </span></a>
<a name="l9646"><span class="ln">9646 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was silenced.</span>
<a name="l9647"><span class="ln">9647 </span></a>
<a name="l9648"><span class="ln">9648 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring,</span>
<a name="l9649"><span class="ln">9649 </span></a><span class="s0">or summer at farthest,&quot; continued Mrs. Elton; &quot;and that will be</span>
<a name="l9650"><span class="ln">9650 </span></a><span class="s0">our time for exploring.  While they are with us, we shall explore</span>
<a name="l9651"><span class="ln">9651 </span></a><span class="s0">a great deal, I dare say.  They will have their barouche-landau,</span>
<a name="l9652"><span class="ln">9652 </span></a><span class="s0">of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying</span>
<a name="l9653"><span class="ln">9653 </span></a><span class="s0">any thing of _our_ carriage, we should be able to explore the different</span>
<a name="l9654"><span class="ln">9654 </span></a><span class="s0">beauties extremely well.  They would hardly come in their chaise,</span>
<a name="l9655"><span class="ln">9655 </span></a><span class="s0">I think, at that season of the year.  Indeed, when the time draws on,</span>
<a name="l9656"><span class="ln">9656 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau;</span>
<a name="l9657"><span class="ln">9657 </span></a><span class="s0">it will be so very much preferable.  When people come into a beautiful</span>
<a name="l9658"><span class="ln">9658 </span></a><span class="s0">country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes</span>
<a name="l9659"><span class="ln">9659 </span></a><span class="s0">them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond</span>
<a name="l9660"><span class="ln">9660 </span></a><span class="s0">of exploring.  We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer,</span>
<a name="l9661"><span class="ln">9661 </span></a><span class="s0">in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the</span>
<a name="l9662"><span class="ln">9662 </span></a><span class="s0">barouche-landau.  You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose,</span>
<a name="l9663"><span class="ln">9663 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse, every summer?&quot;</span>
<a name="l9664"><span class="ln">9664 </span></a>
<a name="l9665"><span class="ln">9665 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No; not immediately here.  We are rather out of distance of the very</span>
<a name="l9666"><span class="ln">9666 </span></a><span class="s0">striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of;</span>
<a name="l9667"><span class="ln">9667 </span></a><span class="s0">and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed</span>
<a name="l9668"><span class="ln">9668 </span></a><span class="s0">to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9669"><span class="ln">9669 </span></a>
<a name="l9670"><span class="ln">9670 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.</span>
<a name="l9671"><span class="ln">9671 </span></a><span class="s0">Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am.  I was quite</span>
<a name="l9672"><span class="ln">9672 </span></a><span class="s0">a proverb for it at Maple Grove.  Many a time has Selina said,</span>
<a name="l9673"><span class="ln">9673 </span></a><span class="s0">when she has been going to Bristol, `I really cannot get this girl</span>
<a name="l9674"><span class="ln">9674 </span></a><span class="s0">to move from the house.  I absolutely must go in by myself, though I</span>
<a name="l9675"><span class="ln">9675 </span></a><span class="s0">hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion;</span>
<a name="l9676"><span class="ln">9676 </span></a><span class="s0">but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir</span>
<a name="l9677"><span class="ln">9677 </span></a><span class="s0">beyond the park paling.'  Many a time has she said so; and yet I</span>
<a name="l9678"><span class="ln">9678 </span></a><span class="s0">am no advocate for entire seclusion.  I think, on the contrary,</span>
<a name="l9679"><span class="ln">9679 </span></a><span class="s0">when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very</span>
<a name="l9680"><span class="ln">9680 </span></a><span class="s0">bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in</span>
<a name="l9681"><span class="ln">9681 </span></a><span class="s0">a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little.</span>
<a name="l9682"><span class="ln">9682 </span></a><span class="s0">I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--</span>
<a name="l9683"><span class="ln">9683 </span></a><span class="s0">(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must</span>
<a name="l9684"><span class="ln">9684 </span></a><span class="s0">be a great drawback.  Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should.</span>
<a name="l9685"><span class="ln">9685 </span></a><span class="s0">Let me recommend Bath to you.  I assure you I have no doubt of its doing</span>
<a name="l9686"><span class="ln">9686 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse good.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9687"><span class="ln">9687 </span></a>
<a name="l9688"><span class="ln">9688 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving</span>
<a name="l9689"><span class="ln">9689 </span></a><span class="s0">any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown</span>
<a name="l9690"><span class="ln">9690 </span></a><span class="s0">to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be</span>
<a name="l9691"><span class="ln">9691 </span></a><span class="s0">useful now.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9692"><span class="ln">9692 </span></a>
<a name="l9693"><span class="ln">9693 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l9694"><span class="ln">9694 </span></a><span class="s0">where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief</span>
<a name="l9695"><span class="ln">9695 </span></a><span class="s0">they give.  In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it!</span>
<a name="l9696"><span class="ln">9696 </span></a><span class="s0">And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of</span>
<a name="l9697"><span class="ln">9697 </span></a><span class="s0">use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes</span>
<a name="l9698"><span class="ln">9698 </span></a><span class="s0">much depressed.  And as to its recommendations to _you_, I fancy I</span>
<a name="l9699"><span class="ln">9699 </span></a><span class="s0">need not take much pains to dwell on them.  The advantages of Bath</span>
<a name="l9700"><span class="ln">9700 </span></a><span class="s0">to the young are pretty generally understood.  It would be a charming</span>
<a name="l9701"><span class="ln">9701 </span></a><span class="s0">introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could</span>
<a name="l9702"><span class="ln">9702 </span></a><span class="s0">immediately secure you some of the best society in the place.</span>
<a name="l9703"><span class="ln">9703 </span></a><span class="s0">A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my</span>
<a name="l9704"><span class="ln">9704 </span></a><span class="s0">particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided</span>
<a name="l9705"><span class="ln">9705 </span></a><span class="s0">with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions,</span>
<a name="l9706"><span class="ln">9706 </span></a><span class="s0">and would be the very person for you to go into public with.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9707"><span class="ln">9707 </span></a>
<a name="l9708"><span class="ln">9708 </span></a><span class="s0">It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite.</span>
<a name="l9709"><span class="ln">9709 </span></a><span class="s0">The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called</span>
<a name="l9710"><span class="ln">9710 </span></a><span class="s0">an _introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices</span>
<a name="l9711"><span class="ln">9711 </span></a><span class="s0">of a friend of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow,</span>
<a name="l9712"><span class="ln">9712 </span></a><span class="s0">who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--</span>
<a name="l9713"><span class="ln">9713 </span></a><span class="s0">The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!</span>
<a name="l9714"><span class="ln">9714 </span></a>
<a name="l9715"><span class="ln">9715 </span></a><span class="s0">She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could</span>
<a name="l9716"><span class="ln">9716 </span></a><span class="s0">have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; &quot;but their going</span>
<a name="l9717"><span class="ln">9717 </span></a><span class="s0">to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly</span>
<a name="l9718"><span class="ln">9718 </span></a><span class="s0">convinced that the place might suit her better than her father.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9719"><span class="ln">9719 </span></a><span class="s0">And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the</span>
<a name="l9720"><span class="ln">9720 </span></a><span class="s0">subject directly.</span>
<a name="l9721"><span class="ln">9721 </span></a>
<a name="l9722"><span class="ln">9722 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton.  Upon these occasions,</span>
<a name="l9723"><span class="ln">9723 </span></a><span class="s0">a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long</span>
<a name="l9724"><span class="ln">9724 </span></a><span class="s0">known that you are a superior performer.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9725"><span class="ln">9725 </span></a>
<a name="l9726"><span class="ln">9726 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea.</span>
<a name="l9727"><span class="ln">9727 </span></a><span class="s0">A superior performer!--very far from it, I assure you.</span>
<a name="l9728"><span class="ln">9728 </span></a><span class="s0">Consider from how partial a quarter your information came.</span>
<a name="l9729"><span class="ln">9729 </span></a><span class="s0">I am doatingly fond of music--passionately fond;--and my friends</span>
<a name="l9730"><span class="ln">9730 </span></a><span class="s0">say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else,</span>
<a name="l9731"><span class="ln">9731 </span></a><span class="s0">upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree.</span>
<a name="l9732"><span class="ln">9732 </span></a><span class="s0">You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully.  I assure you</span>
<a name="l9733"><span class="ln">9733 </span></a><span class="s0">it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me,</span>
<a name="l9734"><span class="ln">9734 </span></a><span class="s0">to hear what a musical society I am got into.  I absolutely cannot</span>
<a name="l9735"><span class="ln">9735 </span></a><span class="s0">do without music.  It is a necessary of life to me; and having always</span>
<a name="l9736"><span class="ln">9736 </span></a><span class="s0">been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath,</span>
<a name="l9737"><span class="ln">9737 </span></a><span class="s0">it would have been a most serious sacrifice.  I honestly said as much</span>
<a name="l9738"><span class="ln">9738 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing</span>
<a name="l9739"><span class="ln">9739 </span></a><span class="s0">his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable;</span>
<a name="l9740"><span class="ln">9740 </span></a><span class="s0">and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been</span>
<a name="l9741"><span class="ln">9741 </span></a><span class="s0">accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.</span>
<a name="l9742"><span class="ln">9742 </span></a><span class="s0">When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_</span>
<a name="l9743"><span class="ln">9743 </span></a><span class="s0">_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear</span>
<a name="l9744"><span class="ln">9744 </span></a><span class="s0">of retirement.  Blessed with so many resources within myself,</span>
<a name="l9745"><span class="ln">9745 </span></a><span class="s0">the world was not necessary to _me_.  I could do very well without it.</span>
<a name="l9746"><span class="ln">9746 </span></a><span class="s0">To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my</span>
<a name="l9747"><span class="ln">9747 </span></a><span class="s0">resources made me quite independent.  And as to smaller-sized rooms</span>
<a name="l9748"><span class="ln">9748 </span></a><span class="s0">than I had been used to, I really could not give it a thought.</span>
<a name="l9749"><span class="ln">9749 </span></a><span class="s0">I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description.</span>
<a name="l9750"><span class="ln">9750 </span></a><span class="s0">Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I</span>
<a name="l9751"><span class="ln">9751 </span></a><span class="s0">did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,</span>
<a name="l9752"><span class="ln">9752 </span></a><span class="s0">nor were spacious apartments.  `But,' said I, `to be quite honest,</span>
<a name="l9753"><span class="ln">9753 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not think I can live without something of a musical society.</span>
<a name="l9754"><span class="ln">9754 </span></a><span class="s0">I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank</span>
<a name="l9755"><span class="ln">9755 </span></a><span class="s0">to me.'&quot;</span>
<a name="l9756"><span class="ln">9756 </span></a>
<a name="l9757"><span class="ln">9757 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We cannot suppose,&quot; said Emma, smiling, &quot;that Mr. Elton would hesitate</span>
<a name="l9758"><span class="ln">9758 </span></a><span class="s0">to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury;</span>
<a name="l9759"><span class="ln">9759 </span></a><span class="s0">and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than</span>
<a name="l9760"><span class="ln">9760 </span></a><span class="s0">may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9761"><span class="ln">9761 </span></a>
<a name="l9762"><span class="ln">9762 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head.  I am delighted</span>
<a name="l9763"><span class="ln">9763 </span></a><span class="s0">to find myself in such a circle.  I hope we shall have many sweet</span>
<a name="l9764"><span class="ln">9764 </span></a><span class="s0">little concerts together.  I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I</span>
<a name="l9765"><span class="ln">9765 </span></a><span class="s0">must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings</span>
<a name="l9766"><span class="ln">9766 </span></a><span class="s0">at your house, or ours.  Will not it be a good plan?  If _we_</span>
<a name="l9767"><span class="ln">9767 </span></a><span class="s0">exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies.</span>
<a name="l9768"><span class="ln">9768 </span></a><span class="s0">Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_,</span>
<a name="l9769"><span class="ln">9769 </span></a><span class="s0">as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know--</span>
<a name="l9770"><span class="ln">9770 </span></a><span class="s0">there is a sad story against them, in general.  They are but too apt</span>
<a name="l9771"><span class="ln">9771 </span></a><span class="s0">to give up music.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9772"><span class="ln">9772 </span></a>
<a name="l9773"><span class="ln">9773 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can</span>
<a name="l9774"><span class="ln">9774 </span></a><span class="s0">be no danger, surely?&quot;</span>
<a name="l9775"><span class="ln">9775 </span></a>
<a name="l9776"><span class="ln">9776 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,</span>
<a name="l9777"><span class="ln">9777 </span></a><span class="s0">I tremble.  Selina has entirely given up music--never touches</span>
<a name="l9778"><span class="ln">9778 </span></a><span class="s0">the instrument--though she played sweetly.  And the same may be said</span>
<a name="l9779"><span class="ln">9779 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans,</span>
<a name="l9780"><span class="ln">9780 </span></a><span class="s0">now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate.</span>
<a name="l9781"><span class="ln">9781 </span></a><span class="s0">Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright.  I used to be</span>
<a name="l9782"><span class="ln">9782 </span></a><span class="s0">quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend</span>
<a name="l9783"><span class="ln">9783 </span></a><span class="s0">that a married woman has many things to call her attention.</span>
<a name="l9784"><span class="ln">9784 </span></a><span class="s0">I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9785"><span class="ln">9785 </span></a>
<a name="l9786"><span class="ln">9786 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But every thing of that kind,&quot; said Emma, &quot;will soon</span>
<a name="l9787"><span class="ln">9787 </span></a><span class="s0">be in so regular a train--&quot;</span>
<a name="l9788"><span class="ln">9788 </span></a>
<a name="l9789"><span class="ln">9789 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Elton, laughing, &quot;we shall see.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9790"><span class="ln">9790 </span></a>
<a name="l9791"><span class="ln">9791 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music,</span>
<a name="l9792"><span class="ln">9792 </span></a><span class="s0">had nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton</span>
<a name="l9793"><span class="ln">9793 </span></a><span class="s0">chose another subject.</span>
<a name="l9794"><span class="ln">9794 </span></a>
<a name="l9795"><span class="ln">9795 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We have been calling at Randalls,&quot; said she, &quot;and found them</span>
<a name="l9796"><span class="ln">9796 </span></a><span class="s0">both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be.</span>
<a name="l9797"><span class="ln">9797 </span></a><span class="s0">I like them extremely.  Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--</span>
<a name="l9798"><span class="ln">9798 </span></a><span class="s0">quite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you.</span>
<a name="l9799"><span class="ln">9799 </span></a><span class="s0">And _she_ appears so truly good--there is something so motherly</span>
<a name="l9800"><span class="ln">9800 </span></a><span class="s0">and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly.</span>
<a name="l9801"><span class="ln">9801 </span></a><span class="s0">She was your governess, I think?&quot;</span>
<a name="l9802"><span class="ln">9802 </span></a>
<a name="l9803"><span class="ln">9803 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton</span>
<a name="l9804"><span class="ln">9804 </span></a><span class="s0">hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.</span>
<a name="l9805"><span class="ln">9805 </span></a>
<a name="l9806"><span class="ln">9806 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her</span>
<a name="l9807"><span class="ln">9807 </span></a><span class="s0">so very lady-like!  But she is really quite the gentlewoman.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9808"><span class="ln">9808 </span></a>
<a name="l9809"><span class="ln">9809 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mrs. Weston's manners,&quot; said Emma, &quot;were always particularly good.</span>
<a name="l9810"><span class="ln">9810 </span></a><span class="s0">Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest</span>
<a name="l9811"><span class="ln">9811 </span></a><span class="s0">model for any young woman.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9812"><span class="ln">9812 </span></a>
<a name="l9813"><span class="ln">9813 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And who do you think came in while we were there?&quot;</span>
<a name="l9814"><span class="ln">9814 </span></a>
<a name="l9815"><span class="ln">9815 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was quite at a loss.  The tone implied some old acquaintance--</span>
<a name="l9816"><span class="ln">9816 </span></a><span class="s0">and how could she possibly guess?</span>
<a name="l9817"><span class="ln">9817 </span></a>
<a name="l9818"><span class="ln">9818 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Knightley!&quot; continued Mrs. Elton; &quot;Knightley himself!--Was not</span>
<a name="l9819"><span class="ln">9819 </span></a><span class="s0">it lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day,</span>
<a name="l9820"><span class="ln">9820 </span></a><span class="s0">I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a</span>
<a name="l9821"><span class="ln">9821 </span></a><span class="s0">friend of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity.  `My friend Knightley'</span>
<a name="l9822"><span class="ln">9822 </span></a><span class="s0">had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him;</span>
<a name="l9823"><span class="ln">9823 </span></a><span class="s0">and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not</span>
<a name="l9824"><span class="ln">9824 </span></a><span class="s0">be ashamed of his friend.  Knightley is quite the gentleman.</span>
<a name="l9825"><span class="ln">9825 </span></a><span class="s0">I like him very much.  Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9826"><span class="ln">9826 </span></a>
<a name="l9827"><span class="ln">9827 </span></a><span class="s0">Happily, it was now time to be gone.  They were off; and Emma</span>
<a name="l9828"><span class="ln">9828 </span></a><span class="s0">could breathe.</span>
<a name="l9829"><span class="ln">9829 </span></a>
<a name="l9830"><span class="ln">9830 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Insufferable woman!&quot; was her immediate exclamation.  &quot;Worse than I</span>
<a name="l9831"><span class="ln">9831 </span></a><span class="s0">had supposed.  Absolutely insufferable!  Knightley!--I could not</span>
<a name="l9832"><span class="ln">9832 </span></a><span class="s0">have believed it.  Knightley!--never seen him in her life before,</span>
<a name="l9833"><span class="ln">9833 </span></a><span class="s0">and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman!</span>
<a name="l9834"><span class="ln">9834 </span></a><span class="s0">A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_,</span>
<a name="l9835"><span class="ln">9835 </span></a><span class="s0">and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and</span>
<a name="l9836"><span class="ln">9836 </span></a><span class="s0">underbred finery.  Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is</span>
<a name="l9837"><span class="ln">9837 </span></a><span class="s0">a gentleman!  I doubt whether he will return the compliment,</span>
<a name="l9838"><span class="ln">9838 </span></a><span class="s0">and discover her to be a lady.  I could not have believed it!</span>
<a name="l9839"><span class="ln">9839 </span></a><span class="s0">And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club!</span>
<a name="l9840"><span class="ln">9840 </span></a><span class="s0">One would fancy we were bosom friends!  And Mrs. Weston!--</span>
<a name="l9841"><span class="ln">9841 </span></a><span class="s0">Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be</span>
<a name="l9842"><span class="ln">9842 </span></a><span class="s0">a gentlewoman!  Worse and worse.  I never met with her equal.</span>
<a name="l9843"><span class="ln">9843 </span></a><span class="s0">Much beyond my hopes.  Harriet is disgraced by any comparison.</span>
<a name="l9844"><span class="ln">9844 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here?</span>
<a name="l9845"><span class="ln">9845 </span></a><span class="s0">How angry and how diverted he would be!  Ah! there I am--</span>
<a name="l9846"><span class="ln">9846 </span></a><span class="s0">thinking of him directly.  Always the first person to be thought of!</span>
<a name="l9847"><span class="ln">9847 </span></a><span class="s0">How I catch myself out!  Frank Churchill comes as regularly into</span>
<a name="l9848"><span class="ln">9848 </span></a><span class="s0">my mind!&quot;--</span>
<a name="l9849"><span class="ln">9849 </span></a>
<a name="l9850"><span class="ln">9850 </span></a><span class="s0">All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time</span>
<a name="l9851"><span class="ln">9851 </span></a><span class="s0">her father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons'</span>
<a name="l9852"><span class="ln">9852 </span></a><span class="s0">departure, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable</span>
<a name="l9853"><span class="ln">9853 </span></a><span class="s0">of attending.</span>
<a name="l9854"><span class="ln">9854 </span></a>
<a name="l9855"><span class="ln">9855 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; he deliberately began, &quot;considering we never saw</span>
<a name="l9856"><span class="ln">9856 </span></a><span class="s0">her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say</span>
<a name="l9857"><span class="ln">9857 </span></a><span class="s0">she was very much pleased with you.  She speaks a little too quick.</span>
<a name="l9858"><span class="ln">9858 </span></a><span class="s0">A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear.</span>
<a name="l9859"><span class="ln">9859 </span></a><span class="s0">But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks</span>
<a name="l9860"><span class="ln">9860 </span></a><span class="s0">like you and poor Miss Taylor.  However, she seems a very obliging,</span>
<a name="l9861"><span class="ln">9861 </span></a><span class="s0">pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife.</span>
<a name="l9862"><span class="ln">9862 </span></a><span class="s0">Though I think he had better not have married.  I made the best</span>
<a name="l9863"><span class="ln">9863 </span></a><span class="s0">excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton</span>
<a name="l9864"><span class="ln">9864 </span></a><span class="s0">on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course</span>
<a name="l9865"><span class="ln">9865 </span></a><span class="s0">of the summer.  But I ought to have gone before.  Not to wait upon</span>
<a name="l9866"><span class="ln">9866 </span></a><span class="s0">a bride is very remiss.  Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am!</span>
<a name="l9867"><span class="ln">9867 </span></a><span class="s0">But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9868"><span class="ln">9868 </span></a>
<a name="l9869"><span class="ln">9869 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir.  Mr. Elton knows you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9870"><span class="ln">9870 </span></a>
<a name="l9871"><span class="ln">9871 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes:  but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects</span>
<a name="l9872"><span class="ln">9872 </span></a><span class="s0">to her if possible.  It was being very deficient.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9873"><span class="ln">9873 </span></a>
<a name="l9874"><span class="ln">9874 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore</span>
<a name="l9875"><span class="ln">9875 </span></a><span class="s0">why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_?</span>
<a name="l9876"><span class="ln">9876 </span></a><span class="s0">It ought to be no recommendation to _you_.  It is encouraging people</span>
<a name="l9877"><span class="ln">9877 </span></a><span class="s0">to marry if you make so much of them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9878"><span class="ln">9878 </span></a>
<a name="l9879"><span class="ln">9879 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would</span>
<a name="l9880"><span class="ln">9880 </span></a><span class="s0">always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride,</span>
<a name="l9881"><span class="ln">9881 </span></a><span class="s0">especially, is never to be neglected.  More is avowedly due to _her_.</span>
<a name="l9882"><span class="ln">9882 </span></a><span class="s0">A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company,</span>
<a name="l9883"><span class="ln">9883 </span></a><span class="s0">let the others be who they may.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9884"><span class="ln">9884 </span></a>
<a name="l9885"><span class="ln">9885 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know</span>
<a name="l9886"><span class="ln">9886 </span></a><span class="s0">what is.  And I should never have expected you to be lending your</span>
<a name="l9887"><span class="ln">9887 </span></a><span class="s0">sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9888"><span class="ln">9888 </span></a>
<a name="l9889"><span class="ln">9889 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear, you do not understand me.  This is a</span>
<a name="l9890"><span class="ln">9890 </span></a><span class="s0">matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding,</span>
<a name="l9891"><span class="ln">9891 </span></a><span class="s0">and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9892"><span class="ln">9892 </span></a>
<a name="l9893"><span class="ln">9893 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had done.  Her father was growing nervous, and could not</span>
<a name="l9894"><span class="ln">9894 </span></a><span class="s0">understand _her_.  Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences,</span>
<a name="l9895"><span class="ln">9895 </span></a><span class="s0">and long, very long, did they occupy her.</span>
<a name="l9896"><span class="ln">9896 </span></a>
<a name="l9897"><span class="ln">9897 </span></a>

<a name="l9899"><span class="ln">9899 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER XV</span>
<a name="l9900"><span class="ln">9900 </span></a>
<a name="l9901"><span class="ln">9901 </span></a>
<a name="l9902"><span class="ln">9902 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill</span>
<a name="l9903"><span class="ln">9903 </span></a><span class="s0">opinion of Mrs. Elton.  Her observation had been pretty correct.</span>
<a name="l9904"><span class="ln">9904 </span></a><span class="s0">Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview,</span>
<a name="l9905"><span class="ln">9905 </span></a><span class="s0">such she appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming,</span>
<a name="l9906"><span class="ln">9906 </span></a><span class="s0">familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a</span>
<a name="l9907"><span class="ln">9907 </span></a><span class="s0">little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself</span>
<a name="l9908"><span class="ln">9908 </span></a><span class="s0">coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve</span>
<a name="l9909"><span class="ln">9909 </span></a><span class="s0">a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held</span>
<a name="l9910"><span class="ln">9910 </span></a><span class="s0">such a place in society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.</span>
<a name="l9911"><span class="ln">9911 </span></a>
<a name="l9912"><span class="ln">9912 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently</span>
<a name="l9913"><span class="ln">9913 </span></a><span class="s0">from his wife.  He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud.</span>
<a name="l9914"><span class="ln">9914 </span></a><span class="s0">He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such</span>
<a name="l9915"><span class="ln">9915 </span></a><span class="s0">a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal;</span>
<a name="l9916"><span class="ln">9916 </span></a><span class="s0">and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend,</span>
<a name="l9917"><span class="ln">9917 </span></a><span class="s0">or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's</span>
<a name="l9918"><span class="ln">9918 </span></a><span class="s0">good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever</span>
<a name="l9919"><span class="ln">9919 </span></a><span class="s0">and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied;</span>
<a name="l9920"><span class="ln">9920 </span></a><span class="s0">so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it</span>
<a name="l9921"><span class="ln">9921 </span></a><span class="s0">ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her</span>
<a name="l9922"><span class="ln">9922 </span></a><span class="s0">first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being &quot;very</span>
<a name="l9923"><span class="ln">9923 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasant and very elegantly dressed.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9924"><span class="ln">9924 </span></a>
<a name="l9925"><span class="ln">9925 </span></a><span class="s0">In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared</span>
<a name="l9926"><span class="ln">9926 </span></a><span class="s0">at first.  Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably,</span>
<a name="l9927"><span class="ln">9927 </span></a><span class="s0">by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with,</span>
<a name="l9928"><span class="ln">9928 </span></a><span class="s0">she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold</span>
<a name="l9929"><span class="ln">9929 </span></a><span class="s0">and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will</span>
<a name="l9930"><span class="ln">9930 </span></a><span class="s0">which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma's dislike.</span>
<a name="l9931"><span class="ln">9931 </span></a><span class="s0">Her manners, too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet.</span>
<a name="l9932"><span class="ln">9932 </span></a><span class="s0">They were sneering and negligent.  Emma hoped it must rapidly work</span>
<a name="l9933"><span class="ln">9933 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour</span>
<a name="l9934"><span class="ln">9934 </span></a><span class="s0">sunk them both very much.--It was not to be doubted that poor</span>
<a name="l9935"><span class="ln">9935 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve,</span>
<a name="l9936"><span class="ln">9936 </span></a><span class="s0">and her own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable</span>
<a name="l9937"><span class="ln">9937 </span></a><span class="s0">to her and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been</span>
<a name="l9938"><span class="ln">9938 </span></a><span class="s0">given also.  She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.--</span>
<a name="l9939"><span class="ln">9939 </span></a><span class="s0">When they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin</span>
<a name="l9940"><span class="ln">9940 </span></a><span class="s0">abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew</span>
<a name="l9941"><span class="ln">9941 </span></a><span class="s0">in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in contemptuous</span>
<a name="l9942"><span class="ln">9942 </span></a><span class="s0">treatment of Harriet.</span>
<a name="l9943"><span class="ln">9943 </span></a>
<a name="l9944"><span class="ln">9944 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first.</span>
<a name="l9945"><span class="ln">9945 </span></a><span class="s0">Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be</span>
<a name="l9946"><span class="ln">9946 </span></a><span class="s0">supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she</span>
<a name="l9947"><span class="ln">9947 </span></a><span class="s0">was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--</span>
<a name="l9948"><span class="ln">9948 </span></a><span class="s0">but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting</span>
<a name="l9949"><span class="ln">9949 </span></a><span class="s0">to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence,</span>
<a name="l9950"><span class="ln">9950 </span></a><span class="s0">and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's</span>
<a name="l9951"><span class="ln">9951 </span></a><span class="s0">knight-errantry on the subject.--</span>
<a name="l9952"><span class="ln">9952 </span></a>
<a name="l9953"><span class="ln">9953 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite</span>
<a name="l9954"><span class="ln">9954 </span></a><span class="s0">rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature.  So mild</span>
<a name="l9955"><span class="ln">9955 </span></a><span class="s0">and ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she</span>
<a name="l9956"><span class="ln">9956 </span></a><span class="s0">has very extraordinary talents.  I do not scruple to say that she</span>
<a name="l9957"><span class="ln">9957 </span></a><span class="s0">plays extremely well.  I know enough of music to speak decidedly</span>
<a name="l9958"><span class="ln">9958 </span></a><span class="s0">on that point.  Oh! she is absolutely charming!  You will laugh at</span>
<a name="l9959"><span class="ln">9959 </span></a><span class="s0">my warmth--but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--</span>
<a name="l9960"><span class="ln">9960 </span></a><span class="s0">And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l9961"><span class="ln">9961 </span></a><span class="s0">we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her.</span>
<a name="l9962"><span class="ln">9962 </span></a><span class="s0">We must bring her forward.  Such talent as hers must not be suffered</span>

<a name="l9972"><span class="ln">9972 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation</span>
<a name="l9973"><span class="ln">9973 </span></a><span class="s0">and understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell,</span>
<a name="l9974"><span class="ln">9974 </span></a><span class="s0">I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9975"><span class="ln">9975 </span></a>
<a name="l9976"><span class="ln">9976 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement,</span>
<a name="l9977"><span class="ln">9977 </span></a><span class="s0">such obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have</span>
<a name="l9978"><span class="ln">9978 </span></a><span class="s0">enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end!  And I think</span>
<a name="l9979"><span class="ln">9979 </span></a><span class="s0">she feels it.  I am sure she does.  She is very timid and silent.</span>
<a name="l9980"><span class="ln">9980 </span></a><span class="s0">One can see that she feels the want of encouragement.  I like her</span>
<a name="l9981"><span class="ln">9981 </span></a><span class="s0">the better for it.  I must confess it is a recommendation to me.</span>
<a name="l9982"><span class="ln">9982 </span></a><span class="s0">I am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does</span>
<a name="l9983"><span class="ln">9983 </span></a><span class="s0">not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior,</span>
<a name="l9984"><span class="ln">9984 </span></a><span class="s0">it is extremely prepossessing.  Oh!  I assure you, Jane Fairfax</span>
<a name="l9985"><span class="ln">9985 </span></a><span class="s0">is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I</span>
<a name="l9986"><span class="ln">9986 </span></a><span class="s0">can express.&quot;</span>
<a name="l9987"><span class="ln">9987 </span></a>
<a name="l9988"><span class="ln">9988 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any</span>
<a name="l9989"><span class="ln">9989 </span></a><span class="s0">of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known</span>
<a name="l9990"><span class="ln">9990 </span></a><span class="s0">her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than&quot;--</span>
<a name="l9991"><span class="ln">9991 </span></a>
<a name="l9992"><span class="ln">9992 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare</span>
<a name="l9993"><span class="ln">9993 </span></a><span class="s0">to act.  You and I need not be afraid.  If _we_ set the example,</span>
<a name="l9994"><span class="ln">9994 </span></a><span class="s0">many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not</span>
<a name="l9995"><span class="ln">9995 </span></a><span class="s0">our situations.  _We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home,</span>
<a name="l9996"><span class="ln">9996 </span></a><span class="s0">and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of</span>
<a name="l9997"><span class="ln">9997 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be</span>
<a name="l9998"><span class="ln">9998 </span></a><span class="s0">extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner,</span>
<a name="l9999"><span class="ln">9999 </span></a><span class="s0">as could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax</span>
<a name="l10000"><span class="ln">10000 </span></a><span class="s0">to partake of it.  I have no idea of that sort of thing.  It is</span>
<a name="l10001"><span class="ln">10001 </span></a><span class="s0">not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been used to.</span>
<a name="l10002"><span class="ln">10002 </span></a><span class="s0">My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the</span>
<a name="l10003"><span class="ln">10003 </span></a><span class="s0">other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense.</span>
<a name="l10004"><span class="ln">10004 </span></a><span class="s0">Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--</span>
<a name="l10005"><span class="ln">10005 </span></a><span class="s0">for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling,</span>
<a name="l10006"><span class="ln">10006 </span></a><span class="s0">in income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--</span>
<a name="l10007"><span class="ln">10007 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce</span>
<a name="l10008"><span class="ln">10008 </span></a><span class="s0">her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents,</span>
<a name="l10009"><span class="ln">10009 </span></a><span class="s0">and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation.</span>
<a name="l10010"><span class="ln">10010 </span></a><span class="s0">My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt</span>
<a name="l10011"><span class="ln">10011 </span></a><span class="s0">of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her,</span>
<a name="l10012"><span class="ln">10012 </span></a><span class="s0">of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come</span>
<a name="l10013"><span class="ln">10013 </span></a><span class="s0">to us.  I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets</span>
<a name="l10014"><span class="ln">10014 </span></a><span class="s0">a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off,</span>
<a name="l10015"><span class="ln">10015 </span></a><span class="s0">for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is</span>
<a name="l10016"><span class="ln">10016 </span></a><span class="s0">highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they</span>
<a name="l10017"><span class="ln">10017 </span></a><span class="s0">are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in</span>
<a name="l10018"><span class="ln">10018 </span></a><span class="s0">the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10019"><span class="ln">10019 </span></a>
<a name="l10020"><span class="ln">10020 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Poor Jane Fairfax!&quot;--thought Emma.--&quot;You have not deserved this.</span>
<a name="l10021"><span class="ln">10021 </span></a><span class="s0">You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a</span>
<a name="l10022"><span class="ln">10022 </span></a><span class="s0">punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection</span>
<a name="l10023"><span class="ln">10023 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.'  Heavens!  Let me</span>
<a name="l10024"><span class="ln">10024 </span></a><span class="s0">not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--</span>
<a name="l10025"><span class="ln">10025 </span></a><span class="s0">But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness</span>
<a name="l10026"><span class="ln">10026 </span></a><span class="s0">of that woman's tongue!&quot;</span>
<a name="l10027"><span class="ln">10027 </span></a>
<a name="l10028"><span class="ln">10028 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively</span>
<a name="l10029"><span class="ln">10029 </span></a><span class="s0">addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a &quot;dear Miss</span>
<a name="l10030"><span class="ln">10030 </span></a><span class="s0">Woodhouse.&quot;  The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,</span>
<a name="l10031"><span class="ln">10031 </span></a><span class="s0">and she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular</span>
<a name="l10032"><span class="ln">10032 </span></a><span class="s0">friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very</span>
<a name="l10033"><span class="ln">10033 </span></a><span class="s0">active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a</span>
<a name="l10034"><span class="ln">10034 </span></a><span class="s0">general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.</span>
<a name="l10035"><span class="ln">10035 </span></a>
<a name="l10036"><span class="ln">10036 </span></a><span class="s0">She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for</span>
<a name="l10037"><span class="ln">10037 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless</span>
<a name="l10038"><span class="ln">10038 </span></a><span class="s0">simplicity and warmth.  She was quite one of her worthies--</span>
<a name="l10039"><span class="ln">10039 </span></a><span class="s0">the most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished</span>
<a name="l10040"><span class="ln">10040 </span></a><span class="s0">and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered.</span>
<a name="l10041"><span class="ln">10041 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept</span>
<a name="l10042"><span class="ln">10042 </span></a><span class="s0">those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do.</span>
<a name="l10043"><span class="ln">10043 </span></a><span class="s0">She heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons,</span>
<a name="l10044"><span class="ln">10044 </span></a><span class="s0">spending a day with the Eltons!  This was astonishing!--She could not</span>
<a name="l10045"><span class="ln">10045 </span></a><span class="s0">have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax</span>
<a name="l10046"><span class="ln">10046 </span></a><span class="s0">could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.</span>
<a name="l10047"><span class="ln">10047 </span></a>
<a name="l10048"><span class="ln">10048 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She is a riddle, quite a riddle!&quot; said she.--&quot;To chuse to remain</span>
<a name="l10049"><span class="ln">10049 </span></a><span class="s0">here month after month, under privations of every sort!  And now</span>
<a name="l10050"><span class="ln">10050 </span></a><span class="s0">to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury</span>
<a name="l10051"><span class="ln">10051 </span></a><span class="s0">of her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions</span>
<a name="l10052"><span class="ln">10052 </span></a><span class="s0">who have always loved her with such real, generous affection.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10053"><span class="ln">10053 </span></a>
<a name="l10054"><span class="ln">10054 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells</span>
<a name="l10055"><span class="ln">10055 </span></a><span class="s0">were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells</span>
<a name="l10056"><span class="ln">10056 </span></a><span class="s0">had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer,</span>
<a name="l10057"><span class="ln">10057 </span></a><span class="s0">and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there.</span>
<a name="l10058"><span class="ln">10058 </span></a><span class="s0">According to Miss Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had</span>
<a name="l10059"><span class="ln">10059 </span></a><span class="s0">written most pressingly.  Would Jane but go, means were to be found,</span>
<a name="l10060"><span class="ln">10060 </span></a><span class="s0">servants sent, friends contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed</span>
<a name="l10061"><span class="ln">10061 </span></a><span class="s0">to exist; but still she had declined it!</span>
<a name="l10062"><span class="ln">10062 </span></a>
<a name="l10063"><span class="ln">10063 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing</span>
<a name="l10064"><span class="ln">10064 </span></a><span class="s0">this invitation,&quot; was Emma's conclusion.  &quot;She must be under some</span>
<a name="l10065"><span class="ln">10065 </span></a><span class="s0">sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself.</span>
<a name="l10066"><span class="ln">10066 </span></a><span class="s0">There is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--</span>
<a name="l10067"><span class="ln">10067 </span></a><span class="s0">She is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_.  The decree is issued by somebody.</span>
<a name="l10068"><span class="ln">10068 </span></a><span class="s0">But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a</span>
<a name="l10069"><span class="ln">10069 </span></a><span class="s0">separate puzzle.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10070"><span class="ln">10070 </span></a>
<a name="l10071"><span class="ln">10071 </span></a><span class="s0">Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject,</span>
<a name="l10072"><span class="ln">10072 </span></a><span class="s0">before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l10073"><span class="ln">10073 </span></a><span class="s0">ventured this apology for Jane.</span>
<a name="l10074"><span class="ln">10074 </span></a>
<a name="l10075"><span class="ln">10075 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,</span>
<a name="l10076"><span class="ln">10076 </span></a><span class="s0">my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home.</span>
<a name="l10077"><span class="ln">10077 </span></a><span class="s0">Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion,</span>
<a name="l10078"><span class="ln">10078 </span></a><span class="s0">must be very tiresome.  We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits,</span>
<a name="l10079"><span class="ln">10079 </span></a><span class="s0">before we condemn her taste for what she goes to.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10080"><span class="ln">10080 </span></a>
<a name="l10081"><span class="ln">10081 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are right, Mrs. Weston,&quot; said Mr. Knightley warmly, &quot;Miss Fairfax</span>
<a name="l10082"><span class="ln">10082 </span></a><span class="s0">is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.</span>
<a name="l10083"><span class="ln">10083 </span></a><span class="s0">Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have</span>
<a name="l10084"><span class="ln">10084 </span></a><span class="s0">chosen her.  But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives</span>
<a name="l10085"><span class="ln">10085 </span></a><span class="s0">attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10086"><span class="ln">10086 </span></a>
<a name="l10087"><span class="ln">10087 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance;</span>
<a name="l10088"><span class="ln">10088 </span></a><span class="s0">and she was herself struck by his warmth.  With a faint blush,</span>
<a name="l10089"><span class="ln">10089 </span></a><span class="s0">she presently replied,</span>
<a name="l10090"><span class="ln">10090 </span></a>
<a name="l10091"><span class="ln">10091 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined,</span>
<a name="l10092"><span class="ln">10092 </span></a><span class="s0">would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton's</span>
<a name="l10093"><span class="ln">10093 </span></a><span class="s0">invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10094"><span class="ln">10094 </span></a>
<a name="l10095"><span class="ln">10095 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I should not wonder,&quot; said Mrs. Weston, &quot;if Miss Fairfax were to have</span>
<a name="l10096"><span class="ln">10096 </span></a><span class="s0">been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness</span>
<a name="l10097"><span class="ln">10097 </span></a><span class="s0">in accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her.  Poor Miss Bates may</span>
<a name="l10098"><span class="ln">10098 </span></a><span class="s0">very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater</span>
<a name="l10099"><span class="ln">10099 </span></a><span class="s0">appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated,</span>
<a name="l10100"><span class="ln">10100 </span></a><span class="s0">in spite of the very natural wish of a little change.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10101"><span class="ln">10101 </span></a>
<a name="l10102"><span class="ln">10102 </span></a><span class="s0">Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few</span>
<a name="l10103"><span class="ln">10103 </span></a><span class="s0">minutes silence, he said,</span>
<a name="l10104"><span class="ln">10104 </span></a>
<a name="l10105"><span class="ln">10105 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton</span>
<a name="l10106"><span class="ln">10106 </span></a><span class="s0">does not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her.  We all know</span>
<a name="l10107"><span class="ln">10107 </span></a><span class="s0">the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest</span>
<a name="l10108"><span class="ln">10108 </span></a><span class="s0">spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond</span>
<a name="l10109"><span class="ln">10109 </span></a><span class="s0">common civility in our personal intercourse with each other--</span>
<a name="l10110"><span class="ln">10110 </span></a><span class="s0">a something more early implanted.  We cannot give any body the</span>
<a name="l10111"><span class="ln">10111 </span></a><span class="s0">disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before.</span>
<a name="l10112"><span class="ln">10112 </span></a><span class="s0">We feel things differently.  And besides the operation of this,</span>
<a name="l10113"><span class="ln">10113 </span></a><span class="s0">as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes</span>
<a name="l10114"><span class="ln">10114 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner; and that,</span>
<a name="l10115"><span class="ln">10115 </span></a><span class="s0">face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she</span>
<a name="l10116"><span class="ln">10116 </span></a><span class="s0">has a claim to.  Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell</span>
<a name="l10117"><span class="ln">10117 </span></a><span class="s0">in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent</span>
<a name="l10118"><span class="ln">10118 </span></a><span class="s0">her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not</span>
<a name="l10119"><span class="ln">10119 </span></a><span class="s0">in consciousness.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10120"><span class="ln">10120 </span></a>
<a name="l10121"><span class="ln">10121 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,&quot; said Emma.</span>
<a name="l10122"><span class="ln">10122 </span></a><span class="s0">Little Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy</span>
<a name="l10123"><span class="ln">10123 </span></a><span class="s0">made her irresolute what else to say.</span>
<a name="l10124"><span class="ln">10124 </span></a>
<a name="l10125"><span class="ln">10125 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;any body may know how highly I think of her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10126"><span class="ln">10126 </span></a>
<a name="l10127"><span class="ln">10127 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And yet,&quot; said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look,</span>
<a name="l10128"><span class="ln">10128 </span></a><span class="s0">but soon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--</span>
<a name="l10129"><span class="ln">10129 </span></a><span class="s0">she hurried on--&quot;And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself</span>
<a name="l10130"><span class="ln">10130 </span></a><span class="s0">how highly it is.  The extent of your admiration may take you by</span>
<a name="l10131"><span class="ln">10131 </span></a><span class="s0">surprize some day or other.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10132"><span class="ln">10132 </span></a>
<a name="l10133"><span class="ln">10133 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick</span>
<a name="l10134"><span class="ln">10134 </span></a><span class="s0">leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together,</span>
<a name="l10135"><span class="ln">10135 </span></a><span class="s0">or some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,</span>
<a name="l10136"><span class="ln">10136 </span></a>
<a name="l10137"><span class="ln">10137 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand.  Mr. Cole</span>
<a name="l10138"><span class="ln">10138 </span></a><span class="s0">gave me a hint of it six weeks ago.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10139"><span class="ln">10139 </span></a>
<a name="l10140"><span class="ln">10140 </span></a><span class="s0">He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did</span>
<a name="l10141"><span class="ln">10141 </span></a><span class="s0">not herself know what to think.  In a moment he went on--</span>
<a name="l10142"><span class="ln">10142 </span></a>
<a name="l10143"><span class="ln">10143 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That will never be, however, I can assure you.  Miss Fairfax,</span>
<a name="l10144"><span class="ln">10144 </span></a><span class="s0">I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very</span>
<a name="l10145"><span class="ln">10145 </span></a><span class="s0">sure I shall never ask her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10146"><span class="ln">10146 </span></a>
<a name="l10147"><span class="ln">10147 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased</span>
<a name="l10148"><span class="ln">10148 </span></a><span class="s0">enough to exclaim,</span>
<a name="l10149"><span class="ln">10149 </span></a>
<a name="l10150"><span class="ln">10150 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are not vain, Mr. Knightley.  I will say that for you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10151"><span class="ln">10151 </span></a>
<a name="l10152"><span class="ln">10152 </span></a><span class="s0">He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner</span>
<a name="l10153"><span class="ln">10153 </span></a><span class="s0">which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,</span>
<a name="l10154"><span class="ln">10154 </span></a>
<a name="l10155"><span class="ln">10155 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?&quot;</span>
<a name="l10156"><span class="ln">10156 </span></a>
<a name="l10157"><span class="ln">10157 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No indeed I have not.  You have scolded me too much for match-making,</span>
<a name="l10158"><span class="ln">10158 </span></a><span class="s0">for me to presume to take such a liberty with you.  What I said</span>
<a name="l10159"><span class="ln">10159 </span></a><span class="s0">just now, meant nothing.  One says those sort of things, of course,</span>
<a name="l10160"><span class="ln">10160 </span></a><span class="s0">without any idea of a serious meaning.  Oh! no, upon my word I have not</span>
<a name="l10161"><span class="ln">10161 </span></a><span class="s0">the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body.</span>
<a name="l10162"><span class="ln">10162 </span></a><span class="s0">You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way,</span>
<a name="l10163"><span class="ln">10163 </span></a><span class="s0">if you were married.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10164"><span class="ln">10164 </span></a>
<a name="l10165"><span class="ln">10165 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again.  The result of his reverie was,</span>
<a name="l10166"><span class="ln">10166 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will</span>
<a name="l10167"><span class="ln">10167 </span></a><span class="s0">ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way,</span>
<a name="l10168"><span class="ln">10168 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you.&quot;  And soon afterwards, &quot;Jane Fairfax is a very charming</span>
<a name="l10169"><span class="ln">10169 </span></a><span class="s0">young woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect.  She has a fault.</span>
<a name="l10170"><span class="ln">10170 </span></a><span class="s0">She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10171"><span class="ln">10171 </span></a>
<a name="l10172"><span class="ln">10172 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault.</span>
<a name="l10173"><span class="ln">10173 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said she, &quot;and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?&quot;</span>
<a name="l10174"><span class="ln">10174 </span></a>
<a name="l10175"><span class="ln">10175 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, very soon.  He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;</span>
<a name="l10176"><span class="ln">10176 </span></a><span class="s0">he asked my pardon and said no more.  Cole does not want to be wiser</span>
<a name="l10177"><span class="ln">10177 </span></a><span class="s0">or wittier than his neighbours.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10178"><span class="ln">10178 </span></a>
<a name="l10179"><span class="ln">10179 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser</span>
<a name="l10180"><span class="ln">10180 </span></a><span class="s0">and wittier than all the world!  I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--</span>
<a name="l10181"><span class="ln">10181 </span></a><span class="s0">what she calls them!  How can she find any appellation for them,</span>
<a name="l10182"><span class="ln">10182 </span></a><span class="s0">deep enough in familiar vulgarity?  She calls you, Knightley--what can</span>
<a name="l10183"><span class="ln">10183 </span></a><span class="s0">she do for Mr. Cole?  And so I am not to be surprized that Jane</span>
<a name="l10184"><span class="ln">10184 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her.</span>
<a name="l10185"><span class="ln">10185 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me.  I can much more</span>
<a name="l10186"><span class="ln">10186 </span></a><span class="s0">readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates,</span>
<a name="l10187"><span class="ln">10187 </span></a><span class="s0">than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over</span>
<a name="l10188"><span class="ln">10188 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton.  I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's acknowledging herself</span>
<a name="l10189"><span class="ln">10189 </span></a><span class="s0">the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any</span>
<a name="l10190"><span class="ln">10190 </span></a><span class="s0">restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot</span>
<a name="l10191"><span class="ln">10191 </span></a><span class="s0">imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor</span>
<a name="l10192"><span class="ln">10192 </span></a><span class="s0">with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be</span>
<a name="l10193"><span class="ln">10193 </span></a><span class="s0">continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring</span>
<a name="l10194"><span class="ln">10194 </span></a><span class="s0">her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful</span>
<a name="l10195"><span class="ln">10195 </span></a><span class="s0">exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10196"><span class="ln">10196 </span></a>
<a name="l10197"><span class="ln">10197 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Jane Fairfax has feeling,&quot; said Mr. Knightley--&quot;I do not</span>
<a name="l10198"><span class="ln">10198 </span></a><span class="s0">accuse her of want of feeling.  Her sensibilities, I suspect,</span>
<a name="l10199"><span class="ln">10199 </span></a><span class="s0">are strong--and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance,</span>
<a name="l10200"><span class="ln">10200 </span></a><span class="s0">patience, self-controul; but it wants openness.  She is reserved,</span>
<a name="l10201"><span class="ln">10201 </span></a><span class="s0">more reserved, I think, than she used to be--And I love an</span>
<a name="l10202"><span class="ln">10202 </span></a><span class="s0">open temper.  No--till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment,</span>
<a name="l10203"><span class="ln">10203 </span></a><span class="s0">it had never entered my head.  I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with</span>
<a name="l10204"><span class="ln">10204 </span></a><span class="s0">her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10205"><span class="ln">10205 </span></a>
<a name="l10206"><span class="ln">10206 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, Mrs. Weston,&quot; said Emma triumphantly when he left them,</span>
<a name="l10207"><span class="ln">10207 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?&quot;</span>
<a name="l10208"><span class="ln">10208 </span></a>
<a name="l10209"><span class="ln">10209 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied</span>
<a name="l10210"><span class="ln">10210 </span></a><span class="s0">by the idea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder</span>
<a name="l10211"><span class="ln">10211 </span></a><span class="s0">if it were to end in his being so at last.  Do not beat me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10212"><span class="ln">10212 </span></a>
<a name="l10213"><span class="ln">10213 </span></a>

<a name="l10216"><span class="ln">10216 </span></a>
<a name="l10217"><span class="ln">10217 </span></a>
<a name="l10218"><span class="ln">10218 </span></a><span class="s0">Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton,</span>
<a name="l10219"><span class="ln">10219 </span></a><span class="s0">was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage.  Dinner-parties and</span>
<a name="l10220"><span class="ln">10220 </span></a><span class="s0">evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations</span>
<a name="l10221"><span class="ln">10221 </span></a><span class="s0">flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending</span>
<a name="l10222"><span class="ln">10222 </span></a><span class="s0">they were never to have a disengaged day.</span>
<a name="l10223"><span class="ln">10223 </span></a>
<a name="l10224"><span class="ln">10224 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I see how it is,&quot; said she.  &quot;I see what a life I am to lead</span>
<a name="l10225"><span class="ln">10225 </span></a><span class="s0">among you.  Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated.</span>
<a name="l10226"><span class="ln">10226 </span></a><span class="s0">We really seem quite the fashion.  If this is living in the country,</span>
<a name="l10227"><span class="ln">10227 </span></a><span class="s0">it is nothing very formidable.  From Monday next to Saturday,</span>
<a name="l10228"><span class="ln">10228 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer</span>
<a name="l10229"><span class="ln">10229 </span></a><span class="s0">resources than I have, need not have been at a loss.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10230"><span class="ln">10230 </span></a>
<a name="l10231"><span class="ln">10231 </span></a><span class="s0">No invitation came amiss to her.  Her Bath habits made evening-parties</span>
<a name="l10232"><span class="ln">10232 </span></a><span class="s0">perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste</span>
<a name="l10233"><span class="ln">10233 </span></a><span class="s0">for dinners.  She was a little shocked at the want of two</span>
<a name="l10234"><span class="ln">10234 </span></a><span class="s0">drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being</span>
<a name="l10235"><span class="ln">10235 </span></a><span class="s0">no ice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry,</span>
<a name="l10236"><span class="ln">10236 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge</span>
<a name="l10237"><span class="ln">10237 </span></a><span class="s0">of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought</span>
<a name="l10238"><span class="ln">10238 </span></a><span class="s0">to be arranged.  In the course of the spring she must return their</span>
<a name="l10239"><span class="ln">10239 </span></a><span class="s0">civilities by one very superior party--in which her card-tables</span>
<a name="l10240"><span class="ln">10240 </span></a><span class="s0">should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs</span>
<a name="l10241"><span class="ln">10241 </span></a><span class="s0">in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the evening</span>
<a name="l10242"><span class="ln">10242 </span></a><span class="s0">than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round</span>
<a name="l10243"><span class="ln">10243 </span></a><span class="s0">the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.</span>
<a name="l10244"><span class="ln">10244 </span></a>
<a name="l10245"><span class="ln">10245 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner</span>
<a name="l10246"><span class="ln">10246 </span></a><span class="s0">at Hartfield for the Eltons.  They must not do less than others,</span>
<a name="l10247"><span class="ln">10247 </span></a><span class="s0">or she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable</span>
<a name="l10248"><span class="ln">10248 </span></a><span class="s0">of pitiful resentment.  A dinner there must be.  After Emma had</span>
<a name="l10249"><span class="ln">10249 </span></a><span class="s0">talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness,</span>
<a name="l10250"><span class="ln">10250 </span></a><span class="s0">and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom</span>
<a name="l10251"><span class="ln">10251 </span></a><span class="s0">of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding</span>
<a name="l10252"><span class="ln">10252 </span></a><span class="s0">who should do it for him.</span>
<a name="l10253"><span class="ln">10253 </span></a>
<a name="l10254"><span class="ln">10254 </span></a><span class="s0">The persons to be invited, required little thought.  Besides the Eltons,</span>
<a name="l10255"><span class="ln">10255 </span></a><span class="s0">it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course--</span>
<a name="l10256"><span class="ln">10256 </span></a><span class="s0">and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must</span>
<a name="l10257"><span class="ln">10257 </span></a><span class="s0">be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given</span>
<a name="l10258"><span class="ln">10258 </span></a><span class="s0">with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly</span>
<a name="l10259"><span class="ln">10259 </span></a><span class="s0">pleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it.</span>
<a name="l10260"><span class="ln">10260 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She would rather not be in his company more than she could help.</span>
<a name="l10261"><span class="ln">10261 </span></a><span class="s0">She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy</span>
<a name="l10262"><span class="ln">10262 </span></a><span class="s0">wife together, without feeling uncomfortable.  If Miss Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l10263"><span class="ln">10263 </span></a><span class="s0">would not be displeased, she would rather stay at home.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10264"><span class="ln">10264 </span></a><span class="s0">It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it</span>
<a name="l10265"><span class="ln">10265 </span></a><span class="s0">possible enough for wishing.  She was delighted with the fortitude</span>
<a name="l10266"><span class="ln">10266 </span></a><span class="s0">of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to give</span>
<a name="l10267"><span class="ln">10267 </span></a><span class="s0">up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the</span>
<a name="l10268"><span class="ln">10268 </span></a><span class="s0">very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--</span>
<a name="l10269"><span class="ln">10269 </span></a><span class="s0">Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l10270"><span class="ln">10270 </span></a><span class="s0">she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had</span>
<a name="l10271"><span class="ln">10271 </span></a><span class="s0">often been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her.  He had said</span>
<a name="l10272"><span class="ln">10272 </span></a><span class="s0">that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody</span>
<a name="l10273"><span class="ln">10273 </span></a><span class="s0">else paid her.</span>
<a name="l10274"><span class="ln">10274 </span></a>
<a name="l10275"><span class="ln">10275 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This is very true,&quot; said she, &quot;at least as far as relates to me,</span>
<a name="l10276"><span class="ln">10276 </span></a><span class="s0">which was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--</span>
<a name="l10277"><span class="ln">10277 </span></a><span class="s0">and always knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--</span>
<a name="l10278"><span class="ln">10278 </span></a><span class="s0">She will never like me now.  I have neglected her too long.  But I</span>
<a name="l10279"><span class="ln">10279 </span></a><span class="s0">will shew her greater attention than I have done.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10280"><span class="ln">10280 </span></a>
<a name="l10281"><span class="ln">10281 </span></a><span class="s0">Every invitation was successful.  They were all disengaged and all happy.--</span>
<a name="l10282"><span class="ln">10282 </span></a><span class="s0">The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over.</span>
<a name="l10283"><span class="ln">10283 </span></a><span class="s0">A circumstance rather unlucky occurred.  The two eldest little</span>
<a name="l10284"><span class="ln">10284 </span></a><span class="s0">Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of</span>
<a name="l10285"><span class="ln">10285 </span></a><span class="s0">some weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them,</span>
<a name="l10286"><span class="ln">10286 </span></a><span class="s0">and staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be</span>
<a name="l10287"><span class="ln">10287 </span></a><span class="s0">the very day of this party.--His professional engagements did</span>
<a name="l10288"><span class="ln">10288 </span></a><span class="s0">not allow of his being put off, but both father and daughter were</span>
<a name="l10289"><span class="ln">10289 </span></a><span class="s0">disturbed by its happening so.  Mr. Woodhouse considered eight</span>
<a name="l10290"><span class="ln">10290 </span></a><span class="s0">persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear--</span>
<a name="l10291"><span class="ln">10291 </span></a><span class="s0">and here would be a ninth--and Emma apprehended that it would</span>
<a name="l10292"><span class="ln">10292 </span></a><span class="s0">be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even</span>
<a name="l10293"><span class="ln">10293 </span></a><span class="s0">to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party.</span>
<a name="l10294"><span class="ln">10294 </span></a>
<a name="l10295"><span class="ln">10295 </span></a><span class="s0">She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself,</span>
<a name="l10296"><span class="ln">10296 </span></a><span class="s0">by representing that though he certainly would make them nine,</span>
<a name="l10297"><span class="ln">10297 </span></a><span class="s0">yet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be</span>
<a name="l10298"><span class="ln">10298 </span></a><span class="s0">very immaterial.  She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself,</span>
<a name="l10299"><span class="ln">10299 </span></a><span class="s0">to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed</span>
<a name="l10300"><span class="ln">10300 </span></a><span class="s0">to her instead of his brother.</span>
<a name="l10301"><span class="ln">10301 </span></a>
<a name="l10302"><span class="ln">10302 </span></a><span class="s0">The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma.</span>
<a name="l10303"><span class="ln">10303 </span></a><span class="s0">John Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town</span>
<a name="l10304"><span class="ln">10304 </span></a><span class="s0">and must be absent on the very day.  He might be able to join them</span>
<a name="l10305"><span class="ln">10305 </span></a><span class="s0">in the evening, but certainly not to dinner.  Mr. Woodhouse was quite</span>
<a name="l10306"><span class="ln">10306 </span></a><span class="s0">at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys</span>
<a name="l10307"><span class="ln">10307 </span></a><span class="s0">and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate,</span>
<a name="l10308"><span class="ln">10308 </span></a><span class="s0">removed the chief of even Emma's vexation.</span>
<a name="l10309"><span class="ln">10309 </span></a>
<a name="l10310"><span class="ln">10310 </span></a><span class="s0">The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley</span>
<a name="l10311"><span class="ln">10311 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable.</span>
<a name="l10312"><span class="ln">10312 </span></a><span class="s0">Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited</span>
<a name="l10313"><span class="ln">10313 </span></a><span class="s0">for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton, as elegant</span>
<a name="l10314"><span class="ln">10314 </span></a><span class="s0">as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--</span>
<a name="l10315"><span class="ln">10315 </span></a><span class="s0">wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but Miss</span>
<a name="l10316"><span class="ln">10316 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could</span>
<a name="l10317"><span class="ln">10317 </span></a><span class="s0">talk to her.  He had met her before breakfast as he was returning</span>
<a name="l10318"><span class="ln">10318 </span></a><span class="s0">from a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning</span>
<a name="l10319"><span class="ln">10319 </span></a><span class="s0">to rain.  It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject,</span>
<a name="l10320"><span class="ln">10320 </span></a><span class="s0">and he said,</span>
<a name="l10321"><span class="ln">10321 </span></a>
<a name="l10322"><span class="ln">10322 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I</span>
<a name="l10323"><span class="ln">10323 </span></a><span class="s0">am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time.</span>
<a name="l10324"><span class="ln">10324 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope you turned directly.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10325"><span class="ln">10325 </span></a>
<a name="l10326"><span class="ln">10326 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I went only to the post-office,&quot; said she, &quot;and reached home</span>
<a name="l10327"><span class="ln">10327 </span></a><span class="s0">before the rain was much.  It is my daily errand.  I always fetch</span>
<a name="l10328"><span class="ln">10328 </span></a><span class="s0">the letters when I am here.  It saves trouble, and is a something</span>
<a name="l10329"><span class="ln">10329 </span></a><span class="s0">to get me out.  A walk before breakfast does me good.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10330"><span class="ln">10330 </span></a>
<a name="l10331"><span class="ln">10331 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10332"><span class="ln">10332 </span></a>
<a name="l10333"><span class="ln">10333 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10334"><span class="ln">10334 </span></a>
<a name="l10335"><span class="ln">10335 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,</span>
<a name="l10336"><span class="ln">10336 </span></a>
<a name="l10337"><span class="ln">10337 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six</span>
<a name="l10338"><span class="ln">10338 </span></a><span class="s0">yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you;</span>
<a name="l10339"><span class="ln">10339 </span></a><span class="s0">and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.</span>
<a name="l10340"><span class="ln">10340 </span></a><span class="s0">The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives.</span>
<a name="l10341"><span class="ln">10341 </span></a><span class="s0">When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are</span>
<a name="l10342"><span class="ln">10342 </span></a><span class="s0">never worth going through the rain for.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10343"><span class="ln">10343 </span></a>
<a name="l10344"><span class="ln">10344 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a little blush, and then this answer,</span>
<a name="l10345"><span class="ln">10345 </span></a>
<a name="l10346"><span class="ln">10346 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of</span>
<a name="l10347"><span class="ln">10347 </span></a><span class="s0">every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply</span>
<a name="l10348"><span class="ln">10348 </span></a><span class="s0">growing older should make me indifferent about letters.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10349"><span class="ln">10349 </span></a>
<a name="l10350"><span class="ln">10350 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indifferent!  Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.</span>
<a name="l10351"><span class="ln">10351 </span></a><span class="s0">Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very</span>
<a name="l10352"><span class="ln">10352 </span></a><span class="s0">positive curse.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10353"><span class="ln">10353 </span></a>
<a name="l10354"><span class="ln">10354 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters</span>
<a name="l10355"><span class="ln">10355 </span></a><span class="s0">of friendship.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10356"><span class="ln">10356 </span></a>
<a name="l10357"><span class="ln">10357 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have often thought them the worst of the two,&quot; replied he coolly.</span>
<a name="l10358"><span class="ln">10358 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly</span>
<a name="l10359"><span class="ln">10359 </span></a><span class="s0">ever does.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10360"><span class="ln">10360 </span></a>
<a name="l10361"><span class="ln">10361 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! you are not serious now.  I know Mr. John Knightley too well--</span>
<a name="l10362"><span class="ln">10362 </span></a><span class="s0">I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as</span>
<a name="l10363"><span class="ln">10363 </span></a><span class="s0">any body.  I can easily believe that letters are very little to you,</span>
<a name="l10364"><span class="ln">10364 </span></a><span class="s0">much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than</span>
<a name="l10365"><span class="ln">10365 </span></a><span class="s0">myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation.</span>
<a name="l10366"><span class="ln">10366 </span></a><span class="s0">You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably,</span>
<a name="l10367"><span class="ln">10367 </span></a><span class="s0">never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections,</span>
<a name="l10368"><span class="ln">10368 </span></a><span class="s0">a post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out,</span>
<a name="l10369"><span class="ln">10369 </span></a><span class="s0">in worse weather than to-day.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10370"><span class="ln">10370 </span></a>
<a name="l10371"><span class="ln">10371 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,&quot;</span>
<a name="l10372"><span class="ln">10372 </span></a><span class="s0">said John Knightley, &quot;I meant to imply the change of situation</span>
<a name="l10373"><span class="ln">10373 </span></a><span class="s0">which time usually brings.  I consider one as including the other.</span>
<a name="l10374"><span class="ln">10374 </span></a><span class="s0">Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within</span>
<a name="l10375"><span class="ln">10375 </span></a><span class="s0">the daily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you.</span>
<a name="l10376"><span class="ln">10376 </span></a><span class="s0">As an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten</span>
<a name="l10377"><span class="ln">10377 </span></a><span class="s0">years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10378"><span class="ln">10378 </span></a>
<a name="l10379"><span class="ln">10379 </span></a><span class="s0">It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence.  A pleasant</span>
<a name="l10380"><span class="ln">10380 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;thank you&quot; seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip,</span>
<a name="l10381"><span class="ln">10381 </span></a><span class="s0">a tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh.</span>
<a name="l10382"><span class="ln">10382 </span></a><span class="s0">Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being,</span>
<a name="l10383"><span class="ln">10383 </span></a><span class="s0">according to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of</span>
<a name="l10384"><span class="ln">10384 </span></a><span class="s0">his guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies,</span>
<a name="l10385"><span class="ln">10385 </span></a><span class="s0">was ending with her--and with all his mildest urbanity, said,</span>
<a name="l10386"><span class="ln">10386 </span></a>
<a name="l10387"><span class="ln">10387 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this</span>
<a name="l10388"><span class="ln">10388 </span></a><span class="s0">morning in the rain.  Young ladies should take care of themselves.--</span>
<a name="l10389"><span class="ln">10389 </span></a><span class="s0">Young ladies are delicate plants.  They should take care of their</span>
<a name="l10390"><span class="ln">10390 </span></a><span class="s0">health and their complexion.  My dear, did you change your stockings?&quot;</span>
<a name="l10391"><span class="ln">10391 </span></a>
<a name="l10392"><span class="ln">10392 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind</span>
<a name="l10393"><span class="ln">10393 </span></a><span class="s0">solicitude about me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10394"><span class="ln">10394 </span></a>
<a name="l10395"><span class="ln">10395 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--</span>
<a name="l10396"><span class="ln">10396 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well.  They are some</span>
<a name="l10397"><span class="ln">10397 </span></a><span class="s0">of my very old friends.  I wish my health allowed me to be a</span>
<a name="l10398"><span class="ln">10398 </span></a><span class="s0">better neighbour.  You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure.</span>
<a name="l10399"><span class="ln">10399 </span></a><span class="s0">My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness,</span>
<a name="l10400"><span class="ln">10400 </span></a><span class="s0">and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10401"><span class="ln">10401 </span></a>
<a name="l10402"><span class="ln">10402 </span></a><span class="s0">The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel</span>
<a name="l10403"><span class="ln">10403 </span></a><span class="s0">that he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.</span>
<a name="l10404"><span class="ln">10404 </span></a>
<a name="l10405"><span class="ln">10405 </span></a><span class="s0">By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton,</span>
<a name="l10406"><span class="ln">10406 </span></a><span class="s0">and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.</span>
<a name="l10407"><span class="ln">10407 </span></a>
<a name="l10408"><span class="ln">10408 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office</span>
<a name="l10409"><span class="ln">10409 </span></a><span class="s0">in the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl,</span>
<a name="l10410"><span class="ln">10410 </span></a><span class="s0">how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there</span>
<a name="l10411"><span class="ln">10411 </span></a><span class="s0">to take care of you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10412"><span class="ln">10412 </span></a>
<a name="l10413"><span class="ln">10413 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.</span>
<a name="l10414"><span class="ln">10414 </span></a>
<a name="l10415"><span class="ln">10415 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! do not tell _me_.  You really are a very sad girl, and do not</span>
<a name="l10416"><span class="ln">10416 </span></a><span class="s0">know how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed!</span>
<a name="l10417"><span class="ln">10417 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like?  You and I must positively</span>
<a name="l10418"><span class="ln">10418 </span></a><span class="s0">exert our authority.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10419"><span class="ln">10419 </span></a>
<a name="l10420"><span class="ln">10420 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My advice,&quot; said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, &quot;I certainly</span>
<a name="l10421"><span class="ln">10421 </span></a><span class="s0">do feel tempted to give.  Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--</span>
<a name="l10422"><span class="ln">10422 </span></a><span class="s0">Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought</span>
<a name="l10423"><span class="ln">10423 </span></a><span class="s0">to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year.</span>
<a name="l10424"><span class="ln">10424 </span></a><span class="s0">The spring I always think requires more than common care.</span>
<a name="l10425"><span class="ln">10425 </span></a><span class="s0">Better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters,</span>
<a name="l10426"><span class="ln">10426 </span></a><span class="s0">than run the risk of bringing on your cough again.  Now do not you</span>
<a name="l10427"><span class="ln">10427 </span></a><span class="s0">feel that you had?  Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable.</span>
<a name="l10428"><span class="ln">10428 </span></a><span class="s0">You look as if you would not do such a thing again.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10429"><span class="ln">10429 </span></a>
<a name="l10430"><span class="ln">10430 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,&quot; eagerly rejoined</span>
<a name="l10431"><span class="ln">10431 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton.  &quot;We will not allow her to do such a thing again:&quot;--</span>
<a name="l10432"><span class="ln">10432 </span></a><span class="s0">and nodding significantly--&quot;there must be some arrangement made,</span>
<a name="l10433"><span class="ln">10433 </span></a><span class="s0">there must indeed.  I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches</span>
<a name="l10434"><span class="ln">10434 </span></a><span class="s0">our letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name)</span>
<a name="l10435"><span class="ln">10435 </span></a><span class="s0">shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you.  That will obviate</span>
<a name="l10436"><span class="ln">10436 </span></a><span class="s0">all difficulties you know; and from _us_ I really think, my dear Jane,</span>
<a name="l10437"><span class="ln">10437 </span></a><span class="s0">you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10438"><span class="ln">10438 </span></a>
<a name="l10439"><span class="ln">10439 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are extremely kind,&quot; said Jane; &quot;but I cannot give up my</span>
<a name="l10440"><span class="ln">10440 </span></a><span class="s0">early walk.  I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can,</span>
<a name="l10441"><span class="ln">10441 </span></a><span class="s0">I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon</span>
<a name="l10442"><span class="ln">10442 </span></a><span class="s0">my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10443"><span class="ln">10443 </span></a>
<a name="l10444"><span class="ln">10444 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Jane, say no more about it.  The thing is determined,</span>
<a name="l10445"><span class="ln">10445 </span></a><span class="s0">that is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine</span>
<a name="l10446"><span class="ln">10446 </span></a><span class="s0">any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master.  You know,</span>
<a name="l10447"><span class="ln">10447 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves.</span>
<a name="l10448"><span class="ln">10448 </span></a><span class="s0">But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely</span>
<a name="l10449"><span class="ln">10449 </span></a><span class="s0">worn out.  If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore,</span>
<a name="l10450"><span class="ln">10450 </span></a><span class="s0">consider that point as settled.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10451"><span class="ln">10451 </span></a>
<a name="l10452"><span class="ln">10452 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; said Jane earnestly, &quot;I cannot by any means consent</span>
<a name="l10453"><span class="ln">10453 </span></a><span class="s0">to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant.</span>
<a name="l10454"><span class="ln">10454 </span></a><span class="s0">If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it</span>
<a name="l10455"><span class="ln">10455 </span></a><span class="s0">always is when I am not here, by my grandmama's.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10456"><span class="ln">10456 </span></a>
<a name="l10457"><span class="ln">10457 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness</span>
<a name="l10458"><span class="ln">10458 </span></a><span class="s0">to employ our men.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10459"><span class="ln">10459 </span></a>
<a name="l10460"><span class="ln">10460 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead</span>
<a name="l10461"><span class="ln">10461 </span></a><span class="s0">of answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.</span>
<a name="l10462"><span class="ln">10462 </span></a>
<a name="l10463"><span class="ln">10463 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The post-office is a wonderful establishment!&quot; said she.--</span>
<a name="l10464"><span class="ln">10464 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The regularity and despatch of it!  If one thinks of all that it</span>
<a name="l10465"><span class="ln">10465 </span></a><span class="s0">has to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!&quot;</span>
<a name="l10466"><span class="ln">10466 </span></a>
<a name="l10467"><span class="ln">10467 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is certainly very well regulated.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10468"><span class="ln">10468 </span></a>
<a name="l10469"><span class="ln">10469 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears!  So seldom</span>
<a name="l10470"><span class="ln">10470 </span></a><span class="s0">that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing</span>
<a name="l10471"><span class="ln">10471 </span></a><span class="s0">about the kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million,</span>
<a name="l10472"><span class="ln">10472 </span></a><span class="s0">I suppose, actually lost!  And when one considers the variety</span>
<a name="l10473"><span class="ln">10473 </span></a><span class="s0">of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered,</span>
<a name="l10474"><span class="ln">10474 </span></a><span class="s0">it increases the wonder.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10475"><span class="ln">10475 </span></a>
<a name="l10476"><span class="ln">10476 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some</span>
<a name="l10477"><span class="ln">10477 </span></a><span class="s0">quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them.  If you</span>
<a name="l10478"><span class="ln">10478 </span></a><span class="s0">want any farther explanation,&quot; continued he, smiling, &quot;they are</span>
<a name="l10479"><span class="ln">10479 </span></a><span class="s0">paid for it.  That is the key to a great deal of capacity.</span>
<a name="l10480"><span class="ln">10480 </span></a><span class="s0">The public pays and must be served well.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10481"><span class="ln">10481 </span></a>
<a name="l10482"><span class="ln">10482 </span></a><span class="s0">The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual</span>
<a name="l10483"><span class="ln">10483 </span></a><span class="s0">observations made.</span>
<a name="l10484"><span class="ln">10484 </span></a>
<a name="l10485"><span class="ln">10485 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have heard it asserted,&quot; said John Knightley, &quot;that the same</span>
<a name="l10486"><span class="ln">10486 </span></a><span class="s0">sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the</span>
<a name="l10487"><span class="ln">10487 </span></a><span class="s0">same master teaches, it is natural enough.  But for that reason,</span>
<a name="l10488"><span class="ln">10488 </span></a><span class="s0">I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females,</span>
<a name="l10489"><span class="ln">10489 </span></a><span class="s0">for boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble</span>
<a name="l10490"><span class="ln">10490 </span></a><span class="s0">into any hand they can get.  Isabella and Emma, I think, do write</span>
<a name="l10491"><span class="ln">10491 </span></a><span class="s0">very much alike.  I have not always known their writing apart.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10492"><span class="ln">10492 </span></a>
<a name="l10493"><span class="ln">10493 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; said his brother hesitatingly, &quot;there is a likeness.</span>
<a name="l10494"><span class="ln">10494 </span></a><span class="s0">I know what you mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10495"><span class="ln">10495 </span></a>
<a name="l10496"><span class="ln">10496 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,&quot; said Mr. Woodhouse;</span>
<a name="l10497"><span class="ln">10497 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;and always did.  And so does poor Mrs. Weston&quot;--with half a sigh</span>
<a name="l10498"><span class="ln">10498 </span></a><span class="s0">and half a smile at her.</span>
<a name="l10499"><span class="ln">10499 </span></a>
<a name="l10500"><span class="ln">10500 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I never saw any gentleman's handwriting&quot;--Emma began, looking also</span>
<a name="l10501"><span class="ln">10501 </span></a><span class="s0">at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was</span>
<a name="l10502"><span class="ln">10502 </span></a><span class="s0">attending to some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect,</span>
<a name="l10503"><span class="ln">10503 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Now, how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking</span>
<a name="l10504"><span class="ln">10504 </span></a><span class="s0">his name at once before all these people?  Is it necessary</span>
<a name="l10505"><span class="ln">10505 </span></a><span class="s0">for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--</span>
<a name="l10506"><span class="ln">10506 </span></a><span class="s0">your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way, I suppose,</span>
<a name="l10507"><span class="ln">10507 </span></a><span class="s0">if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce his name without the</span>
<a name="l10508"><span class="ln">10508 </span></a><span class="s0">smallest distress.  I certainly get better and better.--Now for it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10509"><span class="ln">10509 </span></a>
<a name="l10510"><span class="ln">10510 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--&quot;Mr. Frank Churchill</span>
<a name="l10511"><span class="ln">10511 </span></a><span class="s0">writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10512"><span class="ln">10512 </span></a>
<a name="l10513"><span class="ln">10513 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not admire it,&quot; said Mr. Knightley.  &quot;It is too small--</span>
<a name="l10514"><span class="ln">10514 </span></a><span class="s0">wants strength.  It is like a woman's writing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10515"><span class="ln">10515 </span></a>
<a name="l10516"><span class="ln">10516 </span></a><span class="s0">This was not submitted to by either lady.  They vindicated him</span>
<a name="l10517"><span class="ln">10517 </span></a><span class="s0">against the base aspersion.  &quot;No, it by no means wanted strength--</span>
<a name="l10518"><span class="ln">10518 </span></a><span class="s0">it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong.</span>
<a name="l10519"><span class="ln">10519 </span></a><span class="s0">Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?&quot;  No, she had</span>
<a name="l10520"><span class="ln">10520 </span></a><span class="s0">heard from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put</span>
<a name="l10521"><span class="ln">10521 </span></a><span class="s0">it away.</span>
<a name="l10522"><span class="ln">10522 </span></a>
<a name="l10523"><span class="ln">10523 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If we were in the other room,&quot; said Emma, &quot;if I had my writing-desk,</span>
<a name="l10524"><span class="ln">10524 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure I could produce a specimen.  I have a note of his.--</span>
<a name="l10525"><span class="ln">10525 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you</span>
<a name="l10526"><span class="ln">10526 </span></a><span class="s0">one day?&quot;</span>
<a name="l10527"><span class="ln">10527 </span></a>
<a name="l10528"><span class="ln">10528 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He chose to say he was employed&quot;--</span>
<a name="l10529"><span class="ln">10529 </span></a>
<a name="l10530"><span class="ln">10530 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner</span>
<a name="l10531"><span class="ln">10531 </span></a><span class="s0">to convince Mr. Knightley.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10532"><span class="ln">10532 </span></a>
<a name="l10533"><span class="ln">10533 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,&quot;</span>
<a name="l10534"><span class="ln">10534 </span></a><span class="s0">said Mr. Knightley dryly, &quot;writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l10535"><span class="ln">10535 </span></a><span class="s0">he will, of course, put forth his best.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10536"><span class="ln">10536 </span></a>
<a name="l10537"><span class="ln">10537 </span></a><span class="s0">Dinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to,</span>
<a name="l10538"><span class="ln">10538 </span></a><span class="s0">was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request</span>
<a name="l10539"><span class="ln">10539 </span></a><span class="s0">to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--</span>
<a name="l10540"><span class="ln">10540 </span></a>
<a name="l10541"><span class="ln">10541 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Must I go first?  I really am ashamed of always leading the way.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10542"><span class="ln">10542 </span></a>
<a name="l10543"><span class="ln">10543 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.</span>
<a name="l10544"><span class="ln">10544 </span></a><span class="s0">She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know</span>
<a name="l10545"><span class="ln">10545 </span></a><span class="s0">whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any.  She suspected</span>
<a name="l10546"><span class="ln">10546 </span></a><span class="s0">that it _had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered</span>
<a name="l10547"><span class="ln">10547 </span></a><span class="s0">but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear,</span>
<a name="l10548"><span class="ln">10548 </span></a><span class="s0">and that it had not been in vain.  She thought there was an air</span>
<a name="l10549"><span class="ln">10549 </span></a><span class="s0">of greater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits.</span>
<a name="l10550"><span class="ln">10550 </span></a>
<a name="l10551"><span class="ln">10551 </span></a><span class="s0">She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition</span>
<a name="l10552"><span class="ln">10552 </span></a><span class="s0">and the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end--</span>
<a name="l10553"><span class="ln">10553 </span></a><span class="s0">but she abstained.  She was quite determined not to utter a word</span>
<a name="l10554"><span class="ln">10554 </span></a><span class="s0">that should hurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed</span>
<a name="l10555"><span class="ln">10555 </span></a><span class="s0">the other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance</span>
<a name="l10556"><span class="ln">10556 </span></a><span class="s0">of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.</span>
<a name="l10557"><span class="ln">10557 </span></a>

<a name="l10561"><span class="ln">10561 </span></a>
<a name="l10562"><span class="ln">10562 </span></a>
<a name="l10563"><span class="ln">10563 </span></a><span class="s0">When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found</span>
<a name="l10564"><span class="ln">10564 </span></a><span class="s0">it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--</span>
<a name="l10565"><span class="ln">10565 </span></a><span class="s0">with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton</span>
<a name="l10566"><span class="ln">10566 </span></a><span class="s0">engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself.  She and Mrs. Weston were</span>
<a name="l10567"><span class="ln">10567 </span></a><span class="s0">obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together.</span>
<a name="l10568"><span class="ln">10568 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton left them no choice.  If Jane repressed her for a</span>
<a name="l10569"><span class="ln">10569 </span></a><span class="s0">little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed</span>
<a name="l10570"><span class="ln">10570 </span></a><span class="s0">between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side,</span>
<a name="l10571"><span class="ln">10571 </span></a><span class="s0">there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects:</span>
<a name="l10572"><span class="ln">10572 </span></a><span class="s0">The post-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship,</span>
<a name="l10573"><span class="ln">10573 </span></a><span class="s0">were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must</span>
<a name="l10574"><span class="ln">10574 </span></a><span class="s0">be at least equally unpleasant to Jane--inquiries whether she had</span>
<a name="l10575"><span class="ln">10575 </span></a><span class="s0">yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of</span>
<a name="l10576"><span class="ln">10576 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.</span>
<a name="l10577"><span class="ln">10577 </span></a>
<a name="l10578"><span class="ln">10578 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Here is April come!&quot; said she, &quot;I get quite anxious about you.</span>
<a name="l10579"><span class="ln">10579 </span></a><span class="s0">June will soon be here.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10580"><span class="ln">10580 </span></a>
<a name="l10581"><span class="ln">10581 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked</span>
<a name="l10582"><span class="ln">10582 </span></a><span class="s0">forward to the summer in general.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10583"><span class="ln">10583 </span></a>
<a name="l10584"><span class="ln">10584 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But have you really heard of nothing?&quot;</span>
<a name="l10585"><span class="ln">10585 </span></a>
<a name="l10586"><span class="ln">10586 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10587"><span class="ln">10587 </span></a>
<a name="l10588"><span class="ln">10588 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware</span>
<a name="l10589"><span class="ln">10589 </span></a><span class="s0">of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10590"><span class="ln">10590 </span></a>
<a name="l10591"><span class="ln">10591 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I not aware!&quot; said Jane, shaking her head; &quot;dear Mrs. Elton,</span>
<a name="l10592"><span class="ln">10592 </span></a><span class="s0">who can have thought of it as I have done?&quot;</span>
<a name="l10593"><span class="ln">10593 </span></a>
<a name="l10594"><span class="ln">10594 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But you have not seen so much of the world as I have.  You do not</span>
<a name="l10595"><span class="ln">10595 </span></a><span class="s0">know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations.</span>
<a name="l10596"><span class="ln">10596 </span></a><span class="s0">I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove.</span>
<a name="l10597"><span class="ln">10597 </span></a><span class="s0">A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity</span>
<a name="l10598"><span class="ln">10598 </span></a><span class="s0">of applications; every body was anxious to be in her family,</span>
<a name="l10599"><span class="ln">10599 </span></a><span class="s0">for she moves in the first circle.  Wax-candles in the schoolroom!</span>
<a name="l10600"><span class="ln">10600 </span></a><span class="s0">You may imagine how desirable!  Of all houses in the kingdom</span>
<a name="l10601"><span class="ln">10601 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see you in.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10602"><span class="ln">10602 </span></a>
<a name="l10603"><span class="ln">10603 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,&quot;</span>
<a name="l10604"><span class="ln">10604 </span></a><span class="s0">said Jane.  &quot;I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will</span>
<a name="l10605"><span class="ln">10605 </span></a><span class="s0">want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself.</span>
<a name="l10606"><span class="ln">10606 </span></a><span class="s0">But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries</span>
<a name="l10607"><span class="ln">10607 </span></a><span class="s0">at present.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10608"><span class="ln">10608 </span></a>
<a name="l10609"><span class="ln">10609 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Trouble! aye, I know your scruples.  You are afraid of giving</span>
<a name="l10610"><span class="ln">10610 </span></a><span class="s0">me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can</span>
<a name="l10611"><span class="ln">10611 </span></a><span class="s0">hardly be more interested about you than I am.  I shall write</span>
<a name="l10612"><span class="ln">10612 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict</span>
<a name="l10613"><span class="ln">10613 </span></a><span class="s0">charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10614"><span class="ln">10614 </span></a>
<a name="l10615"><span class="ln">10615 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject</span>
<a name="l10616"><span class="ln">10616 </span></a><span class="s0">to her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving</span>
<a name="l10617"><span class="ln">10617 </span></a><span class="s0">any body trouble.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10618"><span class="ln">10618 </span></a>
<a name="l10619"><span class="ln">10619 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April,</span>
<a name="l10620"><span class="ln">10620 </span></a><span class="s0">and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business</span>
<a name="l10621"><span class="ln">10621 </span></a><span class="s0">to accomplish before us.  Your inexperience really amuses me!</span>
<a name="l10622"><span class="ln">10622 </span></a><span class="s0">A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you,</span>
<a name="l10623"><span class="ln">10623 </span></a><span class="s0">is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice;</span>
<a name="l10624"><span class="ln">10624 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10625"><span class="ln">10625 </span></a>
<a name="l10626"><span class="ln">10626 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no</span>
<a name="l10627"><span class="ln">10627 </span></a><span class="s0">inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.</span>
<a name="l10628"><span class="ln">10628 </span></a><span class="s0">When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid</span>
<a name="l10629"><span class="ln">10629 </span></a><span class="s0">of being long unemployed.  There are places in town, offices,</span>
<a name="l10630"><span class="ln">10630 </span></a><span class="s0">where inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--</span>
<a name="l10631"><span class="ln">10631 </span></a><span class="s0">not quite of human flesh--but of human intellect.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10632"><span class="ln">10632 </span></a>
<a name="l10633"><span class="ln">10633 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! my dear, human flesh!  You quite shock me; if you mean a fling</span>
<a name="l10634"><span class="ln">10634 </span></a><span class="s0">at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather</span>
<a name="l10635"><span class="ln">10635 </span></a><span class="s0">a friend to the abolition.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10636"><span class="ln">10636 </span></a>
<a name="l10637"><span class="ln">10637 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,&quot; replied Jane;</span>
<a name="l10638"><span class="ln">10638 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;</span>
<a name="l10639"><span class="ln">10639 </span></a><span class="s0">widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on;</span>
<a name="l10640"><span class="ln">10640 </span></a><span class="s0">but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where</span>
<a name="l10641"><span class="ln">10641 </span></a><span class="s0">it lies.  But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices,</span>
<a name="l10642"><span class="ln">10642 </span></a><span class="s0">and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon</span>
<a name="l10643"><span class="ln">10643 </span></a><span class="s0">meeting with something that would do.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10644"><span class="ln">10644 </span></a>
<a name="l10645"><span class="ln">10645 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Something that would do!&quot; repeated Mrs. Elton.  &quot;Aye, _that_ may</span>
<a name="l10646"><span class="ln">10646 </span></a><span class="s0">suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature</span>
<a name="l10647"><span class="ln">10647 </span></a><span class="s0">you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up</span>
<a name="l10648"><span class="ln">10648 </span></a><span class="s0">with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation,</span>
<a name="l10649"><span class="ln">10649 </span></a><span class="s0">in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command</span>

<a name="l10652"><span class="ln">10652 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;</span>
<a name="l10653"><span class="ln">10653 </span></a><span class="s0">it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications,</span>
<a name="l10654"><span class="ln">10654 </span></a><span class="s0">I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.</span>
<a name="l10655"><span class="ln">10655 </span></a><span class="s0">A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.&quot;</span>

<a name="l10658"><span class="ln">10658 </span></a><span class="s0">shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will</span>
<a name="l10659"><span class="ln">10659 </span></a><span class="s0">be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right</span>
<a name="l10660"><span class="ln">10660 </span></a><span class="s0">to move in the first circle.  Your musical knowledge alone would</span>
<a name="l10661"><span class="ln">10661 </span></a><span class="s0">entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like,</span>
<a name="l10662"><span class="ln">10662 </span></a><span class="s0">and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--</span>
<a name="l10663"><span class="ln">10663 </span></a><span class="s0">if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure;</span>
<a name="l10664"><span class="ln">10664 </span></a><span class="s0">but you sing as well as play;--yes, I really believe you might,</span>
<a name="l10665"><span class="ln">10665 </span></a><span class="s0">even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and you must</span>
<a name="l10666"><span class="ln">10666 </span></a><span class="s0">and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before</span>
<a name="l10667"><span class="ln">10667 </span></a><span class="s0">the Campbells or I have any rest.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10668"><span class="ln">10668 </span></a>

<a name="l10670"><span class="ln">10670 </span></a><span class="s0">of such a situation together,&quot; said Jane, &quot;they are pretty sure</span>
<a name="l10671"><span class="ln">10671 </span></a><span class="s0">to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing</span>
<a name="l10672"><span class="ln">10672 </span></a><span class="s0">to be attempted at present for me.  I am exceedingly obliged to you,</span>
<a name="l10673"><span class="ln">10673 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am</span>
<a name="l10674"><span class="ln">10674 </span></a><span class="s0">quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer.</span>
<a name="l10675"><span class="ln">10675 </span></a><span class="s0">For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as</span>
<a name="l10676"><span class="ln">10676 </span></a><span class="s0">I am.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10677"><span class="ln">10677 </span></a>
<a name="l10678"><span class="ln">10678 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And I am quite serious too, I assure you,&quot; replied Mrs. Elton gaily,</span>
<a name="l10679"><span class="ln">10679 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends</span>
<a name="l10680"><span class="ln">10680 </span></a><span class="s0">to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10681"><span class="ln">10681 </span></a>
<a name="l10682"><span class="ln">10682 </span></a><span class="s0">In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing</span>
<a name="l10683"><span class="ln">10683 </span></a><span class="s0">till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change</span>
<a name="l10684"><span class="ln">10684 </span></a><span class="s0">of object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,</span>
<a name="l10685"><span class="ln">10685 </span></a>
<a name="l10686"><span class="ln">10686 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his</span>
<a name="l10687"><span class="ln">10687 </span></a><span class="s0">gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature</span>
<a name="l10688"><span class="ln">10688 </span></a><span class="s0">he is;--I assure you I like him excessively.  I admire all that quaint,</span>
<a name="l10689"><span class="ln">10689 </span></a><span class="s0">old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;</span>
<a name="l10690"><span class="ln">10690 </span></a><span class="s0">modern ease often disgusts me.  But this good old Mr. Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l10691"><span class="ln">10691 </span></a><span class="s0">I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.  Oh!  I assure</span>
<a name="l10692"><span class="ln">10692 </span></a><span class="s0">you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous.</span>
<a name="l10693"><span class="ln">10693 </span></a><span class="s0">I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown.</span>
<a name="l10694"><span class="ln">10694 </span></a><span class="s0">How do you like it?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I</span>
<a name="l10695"><span class="ln">10695 </span></a><span class="s0">do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest</span>
<a name="l10696"><span class="ln">10696 </span></a><span class="s0">dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery.</span>
<a name="l10697"><span class="ln">10697 </span></a><span class="s0">I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me.</span>
<a name="l10698"><span class="ln">10698 </span></a><span class="s0">A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste</span>
<a name="l10699"><span class="ln">10699 </span></a><span class="s0">is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely</span>
<a name="l10700"><span class="ln">10700 </span></a><span class="s0">preferable to finery.  But I am quite in the minority, I believe;</span>
<a name="l10701"><span class="ln">10701 </span></a><span class="s0">few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery</span>
<a name="l10702"><span class="ln">10702 </span></a><span class="s0">are every thing.  I have some notion of putting such a trimming</span>
<a name="l10703"><span class="ln">10703 </span></a><span class="s0">as this to my white and silver poplin.  Do you think it will</span>
<a name="l10704"><span class="ln">10704 </span></a><span class="s0">look well?&quot;</span>
<a name="l10705"><span class="ln">10705 </span></a>
<a name="l10706"><span class="ln">10706 </span></a><span class="s0">The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room</span>
<a name="l10707"><span class="ln">10707 </span></a><span class="s0">when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them.  He had returned</span>
<a name="l10708"><span class="ln">10708 </span></a><span class="s0">to a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over.</span>
<a name="l10709"><span class="ln">10709 </span></a><span class="s0">He had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize--</span>
<a name="l10710"><span class="ln">10710 </span></a><span class="s0">but there was great joy.  Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see</span>
<a name="l10711"><span class="ln">10711 </span></a><span class="s0">him now, as he would have been sorry to see him before.  John Knightley</span>
<a name="l10712"><span class="ln">10712 </span></a><span class="s0">only was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent</span>
<a name="l10713"><span class="ln">10713 </span></a><span class="s0">his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London,</span>
<a name="l10714"><span class="ln">10714 </span></a><span class="s0">should set off again, and walk half a mile to another man's house,</span>
<a name="l10715"><span class="ln">10715 </span></a><span class="s0">for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing</span>
<a name="l10716"><span class="ln">10716 </span></a><span class="s0">his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers,</span>
<a name="l10717"><span class="ln">10717 </span></a><span class="s0">was a circumstance to strike him deeply.  A man who had been in motion</span>
<a name="l10718"><span class="ln">10718 </span></a><span class="s0">since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been still,</span>
<a name="l10719"><span class="ln">10719 </span></a><span class="s0">who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been</span>
<a name="l10720"><span class="ln">10720 </span></a><span class="s0">in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man,</span>
<a name="l10721"><span class="ln">10721 </span></a><span class="s0">to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside,</span>
<a name="l10722"><span class="ln">10722 </span></a><span class="s0">and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into</span>
<a name="l10723"><span class="ln">10723 </span></a><span class="s0">the world!--Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken</span>
<a name="l10724"><span class="ln">10724 </span></a><span class="s0">back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would</span>
<a name="l10725"><span class="ln">10725 </span></a><span class="s0">probably prolong rather than break up the party.  John Knightley</span>
<a name="l10726"><span class="ln">10726 </span></a><span class="s0">looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said,</span>
<a name="l10727"><span class="ln">10727 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I could not have believed it even of _him_.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10728"><span class="ln">10728 </span></a>
<a name="l10729"><span class="ln">10729 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation</span>
<a name="l10730"><span class="ln">10730 </span></a><span class="s0">he was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all</span>
<a name="l10731"><span class="ln">10731 </span></a><span class="s0">the right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere</span>
<a name="l10732"><span class="ln">10732 </span></a><span class="s0">from home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest;</span>
<a name="l10733"><span class="ln">10733 </span></a><span class="s0">and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner,</span>
<a name="l10734"><span class="ln">10734 </span></a><span class="s0">convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants</span>
<a name="l10735"><span class="ln">10735 </span></a><span class="s0">had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had heard,</span>
<a name="l10736"><span class="ln">10736 </span></a><span class="s0">was proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally</span>
<a name="l10737"><span class="ln">10737 </span></a><span class="s0">addressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being</span>
<a name="l10738"><span class="ln">10738 </span></a><span class="s0">highly interesting to every body in the room.  He gave her a letter,</span>
<a name="l10739"><span class="ln">10739 </span></a><span class="s0">it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way,</span>
<a name="l10740"><span class="ln">10740 </span></a><span class="s0">and had taken the liberty of opening it.</span>
<a name="l10741"><span class="ln">10741 </span></a>
<a name="l10742"><span class="ln">10742 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Read it, read it,&quot; said he, &quot;it will give you pleasure;</span>
<a name="l10743"><span class="ln">10743 </span></a><span class="s0">only a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10744"><span class="ln">10744 </span></a>
<a name="l10745"><span class="ln">10745 </span></a><span class="s0">The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling</span>
<a name="l10746"><span class="ln">10746 </span></a><span class="s0">and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued,</span>
<a name="l10747"><span class="ln">10747 </span></a><span class="s0">but very audible to every body.</span>
<a name="l10748"><span class="ln">10748 </span></a>
<a name="l10749"><span class="ln">10749 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think.  Well, what do</span>
<a name="l10750"><span class="ln">10750 </span></a><span class="s0">you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon,</span>
<a name="l10751"><span class="ln">10751 </span></a><span class="s0">did not I?--Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would</span>
<a name="l10752"><span class="ln">10752 </span></a><span class="s0">not believe me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say;</span>
<a name="l10753"><span class="ln">10753 </span></a><span class="s0">for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is</span>
<a name="l10754"><span class="ln">10754 </span></a><span class="s0">to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday.</span>
<a name="l10755"><span class="ln">10755 </span></a><span class="s0">As to her illness, all nothing of course.  But it is an excellent</span>
<a name="l10756"><span class="ln">10756 </span></a><span class="s0">thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town.  They will stay</span>
<a name="l10757"><span class="ln">10757 </span></a><span class="s0">a good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us.</span>
<a name="l10758"><span class="ln">10758 </span></a><span class="s0">This is precisely what I wanted.  Well, pretty good news, is not it?</span>
<a name="l10759"><span class="ln">10759 </span></a><span class="s0">Have you finished it?  Has Emma read it all?  Put it up, put it up;</span>
<a name="l10760"><span class="ln">10760 </span></a><span class="s0">we will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not</span>
<a name="l10761"><span class="ln">10761 </span></a><span class="s0">do now.  I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a</span>
<a name="l10762"><span class="ln">10762 </span></a><span class="s0">common way.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10763"><span class="ln">10763 </span></a>
<a name="l10764"><span class="ln">10764 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion.</span>
<a name="l10765"><span class="ln">10765 </span></a><span class="s0">Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them.  She was happy,</span>
<a name="l10766"><span class="ln">10766 </span></a><span class="s0">she knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy.</span>
<a name="l10767"><span class="ln">10767 </span></a><span class="s0">Her congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak</span>
<a name="l10768"><span class="ln">10768 </span></a><span class="s0">so fluently.  _She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings,</span>
<a name="l10769"><span class="ln">10769 </span></a><span class="s0">and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she</span>
<a name="l10770"><span class="ln">10770 </span></a><span class="s0">rather thought was considerable.</span>
<a name="l10771"><span class="ln">10771 </span></a>
<a name="l10772"><span class="ln">10772 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative</span>
<a name="l10773"><span class="ln">10773 </span></a><span class="s0">to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,</span>
<a name="l10774"><span class="ln">10774 </span></a><span class="s0">and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial</span>
<a name="l10775"><span class="ln">10775 </span></a><span class="s0">communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.</span>
<a name="l10776"><span class="ln">10776 </span></a>
<a name="l10777"><span class="ln">10777 </span></a><span class="s0">It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he</span>
<a name="l10778"><span class="ln">10778 </span></a><span class="s0">might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l10779"><span class="ln">10779 </span></a><span class="s0">particularly delighted.  They were the first entitled,</span>
<a name="l10780"><span class="ln">10780 </span></a><span class="s0">after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;--from them he would</span>
<a name="l10781"><span class="ln">10781 </span></a><span class="s0">have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation</span>
<a name="l10782"><span class="ln">10782 </span></a><span class="s0">with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive</span>
<a name="l10783"><span class="ln">10783 </span></a><span class="s0">an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and</span>
<a name="l10784"><span class="ln">10784 </span></a><span class="s0">her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.</span>

<a name="l10792"><span class="ln">10792 </span></a><span class="s0">said Mr. Weston.</span>

<a name="l10794"><span class="ln">10794 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended</span>
<a name="l10795"><span class="ln">10795 </span></a><span class="s0">her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.</span>
<a name="l10796"><span class="ln">10796 </span></a>
<a name="l10797"><span class="ln">10797 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,&quot; he continued--</span>

<a name="l10800"><span class="ln">10800 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance.</span>
<a name="l10801"><span class="ln">10801 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we</span>
<a name="l10802"><span class="ln">10802 </span></a><span class="s0">shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10803"><span class="ln">10803 </span></a>
<a name="l10804"><span class="ln">10804 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--</span>
<a name="l10805"><span class="ln">10805 </span></a><span class="s0">He is to be in town next week, if not sooner.  We have notice of it</span>
<a name="l10806"><span class="ln">10806 </span></a><span class="s0">in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning,</span>
<a name="l10807"><span class="ln">10807 </span></a><span class="s0">and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed</span>
<a name="l10808"><span class="ln">10808 </span></a><span class="s0">to me--it was to Mrs. Weston.  She is his principal correspondent,</span>
<a name="l10809"><span class="ln">10809 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you.  I hardly ever get a letter.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10810"><span class="ln">10810 </span></a>
<a name="l10811"><span class="ln">10811 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!  Oh!  Mr. Weston--</span>
<a name="l10812"><span class="ln">10812 </span></a><span class="s0">(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous</span>
<a name="l10813"><span class="ln">10813 </span></a><span class="s0">precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow</span>
<a name="l10814"><span class="ln">10814 </span></a><span class="s0">your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect,</span>
<a name="l10815"><span class="ln">10815 </span></a><span class="s0">we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh!  Mr. Weston,</span>

<a name="l10817"><span class="ln">10817 </span></a>
<a name="l10818"><span class="ln">10818 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Aye, we men are sad fellows.  You must take care of yourself,</span>

<a name="l10820"><span class="ln">10820 </span></a><span class="s0">a hurry, merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all</span>
<a name="l10821"><span class="ln">10821 </span></a><span class="s0">coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she has</span>
<a name="l10822"><span class="ln">10822 </span></a><span class="s0">not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--</span>
<a name="l10823"><span class="ln">10823 </span></a><span class="s0">so they are all to move southward without loss of time.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10824"><span class="ln">10824 </span></a>
<a name="l10825"><span class="ln">10825 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think.  Enscombe is in Yorkshire?&quot;</span>
<a name="l10826"><span class="ln">10826 </span></a>
<a name="l10827"><span class="ln">10827 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London.</span>
<a name="l10828"><span class="ln">10828 </span></a><span class="s0">a considerable journey.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10829"><span class="ln">10829 </span></a>
<a name="l10830"><span class="ln">10830 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, upon my word, very considerable.  Sixty-five miles farther</span>
<a name="l10831"><span class="ln">10831 </span></a><span class="s0">than from Maple Grove to London.  But what is distance, Mr. Weston,</span>
<a name="l10832"><span class="ln">10832 </span></a><span class="s0">to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother,</span>
<a name="l10833"><span class="ln">10833 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about.  You will hardly believe me--</span>
<a name="l10834"><span class="ln">10834 </span></a><span class="s0">but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again</span>
<a name="l10835"><span class="ln">10835 </span></a><span class="s0">with four horses.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10836"><span class="ln">10836 </span></a>
<a name="l10837"><span class="ln">10837 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The evil of the distance from Enscombe,&quot; said Mr. Weston, &quot;is, that</span>
<a name="l10838"><span class="ln">10838 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the</span>
<a name="l10839"><span class="ln">10839 </span></a><span class="s0">sofa for a week together.  In Frank's last letter she complained,</span>
<a name="l10840"><span class="ln">10840 </span></a><span class="s0">he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having</span>
<a name="l10841"><span class="ln">10841 </span></a><span class="s0">both his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree</span>
<a name="l10842"><span class="ln">10842 </span></a><span class="s0">of weakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she</span>
<a name="l10843"><span class="ln">10843 </span></a><span class="s0">means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word.</span>
<a name="l10844"><span class="ln">10844 </span></a><span class="s0">Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions,</span>
<a name="l10845"><span class="ln">10845 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton.  You must grant me that.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10846"><span class="ln">10846 </span></a>
<a name="l10847"><span class="ln">10847 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing.  I Always take the part</span>
<a name="l10848"><span class="ln">10848 </span></a><span class="s0">of my own sex.  I do indeed.  I give you notice--You will find me</span>
<a name="l10849"><span class="ln">10849 </span></a><span class="s0">a formidable antagonist on that point.  I always stand up for women--</span>
<a name="l10850"><span class="ln">10850 </span></a><span class="s0">and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect</span>
<a name="l10851"><span class="ln">10851 </span></a><span class="s0">to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's</span>
<a name="l10852"><span class="ln">10852 </span></a><span class="s0">making incredible exertions to avoid it.  Selina says it is quite</span>
<a name="l10853"><span class="ln">10853 </span></a><span class="s0">horror to her--and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety.</span>
<a name="l10854"><span class="ln">10854 </span></a><span class="s0">She always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution.</span>
<a name="l10855"><span class="ln">10855 </span></a><span class="s0">Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?&quot;</span>
<a name="l10856"><span class="ln">10856 </span></a>
<a name="l10857"><span class="ln">10857 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other</span>
<a name="l10858"><span class="ln">10858 </span></a><span class="s0">fine lady ever did.  Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady</span>
<a name="l10859"><span class="ln">10859 </span></a><span class="s0">in the land for&quot;--</span>
<a name="l10860"><span class="ln">10860 </span></a>
<a name="l10861"><span class="ln">10861 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,</span>
<a name="l10862"><span class="ln">10862 </span></a>
<a name="l10863"><span class="ln">10863 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!  Mr. Weston, do not mistake me.  Selina is no fine lady,</span>
<a name="l10864"><span class="ln">10864 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you.  Do not run away with such an idea.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10865"><span class="ln">10865 </span></a>
<a name="l10866"><span class="ln">10866 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Is not she?  Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is</span>
<a name="l10867"><span class="ln">10867 </span></a><span class="s0">as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10868"><span class="ln">10868 </span></a>
<a name="l10869"><span class="ln">10869 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.</span>
<a name="l10870"><span class="ln">10870 </span></a><span class="s0">It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister</span>
<a name="l10871"><span class="ln">10871 </span></a><span class="s0">was _not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence</span>
<a name="l10872"><span class="ln">10872 </span></a><span class="s0">of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract,</span>
<a name="l10873"><span class="ln">10873 </span></a><span class="s0">when Mr. Weston went on.</span>
<a name="l10874"><span class="ln">10874 </span></a>
<a name="l10875"><span class="ln">10875 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--</span>
<a name="l10876"><span class="ln">10876 </span></a><span class="s0">but this is quite between ourselves.  She is very fond of Frank,</span>
<a name="l10877"><span class="ln">10877 </span></a><span class="s0">and therefore I would not speak ill of her.  Besides, she is out of</span>
<a name="l10878"><span class="ln">10878 </span></a><span class="s0">health now; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been.</span>
<a name="l10879"><span class="ln">10879 </span></a><span class="s0">I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much</span>
<a name="l10880"><span class="ln">10880 </span></a><span class="s0">faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10881"><span class="ln">10881 </span></a>
<a name="l10882"><span class="ln">10882 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath,</span>
<a name="l10883"><span class="ln">10883 </span></a><span class="s0">or to Clifton?&quot;  &quot;She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too</span>
<a name="l10884"><span class="ln">10884 </span></a><span class="s0">cold for her.  The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe.</span>
<a name="l10885"><span class="ln">10885 </span></a><span class="s0">She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever</span>
<a name="l10886"><span class="ln">10886 </span></a><span class="s0">was before, and she begins to want change.  It is a retired place.</span>
<a name="l10887"><span class="ln">10887 </span></a><span class="s0">A fine place, but very retired.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10888"><span class="ln">10888 </span></a>
<a name="l10889"><span class="ln">10889 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say.  Nothing can stand more retired from</span>
<a name="l10890"><span class="ln">10890 </span></a><span class="s0">the road than Maple Grove.  Such an immense plantation all round it!</span>
<a name="l10891"><span class="ln">10891 </span></a><span class="s0">You seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--</span>
<a name="l10892"><span class="ln">10892 </span></a><span class="s0">And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina</span>
<a name="l10893"><span class="ln">10893 </span></a><span class="s0">to enjoy that sort of seclusion.  Or, perhaps she may not have</span>
<a name="l10894"><span class="ln">10894 </span></a><span class="s0">resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life.</span>
<a name="l10895"><span class="ln">10895 </span></a><span class="s0">I always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel</span>
<a name="l10896"><span class="ln">10896 </span></a><span class="s0">very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent</span>
<a name="l10897"><span class="ln">10897 </span></a><span class="s0">of society.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10898"><span class="ln">10898 </span></a>
<a name="l10899"><span class="ln">10899 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Frank was here in February for a fortnight.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10900"><span class="ln">10900 </span></a>
<a name="l10901"><span class="ln">10901 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So I remember to have heard.  He will find an _addition_ to the</span>
<a name="l10902"><span class="ln">10902 </span></a><span class="s0">society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume</span>
<a name="l10903"><span class="ln">10903 </span></a><span class="s0">to call myself an addition.  But perhaps he may never have heard</span>
<a name="l10904"><span class="ln">10904 </span></a><span class="s0">of there being such a creature in the world.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10905"><span class="ln">10905 </span></a>
<a name="l10906"><span class="ln">10906 </span></a><span class="s0">This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by,</span>
<a name="l10907"><span class="ln">10907 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,</span>
<a name="l10908"><span class="ln">10908 </span></a>
<a name="l10909"><span class="ln">10909 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear madam!  Nobody but yourself could imagine such a</span>
<a name="l10910"><span class="ln">10910 </span></a><span class="s0">thing possible.  Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's</span>
<a name="l10911"><span class="ln">10911 </span></a><span class="s0">letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10912"><span class="ln">10912 </span></a>
<a name="l10913"><span class="ln">10913 </span></a><span class="s0">He had done his duty and could return to his son.</span>
<a name="l10914"><span class="ln">10914 </span></a>
<a name="l10915"><span class="ln">10915 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;When Frank left us,&quot; continued he, &quot;it was quite uncertain when we</span>
<a name="l10916"><span class="ln">10916 </span></a><span class="s0">might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome.</span>
<a name="l10917"><span class="ln">10917 </span></a><span class="s0">It has been completely unexpected.  That is, _I_ always had a strong</span>
<a name="l10918"><span class="ln">10918 </span></a><span class="s0">persuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something</span>
<a name="l10919"><span class="ln">10919 </span></a><span class="s0">favourable would turn up--but nobody believed me.  He and Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l10920"><span class="ln">10920 </span></a><span class="s0">were both dreadfully desponding.  `How could he contrive to come?</span>
<a name="l10921"><span class="ln">10921 </span></a><span class="s0">And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare</span>
<a name="l10922"><span class="ln">10922 </span></a><span class="s0">him again?' and so forth--I always felt that something would happen</span>
<a name="l10923"><span class="ln">10923 </span></a><span class="s0">in our favour; and so it has, you see.  I have observed, Mrs. Elton,</span>
<a name="l10924"><span class="ln">10924 </span></a><span class="s0">in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month,</span>
<a name="l10925"><span class="ln">10925 </span></a><span class="s0">they are sure to mend the next.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10926"><span class="ln">10926 </span></a>
<a name="l10927"><span class="ln">10927 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true.  It is just what I used</span>
<a name="l10928"><span class="ln">10928 </span></a><span class="s0">to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship,</span>
<a name="l10929"><span class="ln">10929 </span></a><span class="s0">when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all</span>
<a name="l10930"><span class="ln">10930 </span></a><span class="s0">the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair,</span>
<a name="l10931"><span class="ln">10931 </span></a><span class="s0">and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before</span>
<a name="l10932"><span class="ln">10932 </span></a><span class="s0">Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us.  Oh! the pains I have</span>
<a name="l10933"><span class="ln">10933 </span></a><span class="s0">been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views!</span>
<a name="l10934"><span class="ln">10934 </span></a><span class="s0">The carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning,</span>
<a name="l10935"><span class="ln">10935 </span></a><span class="s0">I remember, he came to me quite in despair.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10936"><span class="ln">10936 </span></a>
<a name="l10937"><span class="ln">10937 </span></a><span class="s0">She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly</span>
<a name="l10938"><span class="ln">10938 </span></a><span class="s0">seized the opportunity of going on.</span>
<a name="l10939"><span class="ln">10939 </span></a>
<a name="l10940"><span class="ln">10940 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You were mentioning May.  May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill</span>
<a name="l10941"><span class="ln">10941 </span></a><span class="s0">is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place</span>
<a name="l10942"><span class="ln">10942 </span></a><span class="s0">than Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the</span>
<a name="l10943"><span class="ln">10943 </span></a><span class="s0">agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--</span>
<a name="l10944"><span class="ln">10944 </span></a><span class="s0">precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen</span>
<a name="l10945"><span class="ln">10945 </span></a><span class="s0">for it:  days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant,</span>
<a name="l10946"><span class="ln">10946 </span></a><span class="s0">always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.  When he</span>
<a name="l10947"><span class="ln">10947 </span></a><span class="s0">was here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal</span>
<a name="l10948"><span class="ln">10948 </span></a><span class="s0">of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know,</span>
<a name="l10949"><span class="ln">10949 </span></a><span class="s0">and we could not do half that we intended.  Now will be the time.</span>
<a name="l10950"><span class="ln">10950 </span></a><span class="s0">This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton,</span>
<a name="l10951"><span class="ln">10951 </span></a><span class="s0">whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant</span>
<a name="l10952"><span class="ln">10952 </span></a><span class="s0">expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow,</span>
<a name="l10953"><span class="ln">10953 </span></a><span class="s0">and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having</span>
<a name="l10954"><span class="ln">10954 </span></a><span class="s0">him actually in the house.  I think it is so.  I think it is the</span>
<a name="l10955"><span class="ln">10955 </span></a><span class="s0">state of mind which gives most spirit and delight.  I hope you</span>
<a name="l10956"><span class="ln">10956 </span></a><span class="s0">will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy.</span>
<a name="l10957"><span class="ln">10957 </span></a><span class="s0">He is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy.</span>
<a name="l10958"><span class="ln">10958 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston's partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose,</span>
<a name="l10959"><span class="ln">10959 </span></a><span class="s0">most gratifying to me.  She thinks nobody equal to him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10960"><span class="ln">10960 </span></a>
<a name="l10961"><span class="ln">10961 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my</span>
<a name="l10962"><span class="ln">10962 </span></a><span class="s0">opinion will be decidedly in his favour.  I have heard so much</span>
<a name="l10963"><span class="ln">10963 </span></a><span class="s0">in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair</span>
<a name="l10964"><span class="ln">10964 </span></a><span class="s0">to observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves,</span>
<a name="l10965"><span class="ln">10965 </span></a><span class="s0">and are by no means implicitly guided by others.  I give you notice</span>
<a name="l10966"><span class="ln">10966 </span></a><span class="s0">that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer.&quot;</span>
<a name="l10967"><span class="ln">10967 </span></a>
<a name="l10968"><span class="ln">10968 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston was musing.</span>
<a name="l10969"><span class="ln">10969 </span></a>
<a name="l10970"><span class="ln">10970 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope,&quot; said he presently, &quot;I have not been severe upon poor</span>
<a name="l10971"><span class="ln">10971 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Churchill.  If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice;</span>
<a name="l10972"><span class="ln">10972 </span></a><span class="s0">but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult</span>
<a name="l10973"><span class="ln">10973 </span></a><span class="s0">for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish.</span>
<a name="l10974"><span class="ln">10974 </span></a><span class="s0">You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family,</span>
<a name="l10975"><span class="ln">10975 </span></a><span class="s0">nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves,</span>
<a name="l10976"><span class="ln">10976 </span></a><span class="s0">the whole blame of it is to be laid to her.  She was the instigator.</span>
<a name="l10977"><span class="ln">10977 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her.</span>
<a name="l10978"><span class="ln">10978 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife's:</span>
<a name="l10979"><span class="ln">10979 </span></a><span class="s0">his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would</span>
<a name="l10980"><span class="ln">10980 </span></a><span class="s0">harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome;</span>
<a name="l10981"><span class="ln">10981 </span></a><span class="s0">but her pride is arrogance and insolence!  And what inclines one less</span>
<a name="l10982"><span class="ln">10982 </span></a><span class="s0">to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.  She was nobody</span>
<a name="l10983"><span class="ln">10983 </span></a><span class="s0">when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever</span>
<a name="l10984"><span class="ln">10984 </span></a><span class="s0">since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them</span>
<a name="l10985"><span class="ln">10985 </span></a><span class="s0">all in high and mighty claims:  but in herself, I assure you, she is</span>

<a name="l10987"><span class="ln">10987 </span></a>
<a name="l10988"><span class="ln">10988 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking!  I have quite</span>
<a name="l10989"><span class="ln">10989 </span></a><span class="s0">a horror of upstarts.  Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust</span>
<a name="l10990"><span class="ln">10990 </span></a><span class="s0">to people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood</span>
<a name="l10991"><span class="ln">10991 </span></a><span class="s0">who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs</span>
<a name="l10992"><span class="ln">10992 </span></a><span class="s0">they give themselves!  Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me</span>
<a name="l10993"><span class="ln">10993 </span></a><span class="s0">think of them directly.  People of the name of Tupman, very lately</span>
<a name="l10994"><span class="ln">10994 </span></a><span class="s0">settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving</span>
<a name="l10995"><span class="ln">10995 </span></a><span class="s0">themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old</span>
<a name="l10996"><span class="ln">10996 </span></a><span class="s0">established families.  A year and a half is the very utmost that they can</span>
<a name="l10997"><span class="ln">10997 </span></a><span class="s0">have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows.</span>
<a name="l10998"><span class="ln">10998 </span></a><span class="s0">They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much,</span>
<a name="l10999"><span class="ln">10999 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, Mr. Weston.  One has not great hopes from Birmingham.</span>
<a name="l11000"><span class="ln">11000 </span></a><span class="s0">I always say there is something direful in the sound:  but nothing</span>
<a name="l11001"><span class="ln">11001 </span></a><span class="s0">more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things</span>
<a name="l11002"><span class="ln">11002 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently</span>
<a name="l11003"><span class="ln">11003 </span></a><span class="s0">think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens</span>
<a name="l11004"><span class="ln">11004 </span></a><span class="s0">to be one of their nearest neighbours.  It is infinitely too bad.</span>
<a name="l11005"><span class="ln">11005 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove,</span>
<a name="l11006"><span class="ln">11006 </span></a><span class="s0">and whose father had it before him--I believe, at least--I am</span>
<a name="l11007"><span class="ln">11007 </span></a><span class="s0">almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before</span>
<a name="l11008"><span class="ln">11008 </span></a><span class="s0">his death.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11009"><span class="ln">11009 </span></a>
<a name="l11010"><span class="ln">11010 </span></a><span class="s0">They were interrupted.  Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston,</span>
<a name="l11011"><span class="ln">11011 </span></a><span class="s0">having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of</span>
<a name="l11012"><span class="ln">11012 </span></a><span class="s0">walking away.</span>
<a name="l11013"><span class="ln">11013 </span></a>
<a name="l11014"><span class="ln">11014 </span></a><span class="s0">After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l11015"><span class="ln">11015 </span></a><span class="s0">to cards.  The remaining five were left to their own powers,</span>
<a name="l11016"><span class="ln">11016 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed</span>
<a name="l11017"><span class="ln">11017 </span></a><span class="s0">little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice,</span>
<a name="l11018"><span class="ln">11018 </span></a><span class="s0">which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself</span>
<a name="l11019"><span class="ln">11019 </span></a><span class="s0">in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.</span>
<a name="l11020"><span class="ln">11020 </span></a>
<a name="l11021"><span class="ln">11021 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother.</span>
<a name="l11022"><span class="ln">11022 </span></a><span class="s0">He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--</span>
<a name="l11023"><span class="ln">11023 </span></a>
<a name="l11024"><span class="ln">11024 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about</span>
<a name="l11025"><span class="ln">11025 </span></a><span class="s0">the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is</span>
<a name="l11026"><span class="ln">11026 </span></a><span class="s0">down at full length there we may be sure.  My charge would be much</span>
<a name="l11027"><span class="ln">11027 </span></a><span class="s0">more concise than her's, and probably not much in the same spirit;</span>
<a name="l11028"><span class="ln">11028 </span></a><span class="s0">all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them,</span>
<a name="l11029"><span class="ln">11029 </span></a><span class="s0">and do not physic them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11030"><span class="ln">11030 </span></a>
<a name="l11031"><span class="ln">11031 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I rather hope to satisfy you both,&quot; said Emma, &quot;for I shall do all</span>
<a name="l11032"><span class="ln">11032 </span></a><span class="s0">in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella;</span>
<a name="l11033"><span class="ln">11033 </span></a><span class="s0">and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11034"><span class="ln">11034 </span></a>
<a name="l11035"><span class="ln">11035 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11036"><span class="ln">11036 </span></a>
<a name="l11037"><span class="ln">11037 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That is very likely.  You think so, do not you?&quot;</span>
<a name="l11038"><span class="ln">11038 </span></a>
<a name="l11039"><span class="ln">11039 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--</span>
<a name="l11040"><span class="ln">11040 </span></a><span class="s0">or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements</span>
<a name="l11041"><span class="ln">11041 </span></a><span class="s0">continue to increase as much as they have done lately.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11042"><span class="ln">11042 </span></a>
<a name="l11043"><span class="ln">11043 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Increase!&quot;</span>
<a name="l11044"><span class="ln">11044 </span></a>
<a name="l11045"><span class="ln">11045 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made</span>
<a name="l11046"><span class="ln">11046 </span></a><span class="s0">a great difference in your way of life.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11047"><span class="ln">11047 </span></a>
<a name="l11048"><span class="ln">11048 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Difference!  No indeed I am not.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11049"><span class="ln">11049 </span></a>
<a name="l11050"><span class="ln">11050 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company</span>
<a name="l11051"><span class="ln">11051 </span></a><span class="s0">than you used to be.  Witness this very time.  Here am I come</span>
<a name="l11052"><span class="ln">11052 </span></a><span class="s0">down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--</span>
<a name="l11053"><span class="ln">11053 </span></a><span class="s0">When did it happen before, or any thing like it?  Your neighbourhood</span>
<a name="l11054"><span class="ln">11054 </span></a><span class="s0">is increasing, and you mix more with it.  A little while ago,</span>
<a name="l11055"><span class="ln">11055 </span></a><span class="s0">every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties;</span>
<a name="l11056"><span class="ln">11056 </span></a><span class="s0">dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown.  The difference</span>
<a name="l11057"><span class="ln">11057 </span></a><span class="s0">which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11058"><span class="ln">11058 </span></a>
<a name="l11059"><span class="ln">11059 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; said his brother quickly, &quot;it is Randalls that does it all.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11060"><span class="ln">11060 </span></a>
<a name="l11061"><span class="ln">11061 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less</span>
<a name="l11062"><span class="ln">11062 </span></a><span class="s0">influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,</span>
<a name="l11063"><span class="ln">11063 </span></a><span class="s0">that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way.  And if they are,</span>
<a name="l11064"><span class="ln">11064 </span></a><span class="s0">I only beg you to send them home.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11065"><span class="ln">11065 </span></a>
<a name="l11066"><span class="ln">11066 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot; cried Mr. Knightley, &quot;that need not be the consequence.</span>
<a name="l11067"><span class="ln">11067 </span></a><span class="s0">Let them be sent to Donwell.  I shall certainly be at leisure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11068"><span class="ln">11068 </span></a>
<a name="l11069"><span class="ln">11069 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon my word,&quot; exclaimed Emma, &quot;you amuse me!  I should like to know</span>
<a name="l11070"><span class="ln">11070 </span></a><span class="s0">how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being</span>
<a name="l11071"><span class="ln">11071 </span></a><span class="s0">of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure</span>
<a name="l11072"><span class="ln">11072 </span></a><span class="s0">to attend to the little boys.  These amazing engagements of mine--</span>
<a name="l11073"><span class="ln">11073 </span></a><span class="s0">what have they been?  Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball</span>
<a name="l11074"><span class="ln">11074 </span></a><span class="s0">talked of, which never took place.  I can understand you--(nodding at</span>
<a name="l11075"><span class="ln">11075 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of</span>
<a name="l11076"><span class="ln">11076 </span></a><span class="s0">your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed.</span>
<a name="l11077"><span class="ln">11077 </span></a><span class="s0">But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom</span>
<a name="l11078"><span class="ln">11078 </span></a><span class="s0">I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a</span>
<a name="l11079"><span class="ln">11079 </span></a><span class="s0">series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.  And as to my dear</span>
<a name="l11080"><span class="ln">11080 </span></a><span class="s0">little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them,</span>
<a name="l11081"><span class="ln">11081 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley,</span>
<a name="l11082"><span class="ln">11082 </span></a><span class="s0">who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one--</span>
<a name="l11083"><span class="ln">11083 </span></a><span class="s0">and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself or settling</span>
<a name="l11084"><span class="ln">11084 </span></a><span class="s0">his accounts.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11085"><span class="ln">11085 </span></a>
<a name="l11086"><span class="ln">11086 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded</span>
<a name="l11087"><span class="ln">11087 </span></a><span class="s0">without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.</span>

<a name="l11097"><span class="ln">11097 </span></a>
<a name="l11098"><span class="ln">11098 </span></a>
<a name="l11099"><span class="ln">11099 </span></a><span class="s0">A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the</span>
<a name="l11100"><span class="ln">11100 </span></a><span class="s0">nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill.</span>
<a name="l11101"><span class="ln">11101 </span></a><span class="s0">She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at</span>
<a name="l11102"><span class="ln">11102 </span></a><span class="s0">all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him.  Her own attachment</span>
<a name="l11103"><span class="ln">11103 </span></a><span class="s0">had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--</span>
<a name="l11104"><span class="ln">11104 </span></a><span class="s0">but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love</span>
<a name="l11105"><span class="ln">11105 </span></a><span class="s0">of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment</span>
<a name="l11106"><span class="ln">11106 </span></a><span class="s0">which he had taken away, it would be very distressing.  If a separation</span>
<a name="l11107"><span class="ln">11107 </span></a><span class="s0">of two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils</span>
<a name="l11108"><span class="ln">11108 </span></a><span class="s0">before her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary.</span>
<a name="l11109"><span class="ln">11109 </span></a><span class="s0">She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again,</span>
<a name="l11110"><span class="ln">11110 </span></a><span class="s0">and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.</span>
<a name="l11111"><span class="ln">11111 </span></a>
<a name="l11112"><span class="ln">11112 </span></a><span class="s0">She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.</span>
<a name="l11113"><span class="ln">11113 </span></a><span class="s0">That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance!</span>
<a name="l11114"><span class="ln">11114 </span></a><span class="s0">and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive.</span>
<a name="l11115"><span class="ln">11115 </span></a><span class="s0">She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis,</span>
<a name="l11116"><span class="ln">11116 </span></a><span class="s0">an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state.</span>
<a name="l11117"><span class="ln">11117 </span></a>
<a name="l11118"><span class="ln">11118 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,</span>
<a name="l11119"><span class="ln">11119 </span></a><span class="s0">before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's</span>
<a name="l11120"><span class="ln">11120 </span></a><span class="s0">feelings.  The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had</span>
<a name="l11121"><span class="ln">11121 </span></a><span class="s0">been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.  He rode</span>
<a name="l11122"><span class="ln">11122 </span></a><span class="s0">down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came</span>
<a name="l11123"><span class="ln">11123 </span></a><span class="s0">from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all</span>
<a name="l11124"><span class="ln">11124 </span></a><span class="s0">her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced,</span>
<a name="l11125"><span class="ln">11125 </span></a><span class="s0">and how she must act.  They met with the utmost friendliness.</span>
<a name="l11126"><span class="ln">11126 </span></a><span class="s0">There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her.</span>
<a name="l11127"><span class="ln">11127 </span></a><span class="s0">But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he</span>
<a name="l11128"><span class="ln">11128 </span></a><span class="s0">had done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree.</span>
<a name="l11129"><span class="ln">11129 </span></a><span class="s0">She watched him well.  It was a clear thing he was less in love than he</span>
<a name="l11130"><span class="ln">11130 </span></a><span class="s0">had been.  Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference,</span>
<a name="l11131"><span class="ln">11131 </span></a><span class="s0">had produced this very natural and very desirable effect.</span>
<a name="l11132"><span class="ln">11132 </span></a>
<a name="l11133"><span class="ln">11133 </span></a><span class="s0">He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed</span>
<a name="l11134"><span class="ln">11134 </span></a><span class="s0">delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories:</span>
<a name="l11135"><span class="ln">11135 </span></a><span class="s0">and he was not without agitation.  It was not in his calmness that</span>
<a name="l11136"><span class="ln">11136 </span></a><span class="s0">she read his comparative difference.  He was not calm; his spirits</span>
<a name="l11137"><span class="ln">11137 </span></a><span class="s0">were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him.</span>
<a name="l11138"><span class="ln">11138 </span></a><span class="s0">Lively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself;</span>
<a name="l11139"><span class="ln">11139 </span></a><span class="s0">but what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a</span>
<a name="l11140"><span class="ln">11140 </span></a><span class="s0">quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.</span>
<a name="l11141"><span class="ln">11141 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed--</span>
<a name="l11142"><span class="ln">11142 </span></a><span class="s0">he had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a word--but he</span>
<a name="l11143"><span class="ln">11143 </span></a><span class="s0">had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call,</span>
<a name="l11144"><span class="ln">11144 </span></a><span class="s0">and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11145"><span class="ln">11145 </span></a><span class="s0">She had no doubt as to his being less in love--but neither his</span>
<a name="l11146"><span class="ln">11146 </span></a><span class="s0">agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure;</span>
<a name="l11147"><span class="ln">11147 </span></a><span class="s0">and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her</span>
<a name="l11148"><span class="ln">11148 </span></a><span class="s0">returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself</span>
<a name="l11149"><span class="ln">11149 </span></a><span class="s0">with her long.</span>
<a name="l11150"><span class="ln">11150 </span></a>
<a name="l11151"><span class="ln">11151 </span></a><span class="s0">This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.</span>
<a name="l11152"><span class="ln">11152 </span></a><span class="s0">He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented.</span>
<a name="l11153"><span class="ln">11153 </span></a><span class="s0">His aunt could not bear to have him leave her.  Such was his own account</span>
<a name="l11154"><span class="ln">11154 </span></a><span class="s0">at Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come,</span>
<a name="l11155"><span class="ln">11155 </span></a><span class="s0">it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had</span>
<a name="l11156"><span class="ln">11156 </span></a><span class="s0">been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder.</span>
<a name="l11157"><span class="ln">11157 </span></a><span class="s0">That she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself</span>
<a name="l11158"><span class="ln">11158 </span></a><span class="s0">convinced of it, at Randalls.  Though much might be fancy, he could</span>
<a name="l11159"><span class="ln">11159 </span></a><span class="s0">not doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state</span>
<a name="l11160"><span class="ln">11160 </span></a><span class="s0">of health than she had been half a year ago.  He did not believe it</span>
<a name="l11161"><span class="ln">11161 </span></a><span class="s0">to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove,</span>
<a name="l11162"><span class="ln">11162 </span></a><span class="s0">or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her;</span>
<a name="l11163"><span class="ln">11163 </span></a><span class="s0">but he could not be prevailed on, by all his father's doubts, to say</span>
<a name="l11164"><span class="ln">11164 </span></a><span class="s0">that her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong</span>
<a name="l11165"><span class="ln">11165 </span></a><span class="s0">as ever.</span>
<a name="l11166"><span class="ln">11166 </span></a>
<a name="l11167"><span class="ln">11167 </span></a><span class="s0">It soon appeared that London was not the place for her.  She could</span>
<a name="l11168"><span class="ln">11168 </span></a><span class="s0">not endure its noise.  Her nerves were under continual irritation</span>
<a name="l11169"><span class="ln">11169 </span></a><span class="s0">and suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to</span>
<a name="l11170"><span class="ln">11170 </span></a><span class="s0">Randalls communicated a change of plan.  They were going to remove</span>
<a name="l11171"><span class="ln">11171 </span></a><span class="s0">immediately to Richmond.  Mrs. Churchill had been recommended</span>
<a name="l11172"><span class="ln">11172 </span></a><span class="s0">to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise</span>
<a name="l11173"><span class="ln">11173 </span></a><span class="s0">a fancy for the place.  A ready-furnished house in a favourite</span>
<a name="l11174"><span class="ln">11174 </span></a><span class="s0">spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.</span>
<a name="l11175"><span class="ln">11175 </span></a>
<a name="l11176"><span class="ln">11176 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,</span>
<a name="l11177"><span class="ln">11177 </span></a><span class="s0">and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two</span>
<a name="l11178"><span class="ln">11178 </span></a><span class="s0">months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--</span>
<a name="l11179"><span class="ln">11179 </span></a><span class="s0">for the house was taken for May and June.  She was told that now</span>
<a name="l11180"><span class="ln">11180 </span></a><span class="s0">he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them,</span>
<a name="l11181"><span class="ln">11181 </span></a><span class="s0">almost as often as he could even wish.</span>
<a name="l11182"><span class="ln">11182 </span></a>
<a name="l11183"><span class="ln">11183 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects.  He was</span>
<a name="l11184"><span class="ln">11184 </span></a><span class="s0">considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered.</span>
<a name="l11185"><span class="ln">11185 </span></a><span class="s0">She hoped it was not so.  Two months must bring it to the proof.</span>
<a name="l11186"><span class="ln">11186 </span></a>
<a name="l11187"><span class="ln">11187 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable.  He was quite delighted.</span>
<a name="l11188"><span class="ln">11188 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the very circumstance he could have wished for.  Now, it would</span>
<a name="l11189"><span class="ln">11189 </span></a><span class="s0">be really having Frank in their neighbourhood.  What were nine miles</span>
<a name="l11190"><span class="ln">11190 </span></a><span class="s0">to a young man?--An hour's ride.  He would be always coming over.</span>
<a name="l11191"><span class="ln">11191 </span></a><span class="s0">The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough</span>
<a name="l11192"><span class="ln">11192 </span></a><span class="s0">to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing</span>
<a name="l11193"><span class="ln">11193 </span></a><span class="s0">him never.  Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen</span>
<a name="l11194"><span class="ln">11194 </span></a><span class="s0">to Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle.  Were he ever able</span>
<a name="l11195"><span class="ln">11195 </span></a><span class="s0">to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning.</span>
<a name="l11196"><span class="ln">11196 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be</span>
<a name="l11197"><span class="ln">11197 </span></a><span class="s0">at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse.</span>
<a name="l11198"><span class="ln">11198 </span></a><span class="s0">Better than nearer!</span>
<a name="l11199"><span class="ln">11199 </span></a>
<a name="l11200"><span class="ln">11200 </span></a><span class="s0">One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,--</span>
<a name="l11201"><span class="ln">11201 </span></a><span class="s0">the ball at the Crown.  It had not been forgotten before, but it had</span>
<a name="l11202"><span class="ln">11202 </span></a><span class="s0">been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day.  Now, however,</span>
<a name="l11203"><span class="ln">11203 </span></a><span class="s0">it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon</span>
<a name="l11204"><span class="ln">11204 </span></a><span class="s0">after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank,</span>
<a name="l11205"><span class="ln">11205 </span></a><span class="s0">to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change,</span>
<a name="l11206"><span class="ln">11206 </span></a><span class="s0">and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four</span>
<a name="l11207"><span class="ln">11207 </span></a><span class="s0">hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.</span>
<a name="l11208"><span class="ln">11208 </span></a>
<a name="l11209"><span class="ln">11209 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing.  A very few to-morrows</span>
<a name="l11210"><span class="ln">11210 </span></a><span class="s0">stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.</span>
<a name="l11211"><span class="ln">11211 </span></a>
<a name="l11212"><span class="ln">11212 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse was resigned.  The time of year lightened the evil</span>
<a name="l11213"><span class="ln">11213 </span></a><span class="s0">to him.  May was better for every thing than February.  Mrs. Bates</span>
<a name="l11214"><span class="ln">11214 </span></a><span class="s0">was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice,</span>
<a name="l11215"><span class="ln">11215 </span></a><span class="s0">and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear</span>
<a name="l11216"><span class="ln">11216 </span></a><span class="s0">little John would have any thing the matter with them, while dear</span>
<a name="l11217"><span class="ln">11217 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma were gone.</span>
<a name="l11218"><span class="ln">11218 </span></a>
<a name="l11219"><span class="ln">11219 </span></a>
<a name="l11220"><span class="ln">11220 </span></a>
<a name="l11221"><span class="ln">11221 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER II</span>
<a name="l11222"><span class="ln">11222 </span></a>
<a name="l11223"><span class="ln">11223 </span></a>
<a name="l11224"><span class="ln">11224 </span></a><span class="s0">No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.  The day approached,</span>
<a name="l11225"><span class="ln">11225 </span></a><span class="s0">the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching,</span>
<a name="l11226"><span class="ln">11226 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls</span>
<a name="l11227"><span class="ln">11227 </span></a><span class="s0">before dinner, and every thing was safe.</span>
<a name="l11228"><span class="ln">11228 </span></a>
<a name="l11229"><span class="ln">11229 </span></a><span class="s0">No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma.</span>
<a name="l11230"><span class="ln">11230 </span></a><span class="s0">The room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better</span>
<a name="l11231"><span class="ln">11231 </span></a><span class="s0">than a common meeting in a crowd.  Mr. Weston had been so very</span>
<a name="l11232"><span class="ln">11232 </span></a><span class="s0">earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible</span>
<a name="l11233"><span class="ln">11233 </span></a><span class="s0">after themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the</span>
<a name="l11234"><span class="ln">11234 </span></a><span class="s0">propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came,</span>
<a name="l11235"><span class="ln">11235 </span></a><span class="s0">that she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet</span>
<a name="l11236"><span class="ln">11236 </span></a><span class="s0">interval in the young man's company.  She was to convey Harriet,</span>
<a name="l11237"><span class="ln">11237 </span></a><span class="s0">and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just</span>
<a name="l11238"><span class="ln">11238 </span></a><span class="s0">sufficiently before them.</span>
<a name="l11239"><span class="ln">11239 </span></a>
<a name="l11240"><span class="ln">11240 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though</span>
<a name="l11241"><span class="ln">11241 </span></a><span class="s0">he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have</span>
<a name="l11242"><span class="ln">11242 </span></a><span class="s0">a delightful evening.  They all walked about together, to see</span>
<a name="l11243"><span class="ln">11243 </span></a><span class="s0">that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes</span>
<a name="l11244"><span class="ln">11244 </span></a><span class="s0">were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma</span>
<a name="l11245"><span class="ln">11245 </span></a><span class="s0">could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize.</span>
<a name="l11246"><span class="ln">11246 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So unreasonably early!&quot; she was going to exclaim; but she presently</span>
<a name="l11247"><span class="ln">11247 </span></a><span class="s0">found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself,</span>
<a name="l11248"><span class="ln">11248 </span></a><span class="s0">by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they were</span>
<a name="l11249"><span class="ln">11249 </span></a><span class="s0">so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been</span>
<a name="l11250"><span class="ln">11250 </span></a><span class="s0">entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness,</span>
<a name="l11251"><span class="ln">11251 </span></a><span class="s0">on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might</span>
<a name="l11252"><span class="ln">11252 </span></a><span class="s0">soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.</span>
<a name="l11253"><span class="ln">11253 </span></a>
<a name="l11254"><span class="ln">11254 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which</span>
<a name="l11255"><span class="ln">11255 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and</span>
<a name="l11256"><span class="ln">11256 </span></a><span class="s0">intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes,</span>
<a name="l11257"><span class="ln">11257 </span></a><span class="s0">was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity.</span>
<a name="l11258"><span class="ln">11258 </span></a><span class="s0">She liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness</span>
<a name="l11259"><span class="ln">11259 </span></a><span class="s0">would have made him a higher character.--General benevolence,</span>
<a name="l11260"><span class="ln">11260 </span></a><span class="s0">but not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.--</span>
<a name="l11261"><span class="ln">11261 </span></a><span class="s0">She could fancy such a man.  The whole party walked about,</span>
<a name="l11262"><span class="ln">11262 </span></a><span class="s0">and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do,</span>
<a name="l11263"><span class="ln">11263 </span></a><span class="s0">formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their</span>
<a name="l11264"><span class="ln">11264 </span></a><span class="s0">various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_,</span>
<a name="l11265"><span class="ln">11265 </span></a><span class="s0">a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.</span>
<a name="l11266"><span class="ln">11266 </span></a>
<a name="l11267"><span class="ln">11267 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number</span>
<a name="l11268"><span class="ln">11268 </span></a><span class="s0">of privy councillors was not yet larger.  They had stopped</span>
<a name="l11269"><span class="ln">11269 </span></a><span class="s0">at Mrs. Bates's door to offer the use of their carriage,</span>
<a name="l11270"><span class="ln">11270 </span></a><span class="s0">but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons.</span>
<a name="l11271"><span class="ln">11271 </span></a>
<a name="l11272"><span class="ln">11272 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,</span>
<a name="l11273"><span class="ln">11273 </span></a><span class="s0">which shewed a mind not at ease.  He was looking about, he was going</span>
<a name="l11274"><span class="ln">11274 </span></a><span class="s0">to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--</span>
<a name="l11275"><span class="ln">11275 </span></a><span class="s0">impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.</span>
<a name="l11276"><span class="ln">11276 </span></a>
<a name="l11277"><span class="ln">11277 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton was spoken of.  &quot;I think she must be here soon,&quot; said he.</span>
<a name="l11278"><span class="ln">11278 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much</span>
<a name="l11279"><span class="ln">11279 </span></a><span class="s0">of her.  It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11280"><span class="ln">11280 </span></a>
<a name="l11281"><span class="ln">11281 </span></a><span class="s0">A carriage was heard.  He was on the move immediately;</span>
<a name="l11282"><span class="ln">11282 </span></a><span class="s0">but coming back, said,</span>
<a name="l11283"><span class="ln">11283 </span></a>
<a name="l11284"><span class="ln">11284 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her.  I have never seen</span>
<a name="l11285"><span class="ln">11285 </span></a><span class="s0">either Mr. or Mrs. Elton.  I have no business to put myself forward.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11286"><span class="ln">11286 </span></a>
<a name="l11287"><span class="ln">11287 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.</span>
<a name="l11288"><span class="ln">11288 </span></a>
<a name="l11289"><span class="ln">11289 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!&quot; said Mr. Weston, looking about.</span>
<a name="l11290"><span class="ln">11290 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We thought you were to bring them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11291"><span class="ln">11291 </span></a>
<a name="l11292"><span class="ln">11292 </span></a><span class="s0">The mistake had been slight.  The carriage was sent for them now.</span>
<a name="l11293"><span class="ln">11293 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton</span>
<a name="l11294"><span class="ln">11294 </span></a><span class="s0">might be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress,</span>
<a name="l11295"><span class="ln">11295 </span></a><span class="s0">and her smiles of graciousness.  He was immediately qualifying</span>
<a name="l11296"><span class="ln">11296 </span></a><span class="s0">himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention,</span>
<a name="l11297"><span class="ln">11297 </span></a><span class="s0">after the introduction had passed.</span>
<a name="l11298"><span class="ln">11298 </span></a>
<a name="l11299"><span class="ln">11299 </span></a><span class="s0">In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--</span>
<a name="l11300"><span class="ln">11300 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,&quot; said Frank to his father:</span>
<a name="l11301"><span class="ln">11301 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Miss Bates must not be forgotten:&quot;  and away he went.  Mr. Weston</span>
<a name="l11302"><span class="ln">11302 </span></a><span class="s0">was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her</span>
<a name="l11303"><span class="ln">11303 </span></a><span class="s0">opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young</span>
<a name="l11304"><span class="ln">11304 </span></a><span class="s0">man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out</span>
<a name="l11305"><span class="ln">11305 </span></a><span class="s0">of hearing.</span>
<a name="l11306"><span class="ln">11306 </span></a>
<a name="l11307"><span class="ln">11307 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston.  You know I candidly told</span>
<a name="l11308"><span class="ln">11308 </span></a><span class="s0">you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am</span>
<a name="l11309"><span class="ln">11309 </span></a><span class="s0">extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me.  I never compliment.</span>
<a name="l11310"><span class="ln">11310 </span></a><span class="s0">I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely</span>
<a name="l11311"><span class="ln">11311 </span></a><span class="s0">what I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least</span>
<a name="l11312"><span class="ln">11312 </span></a><span class="s0">conceit or puppyism.  You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--</span>
<a name="l11313"><span class="ln">11313 </span></a><span class="s0">quite a horror of them.  They were never tolerated at Maple Grove.</span>
<a name="l11314"><span class="ln">11314 </span></a><span class="s0">Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we</span>
<a name="l11315"><span class="ln">11315 </span></a><span class="s0">used sometimes to say very cutting things!  Selina, who is mild almost</span>
<a name="l11316"><span class="ln">11316 </span></a><span class="s0">to a fault, bore with them much better.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11317"><span class="ln">11317 </span></a>
<a name="l11318"><span class="ln">11318 </span></a><span class="s0">While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained;</span>
<a name="l11319"><span class="ln">11319 </span></a><span class="s0">but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were</span>
<a name="l11320"><span class="ln">11320 </span></a><span class="s0">ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must</span>
<a name="l11321"><span class="ln">11321 </span></a><span class="s0">hurry away.</span>
<a name="l11322"><span class="ln">11322 </span></a>
<a name="l11323"><span class="ln">11323 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston.  &quot;I have no doubt of its being</span>
<a name="l11324"><span class="ln">11324 </span></a><span class="s0">our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane.  Our coachman and horses are</span>
<a name="l11325"><span class="ln">11325 </span></a><span class="s0">so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--</span>
<a name="l11326"><span class="ln">11326 </span></a><span class="s0">What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--</span>
<a name="l11327"><span class="ln">11327 </span></a><span class="s0">I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it</span>
<a name="l11328"><span class="ln">11328 </span></a><span class="s0">will be quite unnecessary.  You may be very sure I shall always</span>
<a name="l11329"><span class="ln">11329 </span></a><span class="s0">take care of _them_.&quot;</span>

<a name="l11331"><span class="ln">11331 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen,</span>
<a name="l11332"><span class="ln">11332 </span></a><span class="s0">walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much</span>
<a name="l11333"><span class="ln">11333 </span></a><span class="s0">her duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them.  Her gestures and</span>
<a name="l11334"><span class="ln">11334 </span></a><span class="s0">movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma;</span>
<a name="l11335"><span class="ln">11335 </span></a><span class="s0">but her words, every body's words, were soon lost under the</span>
<a name="l11336"><span class="ln">11336 </span></a><span class="s0">incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not</span>
<a name="l11337"><span class="ln">11337 </span></a><span class="s0">finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted</span>
<a name="l11338"><span class="ln">11338 </span></a><span class="s0">into the circle at the fire.  As the door opened she was heard,</span>
<a name="l11339"><span class="ln">11339 </span></a>
<a name="l11340"><span class="ln">11340 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So very obliging of you!--No rain at all.  Nothing to signify.</span>
<a name="l11341"><span class="ln">11341 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not care for myself.  Quite thick shoes.  And Jane declares--</span>
<a name="l11342"><span class="ln">11342 </span></a><span class="s0">Well!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well!  This is brilliant</span>
<a name="l11343"><span class="ln">11343 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word.</span>
<a name="l11344"><span class="ln">11344 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing wanting.  Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--</span>
<a name="l11345"><span class="ln">11345 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing?  Oh!  Mr. Weston,</span>
<a name="l11346"><span class="ln">11346 </span></a><span class="s0">you must really have had Aladdin's lamp.  Good Mrs. Stokes</span>
<a name="l11347"><span class="ln">11347 </span></a><span class="s0">would not know her own room again.  I saw her as I came in;</span>
<a name="l11348"><span class="ln">11348 </span></a><span class="s0">she was standing in the entrance.  `Oh!  Mrs. Stokes,' said I--</span>
<a name="l11349"><span class="ln">11349 </span></a><span class="s0">but I had not time for more.&quot;  She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--</span>
<a name="l11350"><span class="ln">11350 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well.</span>
<a name="l11351"><span class="ln">11351 </span></a><span class="s0">Very happy to hear it.  So afraid you might have a headache!--</span>
<a name="l11352"><span class="ln">11352 </span></a><span class="s0">seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.</span>
<a name="l11353"><span class="ln">11353 </span></a><span class="s0">Delighted to hear it indeed.  Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged</span>
<a name="l11354"><span class="ln">11354 </span></a><span class="s0">to you for the carriage!--excellent time.  Jane and I quite ready.</span>
<a name="l11355"><span class="ln">11355 </span></a><span class="s0">Did not keep the horses a moment.  Most comfortable carriage.--</span>
<a name="l11356"><span class="ln">11356 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score.</span>
<a name="l11357"><span class="ln">11357 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.--</span>
<a name="l11358"><span class="ln">11358 </span></a><span class="s0">But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours.</span>
<a name="l11359"><span class="ln">11359 </span></a><span class="s0">I said to my mother, `Upon my word, ma'am--.'  Thank you, my mother</span>
<a name="l11360"><span class="ln">11360 </span></a><span class="s0">is remarkably well.  Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take</span>
<a name="l11361"><span class="ln">11361 </span></a><span class="s0">her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--</span>
<a name="l11362"><span class="ln">11362 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!</span>
<a name="l11363"><span class="ln">11363 </span></a><span class="s0">Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice.  There were</span>
<a name="l11364"><span class="ln">11364 </span></a><span class="s0">three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time.</span>
<a name="l11365"><span class="ln">11365 </span></a><span class="s0">Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive.  My dear Jane,</span>
<a name="l11366"><span class="ln">11366 </span></a><span class="s0">are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two,</span>
<a name="l11367"><span class="ln">11367 </span></a><span class="s0">but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--</span>
<a name="l11368"><span class="ln">11368 </span></a><span class="s0">and there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his</span>
<a name="l11369"><span class="ln">11369 </span></a><span class="s0">extreme politeness.--Oh!  Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you</span>
<a name="l11370"><span class="ln">11370 </span></a><span class="s0">my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet</span>
<a name="l11371"><span class="ln">11371 </span></a><span class="s0">never came out again.  My mother often talks of your good-nature.</span>
<a name="l11372"><span class="ln">11372 </span></a><span class="s0">Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?--</span>
<a name="l11373"><span class="ln">11373 </span></a><span class="s0">Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?--</span>
<a name="l11374"><span class="ln">11374 </span></a><span class="s0">Very well I thank you, quite well.  This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--</span>
<a name="l11375"><span class="ln">11375 </span></a><span class="s0">Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma</span>
<a name="l11376"><span class="ln">11376 </span></a><span class="s0">most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l11377"><span class="ln">11377 </span></a><span class="s0">you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.--</span>
<a name="l11378"><span class="ln">11378 </span></a><span class="s0">She did it all herself.  Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--</span>
<a name="l11379"><span class="ln">11379 </span></a><span class="s0">No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--</span>
<a name="l11380"><span class="ln">11380 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mrs. Hughes.  Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for</span>
<a name="l11381"><span class="ln">11381 </span></a><span class="s0">a moment.--How do you do?  How do you do?--Very well, I thank you.</span>
<a name="l11382"><span class="ln">11382 </span></a><span class="s0">This is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--</span>
<a name="l11383"><span class="ln">11383 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! there he is.  Don't disturb him.  Much better employed talking</span>
<a name="l11384"><span class="ln">11384 </span></a><span class="s0">to the young ladies.  How do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the</span>
<a name="l11385"><span class="ln">11385 </span></a><span class="s0">other day as you rode through the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--</span>
<a name="l11386"><span class="ln">11386 </span></a><span class="s0">and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host</span>
<a name="l11387"><span class="ln">11387 </span></a><span class="s0">of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do?  How do</span>
<a name="l11388"><span class="ln">11388 </span></a><span class="s0">you all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you.  Never better.--</span>
<a name="l11389"><span class="ln">11389 </span></a><span class="s0">Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the</span>
<a name="l11390"><span class="ln">11390 </span></a><span class="s0">worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about</span>
<a name="l11391"><span class="ln">11391 </span></a><span class="s0">among such friends!  And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted.</span>
<a name="l11392"><span class="ln">11392 </span></a><span class="s0">No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea</span>
<a name="l11393"><span class="ln">11393 </span></a><span class="s0">if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.</span>
<a name="l11394"><span class="ln">11394 </span></a><span class="s0">Every thing so good!&quot;</span>
<a name="l11395"><span class="ln">11395 </span></a>
<a name="l11396"><span class="ln">11396 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss</span>
<a name="l11397"><span class="ln">11397 </span></a><span class="s0">Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the</span>
<a name="l11398"><span class="ln">11398 </span></a><span class="s0">discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little</span>
<a name="l11399"><span class="ln">11399 </span></a><span class="s0">way behind her.--He was thoughtful.  Whether he were overhearing too,</span>
<a name="l11400"><span class="ln">11400 </span></a><span class="s0">she could not determine.  After a good many compliments to Jane</span>
<a name="l11401"><span class="ln">11401 </span></a><span class="s0">on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken,</span>
<a name="l11402"><span class="ln">11402 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--</span>
<a name="l11403"><span class="ln">11403 </span></a><span class="s0">and it was, &quot;How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--</span>
<a name="l11404"><span class="ln">11404 </span></a><span class="s0">How has Wright done my hair?&quot;--with many other relative questions,</span>
<a name="l11405"><span class="ln">11405 </span></a><span class="s0">all answered with patient politeness.  Mrs. Elton then said,</span>
<a name="l11406"><span class="ln">11406 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such</span>
<a name="l11407"><span class="ln">11407 </span></a><span class="s0">an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me,</span>
<a name="l11408"><span class="ln">11408 </span></a><span class="s0">and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving</span>
<a name="l11409"><span class="ln">11409 </span></a><span class="s0">this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior</span>
<a name="l11410"><span class="ln">11410 </span></a><span class="s0">to others.  And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.--</span>
<a name="l11411"><span class="ln">11411 </span></a><span class="s0">So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see</span>
<a name="l11412"><span class="ln">11412 </span></a><span class="s0">if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.</span>
<a name="l11413"><span class="ln">11413 </span></a><span class="s0">I like him very well.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11414"><span class="ln">11414 </span></a>
<a name="l11415"><span class="ln">11415 </span></a><span class="s0">At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could</span>
<a name="l11416"><span class="ln">11416 </span></a><span class="s0">not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want</span>
<a name="l11417"><span class="ln">11417 </span></a><span class="s0">to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while,</span>
<a name="l11418"><span class="ln">11418 </span></a><span class="s0">till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly</span>
<a name="l11419"><span class="ln">11419 </span></a><span class="s0">forward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,</span>
<a name="l11420"><span class="ln">11420 </span></a>
<a name="l11421"><span class="ln">11421 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--</span>
<a name="l11422"><span class="ln">11422 </span></a><span class="s0">I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be</span>
<a name="l11423"><span class="ln">11423 </span></a><span class="s0">impatient for tidings of us.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11424"><span class="ln">11424 </span></a>
<a name="l11425"><span class="ln">11425 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Jane!&quot;--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.--</span>
<a name="l11426"><span class="ln">11426 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11427"><span class="ln">11427 </span></a>
<a name="l11428"><span class="ln">11428 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How do you like Mrs. Elton?&quot; said Emma in a whisper.</span>
<a name="l11429"><span class="ln">11429 </span></a>
<a name="l11430"><span class="ln">11430 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not at all.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11431"><span class="ln">11431 </span></a>
<a name="l11432"><span class="ln">11432 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are ungrateful.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11433"><span class="ln">11433 </span></a>
<a name="l11434"><span class="ln">11434 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ungrateful!--What do you mean?&quot;  Then changing from a frown to</span>
<a name="l11435"><span class="ln">11435 </span></a><span class="s0">a smile--&quot;No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--</span>
<a name="l11436"><span class="ln">11436 </span></a><span class="s0">Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?&quot;</span>
<a name="l11437"><span class="ln">11437 </span></a>
<a name="l11438"><span class="ln">11438 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour.</span>
<a name="l11439"><span class="ln">11439 </span></a><span class="s0">He walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both</span>
<a name="l11440"><span class="ln">11440 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. and Mrs. Weston.  He had met with them in a little perplexity,</span>
<a name="l11441"><span class="ln">11441 </span></a><span class="s0">which must be laid before Emma.  It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l11442"><span class="ln">11442 </span></a><span class="s0">that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would</span>
<a name="l11443"><span class="ln">11443 </span></a><span class="s0">expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma</span>
<a name="l11444"><span class="ln">11444 </span></a><span class="s0">that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.</span>
<a name="l11445"><span class="ln">11445 </span></a>
<a name="l11446"><span class="ln">11446 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?&quot; said Mr. Weston.</span>
<a name="l11447"><span class="ln">11447 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She will think Frank ought to ask her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11448"><span class="ln">11448 </span></a>
<a name="l11449"><span class="ln">11449 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise;</span>
<a name="l11450"><span class="ln">11450 </span></a><span class="s0">and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most</span>
<a name="l11451"><span class="ln">11451 </span></a><span class="s0">perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was</span>
<a name="l11452"><span class="ln">11452 </span></a><span class="s0">wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business</span>
<a name="l11453"><span class="ln">11453 </span></a><span class="s0">was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--</span>
<a name="l11454"><span class="ln">11454 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss</span>
<a name="l11455"><span class="ln">11455 </span></a><span class="s0">Woodhouse followed.  Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,</span>
<a name="l11456"><span class="ln">11456 </span></a><span class="s0">though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.</span>
<a name="l11457"><span class="ln">11457 </span></a><span class="s0">It was almost enough to make her think of marrying.  Mrs. Elton had</span>
<a name="l11458"><span class="ln">11458 </span></a><span class="s0">undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified;</span>
<a name="l11459"><span class="ln">11459 </span></a><span class="s0">for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could</span>
<a name="l11460"><span class="ln">11460 </span></a><span class="s0">not lose by the change.  Mr. Weston might be his son's superior.--</span>
<a name="l11461"><span class="ln">11461 </span></a><span class="s0">In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment,</span>
<a name="l11462"><span class="ln">11462 </span></a><span class="s0">delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming,</span>
<a name="l11463"><span class="ln">11463 </span></a><span class="s0">and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--</span>
<a name="l11464"><span class="ln">11464 </span></a><span class="s0">She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any</span>
<a name="l11465"><span class="ln">11465 </span></a><span class="s0">thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not</span>
<a name="l11466"><span class="ln">11466 </span></a><span class="s0">to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands,</span>
<a name="l11467"><span class="ln">11467 </span></a><span class="s0">and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest</span>
<a name="l11468"><span class="ln">11468 </span></a><span class="s0">in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!--</span>
<a name="l11469"><span class="ln">11469 </span></a><span class="s0">He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere,</span>
<a name="l11470"><span class="ln">11470 </span></a><span class="s0">than where he had placed himself.  His tall, firm, upright figure,</span>
<a name="l11471"><span class="ln">11471 </span></a><span class="s0">among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men,</span>
<a name="l11472"><span class="ln">11472 </span></a><span class="s0">was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her</span>
<a name="l11473"><span class="ln">11473 </span></a><span class="s0">own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men</span>
<a name="l11474"><span class="ln">11474 </span></a><span class="s0">who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,</span>
<a name="l11475"><span class="ln">11475 </span></a><span class="s0">and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike</span>
<a name="l11476"><span class="ln">11476 </span></a><span class="s0">a manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he</span>
<a name="l11477"><span class="ln">11477 </span></a><span class="s0">but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him</span>
<a name="l11478"><span class="ln">11478 </span></a><span class="s0">to smile; but in general he was looking grave.  She wished he could</span>
<a name="l11479"><span class="ln">11479 </span></a><span class="s0">love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--</span>
<a name="l11480"><span class="ln">11480 </span></a><span class="s0">He seemed often observing her.  She must not flatter herself that he</span>
<a name="l11481"><span class="ln">11481 </span></a><span class="s0">thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour,</span>
<a name="l11482"><span class="ln">11482 </span></a><span class="s0">she did not feel afraid.  There was nothing like flirtation between</span>
<a name="l11483"><span class="ln">11483 </span></a><span class="s0">her and her partner.  They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends,</span>
<a name="l11484"><span class="ln">11484 </span></a><span class="s0">than lovers.  That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done,</span>
<a name="l11485"><span class="ln">11485 </span></a><span class="s0">was indubitable.</span>
<a name="l11486"><span class="ln">11486 </span></a>
<a name="l11487"><span class="ln">11487 </span></a><span class="s0">The ball proceeded pleasantly.  The anxious cares, the incessant</span>
<a name="l11488"><span class="ln">11488 </span></a><span class="s0">attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away.  Every body</span>
<a name="l11489"><span class="ln">11489 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball,</span>
<a name="l11490"><span class="ln">11490 </span></a><span class="s0">which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be,</span>
<a name="l11491"><span class="ln">11491 </span></a><span class="s0">was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this.</span>
<a name="l11492"><span class="ln">11492 </span></a><span class="s0">Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive</span>
<a name="l11493"><span class="ln">11493 </span></a><span class="s0">than such meetings usually are.  There was one, however, which Emma</span>
<a name="l11494"><span class="ln">11494 </span></a><span class="s0">thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun,</span>
<a name="l11495"><span class="ln">11495 </span></a><span class="s0">and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--</span>
<a name="l11496"><span class="ln">11496 </span></a><span class="s0">and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there</span>
<a name="l11497"><span class="ln">11497 </span></a><span class="s0">could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder</span>
<a name="l11498"><span class="ln">11498 </span></a><span class="s0">lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about.</span>
<a name="l11499"><span class="ln">11499 </span></a><span class="s0">He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided:</span>
<a name="l11500"><span class="ln">11500 </span></a><span class="s0">she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to</span>
<a name="l11501"><span class="ln">11501 </span></a><span class="s0">escape into the card-room.</span>
<a name="l11502"><span class="ln">11502 </span></a>
<a name="l11503"><span class="ln">11503 </span></a><span class="s0">Escape, however, was not his plan.  He came to the part of the room</span>
<a name="l11504"><span class="ln">11504 </span></a><span class="s0">where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about</span>
<a name="l11505"><span class="ln">11505 </span></a><span class="s0">in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution</span>
<a name="l11506"><span class="ln">11506 </span></a><span class="s0">of maintaining it.  He did not omit being sometimes directly</span>
<a name="l11507"><span class="ln">11507 </span></a><span class="s0">before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.--</span>
<a name="l11508"><span class="ln">11508 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma saw it.  She was not yet dancing; she was working her way</span>
<a name="l11509"><span class="ln">11509 </span></a><span class="s0">up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around,</span>
<a name="l11510"><span class="ln">11510 </span></a><span class="s0">and by only turning her head a little she saw it all.  When she was</span>
<a name="l11511"><span class="ln">11511 </span></a><span class="s0">half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she</span>
<a name="l11512"><span class="ln">11512 </span></a><span class="s0">would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near,</span>
<a name="l11513"><span class="ln">11513 </span></a><span class="s0">that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took</span>
<a name="l11514"><span class="ln">11514 </span></a><span class="s0">place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife,</span>
<a name="l11515"><span class="ln">11515 </span></a><span class="s0">who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also,</span>
<a name="l11516"><span class="ln">11516 </span></a><span class="s0">but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted,</span>
<a name="l11517"><span class="ln">11517 </span></a><span class="s0">gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, &quot;Do not</span>
<a name="l11518"><span class="ln">11518 </span></a><span class="s0">you dance, Mr. Elton?&quot; to which his prompt reply was, &quot;Most readily,</span>
<a name="l11519"><span class="ln">11519 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11520"><span class="ln">11520 </span></a>
<a name="l11521"><span class="ln">11521 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself.</span>
<a name="l11522"><span class="ln">11522 </span></a><span class="s0">I am no dancer.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11523"><span class="ln">11523 </span></a>
<a name="l11524"><span class="ln">11524 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,&quot; said he, &quot;I shall have great pleasure,</span>
<a name="l11525"><span class="ln">11525 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man,</span>
<a name="l11526"><span class="ln">11526 </span></a><span class="s0">and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great</span>
<a name="l11527"><span class="ln">11527 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11528"><span class="ln">11528 </span></a>
<a name="l11529"><span class="ln">11529 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady</span>
<a name="l11530"><span class="ln">11530 </span></a><span class="s0">disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11531"><span class="ln">11531 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--</span>
<a name="l11532"><span class="ln">11532 </span></a><span class="s0">and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over,</span>
<a name="l11533"><span class="ln">11533 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston.  You will excuse me.  Any thing else I should be most happy</span>
<a name="l11534"><span class="ln">11534 </span></a><span class="s0">to do, at your command--but my dancing days are over.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11535"><span class="ln">11535 </span></a>
<a name="l11536"><span class="ln">11536 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what</span>
<a name="l11537"><span class="ln">11537 </span></a><span class="s0">surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat.</span>
<a name="l11538"><span class="ln">11538 </span></a><span class="s0">This was Mr. Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--</span>
<a name="l11539"><span class="ln">11539 </span></a><span class="s0">She looked round for a moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a</span>
<a name="l11540"><span class="ln">11540 </span></a><span class="s0">little distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation,</span>
<a name="l11541"><span class="ln">11541 </span></a><span class="s0">while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife.</span>
<a name="l11542"><span class="ln">11542 </span></a>
<a name="l11543"><span class="ln">11543 </span></a><span class="s0">She would not look again.  Her heart was in a glow, and she feared</span>
<a name="l11544"><span class="ln">11544 </span></a><span class="s0">her face might be as hot.</span>
<a name="l11545"><span class="ln">11545 </span></a>
<a name="l11546"><span class="ln">11546 </span></a><span class="s0">In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l11547"><span class="ln">11547 </span></a><span class="s0">leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized,</span>
<a name="l11548"><span class="ln">11548 </span></a><span class="s0">seldom more delighted, than at that instant.  She was all pleasure</span>
<a name="l11549"><span class="ln">11549 </span></a><span class="s0">and gratitude, both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be</span>
<a name="l11550"><span class="ln">11550 </span></a><span class="s0">thanking him; and though too distant for speech, her countenance</span>
<a name="l11551"><span class="ln">11551 </span></a><span class="s0">said much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.</span>
<a name="l11552"><span class="ln">11552 </span></a>
<a name="l11553"><span class="ln">11553 </span></a><span class="s0">His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it,</span>
<a name="l11554"><span class="ln">11554 </span></a><span class="s0">extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky,</span>
<a name="l11555"><span class="ln">11555 </span></a><span class="s0">if it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for</span>
<a name="l11556"><span class="ln">11556 </span></a><span class="s0">the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction</span>
<a name="l11557"><span class="ln">11557 </span></a><span class="s0">which her happy features announced.  It was not thrown away on her,</span>
<a name="l11558"><span class="ln">11558 </span></a><span class="s0">she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle,</span>
<a name="l11559"><span class="ln">11559 </span></a><span class="s0">and was in a continual course of smiles.</span>
<a name="l11560"><span class="ln">11560 </span></a>
<a name="l11561"><span class="ln">11561 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted)</span>
<a name="l11562"><span class="ln">11562 </span></a><span class="s0">very foolish.  She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife,</span>
<a name="l11563"><span class="ln">11563 </span></a><span class="s0">though growing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings,</span>
<a name="l11564"><span class="ln">11564 </span></a><span class="s0">by observing audibly to her partner,</span>
<a name="l11565"><span class="ln">11565 </span></a>
<a name="l11566"><span class="ln">11566 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured,</span>
<a name="l11567"><span class="ln">11567 </span></a><span class="s0">I declare.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11568"><span class="ln">11568 </span></a>
<a name="l11569"><span class="ln">11569 </span></a><span class="s0">Supper was announced.  The move began; and Miss Bates might be</span>
<a name="l11570"><span class="ln">11570 </span></a><span class="s0">heard from that moment, without interruption, till her being</span>
<a name="l11571"><span class="ln">11571 </span></a><span class="s0">seated at table and taking up her spoon.</span>
<a name="l11572"><span class="ln">11572 </span></a>
<a name="l11573"><span class="ln">11573 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet.</span>
<a name="l11574"><span class="ln">11574 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet.  She says she is afraid</span>
<a name="l11575"><span class="ln">11575 </span></a><span class="s0">there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has</span>
<a name="l11576"><span class="ln">11576 </span></a><span class="s0">been done--One door nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane,</span>
<a name="l11577"><span class="ln">11577 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed you must.  Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging!</span>
<a name="l11578"><span class="ln">11578 </span></a><span class="s0">How well you put it on!--so gratified!  Excellent dancing indeed!--</span>
<a name="l11579"><span class="ln">11579 </span></a><span class="s0">Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama</span>
<a name="l11580"><span class="ln">11580 </span></a><span class="s0">to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.--I set off without</span>
<a name="l11581"><span class="ln">11581 </span></a><span class="s0">saying a word, just as I told you.  Grandmama was quite well,</span>
<a name="l11582"><span class="ln">11582 </span></a><span class="s0">had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat,</span>
<a name="l11583"><span class="ln">11583 </span></a><span class="s0">and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples</span>
<a name="l11584"><span class="ln">11584 </span></a><span class="s0">and wine before she came away:  amazing luck in some of her throws:</span>
<a name="l11585"><span class="ln">11585 </span></a><span class="s0">and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused,</span>
<a name="l11586"><span class="ln">11586 </span></a><span class="s0">and who were your partners.  `Oh!' said I, `I shall not forestall Jane;</span>
<a name="l11587"><span class="ln">11587 </span></a><span class="s0">I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you</span>
<a name="l11588"><span class="ln">11588 </span></a><span class="s0">all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,</span>
<a name="l11589"><span class="ln">11589 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.'</span>
<a name="l11590"><span class="ln">11590 </span></a><span class="s0">My dear sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would</span>
<a name="l11591"><span class="ln">11591 </span></a><span class="s0">not rather?--I am not helpless.  Sir, you are most kind.  Upon my word,</span>
<a name="l11592"><span class="ln">11592 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand</span>
<a name="l11593"><span class="ln">11593 </span></a><span class="s0">a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant</span>
<a name="l11594"><span class="ln">11594 </span></a><span class="s0">she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train.</span>
<a name="l11595"><span class="ln">11595 </span></a><span class="s0">Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage.</span>
<a name="l11596"><span class="ln">11596 </span></a><span class="s0">Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps.  Oh! no, there is</span>
<a name="l11597"><span class="ln">11597 </span></a><span class="s0">but one.  Well, I was persuaded there were two.  How very odd!</span>
<a name="l11598"><span class="ln">11598 </span></a><span class="s0">I was convinced there were two, and there is but one.  I never saw any</span>
<a name="l11599"><span class="ln">11599 </span></a><span class="s0">thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling</span>
<a name="l11600"><span class="ln">11600 </span></a><span class="s0">you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--</span>
<a name="l11601"><span class="ln">11601 </span></a><span class="s0">The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know;</span>
<a name="l11602"><span class="ln">11602 </span></a><span class="s0">but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus</span>
<a name="l11603"><span class="ln">11603 </span></a><span class="s0">brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the</span>
<a name="l11604"><span class="ln">11604 </span></a><span class="s0">asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again.  Now there</span>
<a name="l11605"><span class="ln">11605 </span></a><span class="s0">is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus--</span>
<a name="l11606"><span class="ln">11606 </span></a><span class="s0">so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it</span>
<a name="l11607"><span class="ln">11607 </span></a><span class="s0">to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l11608"><span class="ln">11608 </span></a><span class="s0">who would be so very much concerned!--Well, this is brilliant!</span>
<a name="l11609"><span class="ln">11609 </span></a><span class="s0">I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such</span>
<a name="l11610"><span class="ln">11610 </span></a><span class="s0">elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--</span>
<a name="l11611"><span class="ln">11611 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?  Anywhere, so that</span>
<a name="l11612"><span class="ln">11612 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane is not in a draught.  Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.</span>
<a name="l11613"><span class="ln">11613 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--</span>
<a name="l11614"><span class="ln">11614 </span></a><span class="s0">only it seems too good--but just as you please.  What you direct</span>
<a name="l11615"><span class="ln">11615 </span></a><span class="s0">in this house cannot be wrong.  Dear Jane, how shall we ever</span>
<a name="l11616"><span class="ln">11616 </span></a><span class="s0">recollect half the dishes for grandmama?  Soup too!  Bless me!</span>
<a name="l11617"><span class="ln">11617 </span></a><span class="s0">I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I</span>
<a name="l11618"><span class="ln">11618 </span></a><span class="s0">cannot help beginning.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11619"><span class="ln">11619 </span></a>
<a name="l11620"><span class="ln">11620 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till</span>
<a name="l11621"><span class="ln">11621 </span></a><span class="s0">after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again,</span>
<a name="l11622"><span class="ln">11622 </span></a><span class="s0">her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked.</span>
<a name="l11623"><span class="ln">11623 </span></a><span class="s0">He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been</span>
<a name="l11624"><span class="ln">11624 </span></a><span class="s0">unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due</span>
<a name="l11625"><span class="ln">11625 </span></a><span class="s0">share of censure.</span>
<a name="l11626"><span class="ln">11626 </span></a>
<a name="l11627"><span class="ln">11627 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,&quot; said he.  &quot;Emma, why</span>
<a name="l11628"><span class="ln">11628 </span></a><span class="s0">is it that they are your enemies?&quot;</span>
<a name="l11629"><span class="ln">11629 </span></a>
<a name="l11630"><span class="ln">11630 </span></a><span class="s0">He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving</span>
<a name="l11631"><span class="ln">11631 </span></a><span class="s0">no answer, added, &quot;_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect,</span>
<a name="l11632"><span class="ln">11632 </span></a><span class="s0">whatever he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course;</span>
<a name="l11633"><span class="ln">11633 </span></a><span class="s0">but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11634"><span class="ln">11634 </span></a>
<a name="l11635"><span class="ln">11635 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I did,&quot; replied Emma, &quot;and they cannot forgive me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11636"><span class="ln">11636 </span></a>
<a name="l11637"><span class="ln">11637 </span></a><span class="s0">He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it,</span>
<a name="l11638"><span class="ln">11638 </span></a><span class="s0">and he only said,</span>
<a name="l11639"><span class="ln">11639 </span></a>
<a name="l11640"><span class="ln">11640 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I shall not scold you.  I leave you to your own reflections.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11641"><span class="ln">11641 </span></a>
<a name="l11642"><span class="ln">11642 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever</span>
<a name="l11643"><span class="ln">11643 </span></a><span class="s0">tell me I am wrong?&quot;</span>
<a name="l11644"><span class="ln">11644 </span></a>
<a name="l11645"><span class="ln">11645 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads</span>
<a name="l11646"><span class="ln">11646 </span></a><span class="s0">you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11647"><span class="ln">11647 </span></a>
<a name="l11648"><span class="ln">11648 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.</span>
<a name="l11649"><span class="ln">11649 </span></a><span class="s0">There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I</span>
<a name="l11650"><span class="ln">11650 </span></a><span class="s0">did not:  and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.</span>
<a name="l11651"><span class="ln">11651 </span></a><span class="s0">It was through a series of strange blunders!&quot;</span>
<a name="l11652"><span class="ln">11652 </span></a>
<a name="l11653"><span class="ln">11653 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice</span>
<a name="l11654"><span class="ln">11654 </span></a><span class="s0">to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for</span>
<a name="l11655"><span class="ln">11655 </span></a><span class="s0">himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton</span>
<a name="l11656"><span class="ln">11656 </span></a><span class="s0">is totally without.  An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl--</span>
<a name="l11657"><span class="ln">11657 </span></a><span class="s0">infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such</span>
<a name="l11658"><span class="ln">11658 </span></a><span class="s0">a woman as Mrs. Elton.  I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11659"><span class="ln">11659 </span></a>
<a name="l11660"><span class="ln">11660 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle</span>
<a name="l11661"><span class="ln">11661 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.</span>
<a name="l11662"><span class="ln">11662 </span></a>
<a name="l11663"><span class="ln">11663 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?--</span>
<a name="l11664"><span class="ln">11664 </span></a><span class="s0">Come Emma, set your companions the example.  Every body is lazy!</span>
<a name="l11665"><span class="ln">11665 </span></a><span class="s0">Every body is asleep!&quot;</span>
<a name="l11666"><span class="ln">11666 </span></a>
<a name="l11667"><span class="ln">11667 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am ready,&quot; said Emma, &quot;whenever I am wanted.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11668"><span class="ln">11668 </span></a>
<a name="l11669"><span class="ln">11669 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Whom are you going to dance with?&quot; asked Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l11670"><span class="ln">11670 </span></a>
<a name="l11671"><span class="ln">11671 </span></a><span class="s0">She hesitated a moment, and then replied, &quot;With you, if you will</span>
<a name="l11672"><span class="ln">11672 </span></a><span class="s0">ask me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11673"><span class="ln">11673 </span></a>
<a name="l11674"><span class="ln">11674 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Will you?&quot; said he, offering his hand.</span>
<a name="l11675"><span class="ln">11675 </span></a>
<a name="l11676"><span class="ln">11676 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed I will.  You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we</span>
<a name="l11677"><span class="ln">11677 </span></a><span class="s0">are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11678"><span class="ln">11678 </span></a>
<a name="l11679"><span class="ln">11679 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Brother and sister! no, indeed.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11680"><span class="ln">11680 </span></a>
<a name="l11681"><span class="ln">11681 </span></a>
<a name="l11682"><span class="ln">11682 </span></a>
<a name="l11683"><span class="ln">11683 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER III</span>
<a name="l11684"><span class="ln">11684 </span></a>
<a name="l11685"><span class="ln">11685 </span></a>
<a name="l11686"><span class="ln">11686 </span></a><span class="s0">This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable</span>
<a name="l11687"><span class="ln">11687 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasure.  It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball,</span>
<a name="l11688"><span class="ln">11688 </span></a><span class="s0">which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was</span>
<a name="l11689"><span class="ln">11689 </span></a><span class="s0">extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting</span>
<a name="l11690"><span class="ln">11690 </span></a><span class="s0">the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so</span>
<a name="l11691"><span class="ln">11691 </span></a><span class="s0">much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour,</span>
<a name="l11692"><span class="ln">11692 </span></a><span class="s0">was peculiarly gratifying.  The impertinence of the Eltons, which for</span>
<a name="l11693"><span class="ln">11693 </span></a><span class="s0">a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been</span>
<a name="l11694"><span class="ln">11694 </span></a><span class="s0">the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked</span>
<a name="l11695"><span class="ln">11695 </span></a><span class="s0">forward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--</span>
<a name="l11696"><span class="ln">11696 </span></a><span class="s0">From Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they</span>
<a name="l11697"><span class="ln">11697 </span></a><span class="s0">quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes.  It seemed as if her eyes</span>
<a name="l11698"><span class="ln">11698 </span></a><span class="s0">were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l11699"><span class="ln">11699 </span></a><span class="s0">was not the superior creature she had believed him.  The fever</span>
<a name="l11700"><span class="ln">11700 </span></a><span class="s0">was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being</span>
<a name="l11701"><span class="ln">11701 </span></a><span class="s0">quickened again by injurious courtesy.  She depended on the evil</span>
<a name="l11702"><span class="ln">11702 </span></a><span class="s0">feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed</span>
<a name="l11703"><span class="ln">11703 </span></a><span class="s0">neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational,</span>
<a name="l11704"><span class="ln">11704 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not</span>
<a name="l11705"><span class="ln">11705 </span></a><span class="s0">wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!</span>
<a name="l11706"><span class="ln">11706 </span></a>
<a name="l11707"><span class="ln">11707 </span></a><span class="s0">She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.  He had told</span>
<a name="l11708"><span class="ln">11708 </span></a><span class="s0">her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping</span>
<a name="l11709"><span class="ln">11709 </span></a><span class="s0">at Hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day.</span>
<a name="l11710"><span class="ln">11710 </span></a><span class="s0">She did not regret it.</span>
<a name="l11711"><span class="ln">11711 </span></a>
<a name="l11712"><span class="ln">11712 </span></a><span class="s0">Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all</span>
<a name="l11713"><span class="ln">11713 </span></a><span class="s0">to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up</span>
<a name="l11714"><span class="ln">11714 </span></a><span class="s0">for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,</span>
<a name="l11715"><span class="ln">11715 </span></a><span class="s0">when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered</span>
<a name="l11716"><span class="ln">11716 </span></a><span class="s0">whom she had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill,</span>
<a name="l11717"><span class="ln">11717 </span></a><span class="s0">with Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment</span>
<a name="l11718"><span class="ln">11718 </span></a><span class="s0">sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.</span>
<a name="l11719"><span class="ln">11719 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--</span>
<a name="l11720"><span class="ln">11720 </span></a><span class="s0">The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--</span>
<a name="l11721"><span class="ln">11721 </span></a><span class="s0">they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking</span>
<a name="l11722"><span class="ln">11722 </span></a><span class="s0">into a chair fainted away.</span>
<a name="l11723"><span class="ln">11723 </span></a>
<a name="l11724"><span class="ln">11724 </span></a><span class="s0">A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,</span>
<a name="l11725"><span class="ln">11725 </span></a><span class="s0">and surprizes be explained.  Such events are very interesting,</span>
<a name="l11726"><span class="ln">11726 </span></a><span class="s0">but the suspense of them cannot last long.  A few minutes made Emma</span>
<a name="l11727"><span class="ln">11727 </span></a><span class="s0">acquainted with the whole.</span>
<a name="l11728"><span class="ln">11728 </span></a>
<a name="l11729"><span class="ln">11729 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at</span>
<a name="l11730"><span class="ln">11730 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together,</span>
<a name="l11731"><span class="ln">11731 </span></a><span class="s0">and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public</span>
<a name="l11732"><span class="ln">11732 </span></a><span class="s0">enough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile</span>
<a name="l11733"><span class="ln">11733 </span></a><span class="s0">beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms</span>
<a name="l11734"><span class="ln">11734 </span></a><span class="s0">on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired;</span>
<a name="l11735"><span class="ln">11735 </span></a><span class="s0">and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it,</span>
<a name="l11736"><span class="ln">11736 </span></a><span class="s0">they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them,</span>
<a name="l11737"><span class="ln">11737 </span></a><span class="s0">on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies.</span>
<a name="l11738"><span class="ln">11738 </span></a><span class="s0">A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,</span>
<a name="l11739"><span class="ln">11739 </span></a><span class="s0">excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet</span>
<a name="l11740"><span class="ln">11740 </span></a><span class="s0">to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top,</span>
<a name="l11741"><span class="ln">11741 </span></a><span class="s0">and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.</span>
<a name="l11742"><span class="ln">11742 </span></a><span class="s0">But poor Harriet could not follow.  She had suffered very much</span>
<a name="l11743"><span class="ln">11743 </span></a><span class="s0">from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank</span>
<a name="l11744"><span class="ln">11744 </span></a><span class="s0">brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--</span>
<a name="l11745"><span class="ln">11745 </span></a><span class="s0">and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged</span>
<a name="l11746"><span class="ln">11746 </span></a><span class="s0">to remain.</span>
<a name="l11747"><span class="ln">11747 </span></a>
<a name="l11748"><span class="ln">11748 </span></a><span class="s0">How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been</span>
<a name="l11749"><span class="ln">11749 </span></a><span class="s0">more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack</span>
<a name="l11750"><span class="ln">11750 </span></a><span class="s0">could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a</span>
<a name="l11751"><span class="ln">11751 </span></a><span class="s0">dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous,</span>
<a name="l11752"><span class="ln">11752 </span></a><span class="s0">and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and</span>
<a name="l11753"><span class="ln">11753 </span></a><span class="s0">more frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out</span>
<a name="l11754"><span class="ln">11754 </span></a><span class="s0">her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more,</span>
<a name="l11755"><span class="ln">11755 </span></a><span class="s0">or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly,</span>
<a name="l11756"><span class="ln">11756 </span></a><span class="s0">and was moving away--but her terror and her purse were too tempting,</span>
<a name="l11757"><span class="ln">11757 </span></a><span class="s0">and she was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang,</span>
<a name="l11758"><span class="ln">11758 </span></a><span class="s0">demanding more.</span>
<a name="l11759"><span class="ln">11759 </span></a>
<a name="l11760"><span class="ln">11760 </span></a><span class="s0">In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling</span>
<a name="l11761"><span class="ln">11761 </span></a><span class="s0">and conditioning, they loud and insolent.  By a most fortunate</span>
<a name="l11762"><span class="ln">11762 </span></a><span class="s0">chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him</span>
<a name="l11763"><span class="ln">11763 </span></a><span class="s0">to her assistance at this critical moment.  The pleasantness</span>
<a name="l11764"><span class="ln">11764 </span></a><span class="s0">of the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his</span>
<a name="l11765"><span class="ln">11765 </span></a><span class="s0">horses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury--</span>
<a name="l11766"><span class="ln">11766 </span></a><span class="s0">and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before</span>
<a name="l11767"><span class="ln">11767 </span></a><span class="s0">of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had</span>
<a name="l11768"><span class="ln">11768 </span></a><span class="s0">been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few minutes:</span>
<a name="l11769"><span class="ln">11769 </span></a><span class="s0">he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot,</span>
<a name="l11770"><span class="ln">11770 </span></a><span class="s0">was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them.</span>
<a name="l11771"><span class="ln">11771 </span></a><span class="s0">The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet</span>
<a name="l11772"><span class="ln">11772 </span></a><span class="s0">was then their own portion.  He had left them completely frightened;</span>
<a name="l11773"><span class="ln">11773 </span></a><span class="s0">and Harriet eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak,</span>
<a name="l11774"><span class="ln">11774 </span></a><span class="s0">had just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits</span>
<a name="l11775"><span class="ln">11775 </span></a><span class="s0">were quite overcome.  It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield:</span>
<a name="l11776"><span class="ln">11776 </span></a><span class="s0">he had thought of no other place.</span>
<a name="l11777"><span class="ln">11777 </span></a>
<a name="l11778"><span class="ln">11778 </span></a><span class="s0">This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and</span>
<a name="l11779"><span class="ln">11779 </span></a><span class="s0">of Harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--</span>
<a name="l11780"><span class="ln">11780 </span></a><span class="s0">He dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays</span>
<a name="l11781"><span class="ln">11781 </span></a><span class="s0">left him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give</span>
<a name="l11782"><span class="ln">11782 </span></a><span class="s0">assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there</span>
<a name="l11783"><span class="ln">11783 </span></a><span class="s0">being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l11784"><span class="ln">11784 </span></a><span class="s0">he set off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter</span>
<a name="l11785"><span class="ln">11785 </span></a><span class="s0">for her friend and herself.</span>
<a name="l11786"><span class="ln">11786 </span></a>
<a name="l11787"><span class="ln">11787 </span></a><span class="s0">Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young</span>
<a name="l11788"><span class="ln">11788 </span></a><span class="s0">woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting</span>
<a name="l11789"><span class="ln">11789 </span></a><span class="s0">certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.</span>
<a name="l11790"><span class="ln">11790 </span></a><span class="s0">So Emma thought, at least.  Could a linguist, could a grammarian,</span>
<a name="l11791"><span class="ln">11791 </span></a><span class="s0">could even a mathematician have seen what she did, have witnessed their</span>
<a name="l11792"><span class="ln">11792 </span></a><span class="s0">appearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling</span>
<a name="l11793"><span class="ln">11793 </span></a><span class="s0">that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting</span>
<a name="l11794"><span class="ln">11794 </span></a><span class="s0">to each other?--How much more must an imaginist, like herself,</span>
<a name="l11795"><span class="ln">11795 </span></a><span class="s0">be on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such</span>
<a name="l11796"><span class="ln">11796 </span></a><span class="s0">a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made.</span>
<a name="l11797"><span class="ln">11797 </span></a>
<a name="l11798"><span class="ln">11798 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a very extraordinary thing!  Nothing of the sort had ever</span>
<a name="l11799"><span class="ln">11799 </span></a><span class="s0">occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory;</span>
<a name="l11800"><span class="ln">11800 </span></a><span class="s0">no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened</span>
<a name="l11801"><span class="ln">11801 </span></a><span class="s0">to the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very</span>
<a name="l11802"><span class="ln">11802 </span></a><span class="s0">person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly</span>
<a name="l11803"><span class="ln">11803 </span></a><span class="s0">was very extraordinary!--And knowing, as she did, the favourable</span>
<a name="l11804"><span class="ln">11804 </span></a><span class="s0">state of mind of each at this period, it struck her the more.</span>
<a name="l11805"><span class="ln">11805 </span></a><span class="s0">He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself,</span>
<a name="l11806"><span class="ln">11806 </span></a><span class="s0">she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.  It seemed as if</span>
<a name="l11807"><span class="ln">11807 </span></a><span class="s0">every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences.</span>
<a name="l11808"><span class="ln">11808 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly</span>
<a name="l11809"><span class="ln">11809 </span></a><span class="s0">recommending each to the other.</span>
<a name="l11810"><span class="ln">11810 </span></a>
<a name="l11811"><span class="ln">11811 </span></a><span class="s0">In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him,</span>
<a name="l11812"><span class="ln">11812 </span></a><span class="s0">while Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,</span>
<a name="l11813"><span class="ln">11813 </span></a><span class="s0">her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a</span>
<a name="l11814"><span class="ln">11814 </span></a><span class="s0">sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's</span>
<a name="l11815"><span class="ln">11815 </span></a><span class="s0">own account had been given, he had expressed his indignation</span>
<a name="l11816"><span class="ln">11816 </span></a><span class="s0">at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms.</span>
<a name="l11817"><span class="ln">11817 </span></a><span class="s0">Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled</span>
<a name="l11818"><span class="ln">11818 </span></a><span class="s0">nor assisted.  She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint.</span>
<a name="l11819"><span class="ln">11819 </span></a><span class="s0">No, she had had enough of interference.  There could be no harm</span>
<a name="l11820"><span class="ln">11820 </span></a><span class="s0">in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.  It was no more than a wish.</span>
<a name="l11821"><span class="ln">11821 </span></a><span class="s0">Beyond it she would on no account proceed.</span>
<a name="l11822"><span class="ln">11822 </span></a>
<a name="l11823"><span class="ln">11823 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge</span>
<a name="l11824"><span class="ln">11824 </span></a><span class="s0">of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion:</span>
<a name="l11825"><span class="ln">11825 </span></a><span class="s0">but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible.  Within half</span>
<a name="l11826"><span class="ln">11826 </span></a><span class="s0">an hour it was known all over Highbury.  It was the very event</span>
<a name="l11827"><span class="ln">11827 </span></a><span class="s0">to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all</span>
<a name="l11828"><span class="ln">11828 </span></a><span class="s0">the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of</span>
<a name="l11829"><span class="ln">11829 </span></a><span class="s0">frightful news.  The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies.</span>
<a name="l11830"><span class="ln">11830 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen,</span>
<a name="l11831"><span class="ln">11831 </span></a><span class="s0">would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go</span>
<a name="l11832"><span class="ln">11832 </span></a><span class="s0">beyond the shrubbery again.  It was some comfort to him that many</span>
<a name="l11833"><span class="ln">11833 </span></a><span class="s0">inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours</span>
<a name="l11834"><span class="ln">11834 </span></a><span class="s0">knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith,</span>
<a name="l11835"><span class="ln">11835 </span></a><span class="s0">were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure</span>
<a name="l11836"><span class="ln">11836 </span></a><span class="s0">of returning for answer, that they were all very indifferent--</span>
<a name="l11837"><span class="ln">11837 </span></a><span class="s0">which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,</span>
<a name="l11838"><span class="ln">11838 </span></a><span class="s0">and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with.</span>
<a name="l11839"><span class="ln">11839 </span></a><span class="s0">She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such</span>
<a name="l11840"><span class="ln">11840 </span></a><span class="s0">a man, for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not</span>
<a name="l11841"><span class="ln">11841 </span></a><span class="s0">invent illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.</span>
<a name="l11842"><span class="ln">11842 </span></a>
<a name="l11843"><span class="ln">11843 </span></a><span class="s0">The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took</span>
<a name="l11844"><span class="ln">11844 </span></a><span class="s0">themselves off in a hurry.  The young ladies of Highbury might have</span>
<a name="l11845"><span class="ln">11845 </span></a><span class="s0">walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole</span>
<a name="l11846"><span class="ln">11846 </span></a><span class="s0">history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma</span>
<a name="l11847"><span class="ln">11847 </span></a><span class="s0">and her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground,</span>
<a name="l11848"><span class="ln">11848 </span></a><span class="s0">and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of</span>
<a name="l11849"><span class="ln">11849 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right</span>
<a name="l11850"><span class="ln">11850 </span></a><span class="s0">if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.</span>
<a name="l11851"><span class="ln">11851 </span></a>

<a name="l11855"><span class="ln">11855 </span></a>
<a name="l11856"><span class="ln">11856 </span></a>
<a name="l11857"><span class="ln">11857 </span></a><span class="s0">A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came</span>
<a name="l11858"><span class="ln">11858 </span></a><span class="s0">one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after</span>
<a name="l11859"><span class="ln">11859 </span></a><span class="s0">sitting down and hesitating, thus began:</span>
<a name="l11860"><span class="ln">11860 </span></a>
<a name="l11861"><span class="ln">11861 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I</span>
<a name="l11862"><span class="ln">11862 </span></a><span class="s0">should like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then,</span>
<a name="l11863"><span class="ln">11863 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, it will be over.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11864"><span class="ln">11864 </span></a>
<a name="l11865"><span class="ln">11865 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak.</span>
<a name="l11866"><span class="ln">11866 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her,</span>
<a name="l11867"><span class="ln">11867 </span></a><span class="s0">quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary.</span>
<a name="l11868"><span class="ln">11868 </span></a>
<a name="l11869"><span class="ln">11869 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,&quot; she continued,</span>
<a name="l11870"><span class="ln">11870 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;to have no reserves with you on this subject.  As I am happily</span>
<a name="l11871"><span class="ln">11871 </span></a><span class="s0">quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you</span>
<a name="l11872"><span class="ln">11872 </span></a><span class="s0">should have the satisfaction of knowing it.  I do not want to say</span>
<a name="l11873"><span class="ln">11873 </span></a><span class="s0">more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way</span>
<a name="l11874"><span class="ln">11874 </span></a><span class="s0">as I have done, and I dare say you understand me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11875"><span class="ln">11875 </span></a>
<a name="l11876"><span class="ln">11876 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Emma, &quot;I hope I do.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11877"><span class="ln">11877 </span></a>
<a name="l11878"><span class="ln">11878 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . .&quot;</span>
<a name="l11879"><span class="ln">11879 </span></a><span class="s0">cried Harriet, warmly.  &quot;It seems like madness!  I can see nothing</span>
<a name="l11880"><span class="ln">11880 </span></a><span class="s0">at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet</span>
<a name="l11881"><span class="ln">11881 </span></a><span class="s0">him or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him--</span>
<a name="l11882"><span class="ln">11882 </span></a><span class="s0">and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him--but I do</span>
<a name="l11883"><span class="ln">11883 </span></a><span class="s0">not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her nor envy her,</span>
<a name="l11884"><span class="ln">11884 </span></a><span class="s0">as I have done:  she is very charming, I dare say, and all that,</span>
<a name="l11885"><span class="ln">11885 </span></a><span class="s0">but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall never forget</span>
<a name="l11886"><span class="ln">11886 </span></a><span class="s0">her look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l11887"><span class="ln">11887 </span></a><span class="s0">I wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,</span>
<a name="l11888"><span class="ln">11888 </span></a><span class="s0">it will not give me another moment's pang:  and to convince you</span>
<a name="l11889"><span class="ln">11889 </span></a><span class="s0">that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I</span>
<a name="l11890"><span class="ln">11890 </span></a><span class="s0">ought to have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--</span>
<a name="l11891"><span class="ln">11891 </span></a><span class="s0">I know that very well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I</span>
<a name="l11892"><span class="ln">11892 </span></a><span class="s0">will destroy it all--and it is my particular wish to do it</span>
<a name="l11893"><span class="ln">11893 </span></a><span class="s0">in your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown.</span>
<a name="l11894"><span class="ln">11894 </span></a><span class="s0">Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?&quot; said she, with a conscious look.</span>
<a name="l11895"><span class="ln">11895 </span></a>
<a name="l11896"><span class="ln">11896 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?&quot;</span>
<a name="l11897"><span class="ln">11897 </span></a>
<a name="l11898"><span class="ln">11898 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have</span>
<a name="l11899"><span class="ln">11899 </span></a><span class="s0">valued very much.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11900"><span class="ln">11900 </span></a>
<a name="l11901"><span class="ln">11901 </span></a><span class="s0">She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_</span>
<a name="l11902"><span class="ln">11902 </span></a><span class="s0">_precious_ _treasures_ on the top.  Her curiosity was greatly excited.</span>
<a name="l11903"><span class="ln">11903 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience.</span>
<a name="l11904"><span class="ln">11904 </span></a><span class="s0">Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,</span>
<a name="l11905"><span class="ln">11905 </span></a><span class="s0">which Harriet opened:  it was well lined with the softest cotton;</span>
<a name="l11906"><span class="ln">11906 </span></a><span class="s0">but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.</span>
<a name="l11907"><span class="ln">11907 </span></a>
<a name="l11908"><span class="ln">11908 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Now,&quot; said Harriet, &quot;you _must_ recollect.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11909"><span class="ln">11909 </span></a>
<a name="l11910"><span class="ln">11910 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, indeed I do not.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11911"><span class="ln">11911 </span></a>
<a name="l11912"><span class="ln">11912 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Dear me!  I should not have thought it possible you could forget</span>
<a name="l11913"><span class="ln">11913 </span></a><span class="s0">what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very</span>
<a name="l11914"><span class="ln">11914 </span></a><span class="s0">last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I</span>
<a name="l11915"><span class="ln">11915 </span></a><span class="s0">had my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--</span>
<a name="l11916"><span class="ln">11916 </span></a><span class="s0">I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger</span>
<a name="l11917"><span class="ln">11917 </span></a><span class="s0">with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--</span>
<a name="l11918"><span class="ln">11918 </span></a><span class="s0">But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired</span>
<a name="l11919"><span class="ln">11919 </span></a><span class="s0">me to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece;</span>
<a name="l11920"><span class="ln">11920 </span></a><span class="s0">but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept</span>
<a name="l11921"><span class="ln">11921 </span></a><span class="s0">playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me.</span>
<a name="l11922"><span class="ln">11922 </span></a><span class="s0">And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--</span>
<a name="l11923"><span class="ln">11923 </span></a><span class="s0">so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then</span>
<a name="l11924"><span class="ln">11924 </span></a><span class="s0">as a great treat.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11925"><span class="ln">11925 </span></a>
<a name="l11926"><span class="ln">11926 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dearest Harriet!&quot; cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,</span>
<a name="l11927"><span class="ln">11927 </span></a><span class="s0">and jumping up, &quot;you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.</span>
<a name="l11928"><span class="ln">11928 </span></a><span class="s0">Remember it?  Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving</span>
<a name="l11929"><span class="ln">11929 </span></a><span class="s0">this relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting</span>
<a name="l11930"><span class="ln">11930 </span></a><span class="s0">the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none</span>
<a name="l11931"><span class="ln">11931 </span></a><span class="s0">about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in</span>
<a name="l11932"><span class="ln">11932 </span></a><span class="s0">my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a</span>
<a name="l11933"><span class="ln">11933 </span></a><span class="s0">continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--</span>
<a name="l11934"><span class="ln">11934 </span></a><span class="s0">go on--what else?&quot;</span>
<a name="l11935"><span class="ln">11935 </span></a>
<a name="l11936"><span class="ln">11936 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And had you really some at hand yourself?  I am sure I never</span>
<a name="l11937"><span class="ln">11937 </span></a><span class="s0">suspected it, you did it so naturally.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11938"><span class="ln">11938 </span></a>
<a name="l11939"><span class="ln">11939 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!&quot;</span>
<a name="l11940"><span class="ln">11940 </span></a><span class="s0">said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided</span>
<a name="l11941"><span class="ln">11941 </span></a><span class="s0">between wonder and amusement.  And secretly she added to herself,</span>
<a name="l11942"><span class="ln">11942 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton</span>
<a name="l11943"><span class="ln">11943 </span></a><span class="s0">a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about!</span>
<a name="l11944"><span class="ln">11944 </span></a><span class="s0">I never was equal to this.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11945"><span class="ln">11945 </span></a>
<a name="l11946"><span class="ln">11946 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Here,&quot; resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, &quot;here is</span>
<a name="l11947"><span class="ln">11947 </span></a><span class="s0">something still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable,</span>
<a name="l11948"><span class="ln">11948 </span></a><span class="s0">because this is what did really once belong to him, which the</span>
<a name="l11949"><span class="ln">11949 </span></a><span class="s0">court-plaister never did.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11950"><span class="ln">11950 </span></a>
<a name="l11951"><span class="ln">11951 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.  It was the end</span>
<a name="l11952"><span class="ln">11952 </span></a><span class="s0">of an old pencil,--the part without any lead.</span>
<a name="l11953"><span class="ln">11953 </span></a>
<a name="l11954"><span class="ln">11954 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This was really his,&quot; said Harriet.--&quot;Do not you remember</span>
<a name="l11955"><span class="ln">11955 </span></a><span class="s0">one morning?--no, I dare say you do not.  But one morning--I forget</span>
<a name="l11956"><span class="ln">11956 </span></a><span class="s0">exactly the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before</span>
<a name="l11957"><span class="ln">11957 </span></a><span class="s0">_that_ _evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book;</span>
<a name="l11958"><span class="ln">11958 </span></a><span class="s0">it was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him</span>
<a name="l11959"><span class="ln">11959 </span></a><span class="s0">something about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down;</span>
<a name="l11960"><span class="ln">11960 </span></a><span class="s0">but when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he</span>
<a name="l11961"><span class="ln">11961 </span></a><span class="s0">soon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another,</span>
<a name="l11962"><span class="ln">11962 </span></a><span class="s0">and this was left upon the table as good for nothing.  But I kept</span>
<a name="l11963"><span class="ln">11963 </span></a><span class="s0">my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never</span>
<a name="l11964"><span class="ln">11964 </span></a><span class="s0">parted with it again from that moment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11965"><span class="ln">11965 </span></a>
<a name="l11966"><span class="ln">11966 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do remember it,&quot; cried Emma; &quot;I perfectly remember it.--</span>
<a name="l11967"><span class="ln">11967 </span></a><span class="s0">Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we</span>
<a name="l11968"><span class="ln">11968 </span></a><span class="s0">liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too.</span>
<a name="l11969"><span class="ln">11969 </span></a><span class="s0">I perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here,</span>
<a name="l11970"><span class="ln">11970 </span></a><span class="s0">was not he?  I have an idea he was standing just here.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11971"><span class="ln">11971 </span></a>
<a name="l11972"><span class="ln">11972 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!  I do not know.  I cannot recollect.--It is very odd,</span>
<a name="l11973"><span class="ln">11973 </span></a><span class="s0">but I cannot recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember,</span>
<a name="l11974"><span class="ln">11974 </span></a><span class="s0">much about where I am now.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l11975"><span class="ln">11975 </span></a>
<a name="l11976"><span class="ln">11976 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, go on.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11977"><span class="ln">11977 </span></a>
<a name="l11978"><span class="ln">11978 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! that's all.  I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--</span>
<a name="l11979"><span class="ln">11979 </span></a><span class="s0">except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire,</span>
<a name="l11980"><span class="ln">11980 </span></a><span class="s0">and I wish you to see me do it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11981"><span class="ln">11981 </span></a>
<a name="l11982"><span class="ln">11982 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness</span>
<a name="l11983"><span class="ln">11983 </span></a><span class="s0">in treasuring up these things?&quot;</span>
<a name="l11984"><span class="ln">11984 </span></a>
<a name="l11985"><span class="ln">11985 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish</span>
<a name="l11986"><span class="ln">11986 </span></a><span class="s0">I could forget as easily as I can burn them.  It was very wrong</span>
<a name="l11987"><span class="ln">11987 </span></a><span class="s0">of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married.</span>
<a name="l11988"><span class="ln">11988 </span></a><span class="s0">I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11989"><span class="ln">11989 </span></a>
<a name="l11990"><span class="ln">11990 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have</span>
<a name="l11991"><span class="ln">11991 </span></a><span class="s0">not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister</span>
<a name="l11992"><span class="ln">11992 </span></a><span class="s0">might be useful.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11993"><span class="ln">11993 </span></a>
<a name="l11994"><span class="ln">11994 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I shall be happier to burn it,&quot; replied Harriet.  &quot;It has</span>
<a name="l11995"><span class="ln">11995 </span></a><span class="s0">a disagreeable look to me.  I must get rid of every thing.--</span>
<a name="l11996"><span class="ln">11996 </span></a><span class="s0">There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.&quot;</span>
<a name="l11997"><span class="ln">11997 </span></a>
<a name="l11998"><span class="ln">11998 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And when,&quot; thought Emma, &quot;will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?&quot;</span>
<a name="l11999"><span class="ln">11999 </span></a>
<a name="l12000"><span class="ln">12000 </span></a><span class="s0">She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was</span>
<a name="l12001"><span class="ln">12001 </span></a><span class="s0">already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had</span>
<a name="l12002"><span class="ln">12002 </span></a><span class="s0">_told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a</span>
<a name="l12003"><span class="ln">12003 </span></a><span class="s0">fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation,</span>
<a name="l12004"><span class="ln">12004 </span></a><span class="s0">and quite undesignedly.  Emma was not thinking of it at the moment,</span>
<a name="l12005"><span class="ln">12005 </span></a><span class="s0">which made the information she received more valuable.</span>
<a name="l12006"><span class="ln">12006 </span></a><span class="s0">She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, &quot;Well, Harriet,</span>
<a name="l12007"><span class="ln">12007 </span></a><span class="s0">whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so&quot;--and thought</span>
<a name="l12008"><span class="ln">12008 </span></a><span class="s0">no more of it, till after a minute's silence she heard Harriet</span>
<a name="l12009"><span class="ln">12009 </span></a><span class="s0">say in a very serious tone, &quot;I shall never marry.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12010"><span class="ln">12010 </span></a>
<a name="l12011"><span class="ln">12011 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a</span>
<a name="l12012"><span class="ln">12012 </span></a><span class="s0">moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,</span>
<a name="l12013"><span class="ln">12013 </span></a>
<a name="l12014"><span class="ln">12014 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Never marry!--This is a new resolution.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12015"><span class="ln">12015 </span></a>
<a name="l12016"><span class="ln">12016 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is one that I shall never change, however.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12017"><span class="ln">12017 </span></a>
<a name="l12018"><span class="ln">12018 </span></a><span class="s0">After another short hesitation, &quot;I hope it does not proceed from--</span>
<a name="l12019"><span class="ln">12019 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12020"><span class="ln">12020 </span></a>
<a name="l12021"><span class="ln">12021 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Elton indeed!&quot; cried Harriet indignantly.--&quot;Oh! no&quot;--and Emma</span>
<a name="l12022"><span class="ln">12022 </span></a><span class="s0">could just catch the words, &quot;so superior to Mr. Elton!&quot;</span>
<a name="l12023"><span class="ln">12023 </span></a>
<a name="l12024"><span class="ln">12024 </span></a><span class="s0">She then took a longer time for consideration.  Should she proceed</span>
<a name="l12025"><span class="ln">12025 </span></a><span class="s0">no farther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--</span>
<a name="l12026"><span class="ln">12026 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did;</span>
<a name="l12027"><span class="ln">12027 </span></a><span class="s0">or perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive</span>
<a name="l12028"><span class="ln">12028 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing</span>
<a name="l12029"><span class="ln">12029 </span></a><span class="s0">like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent</span>
<a name="l12030"><span class="ln">12030 </span></a><span class="s0">discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.--</span>
<a name="l12031"><span class="ln">12031 </span></a><span class="s0">She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once,</span>
<a name="l12032"><span class="ln">12032 </span></a><span class="s0">all that she meant to say and know.  Plain dealing was always best.</span>
<a name="l12033"><span class="ln">12033 </span></a><span class="s0">She had previously determined how far she would proceed,</span>
<a name="l12034"><span class="ln">12034 </span></a><span class="s0">on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both,</span>
<a name="l12035"><span class="ln">12035 </span></a><span class="s0">to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--</span>
<a name="l12036"><span class="ln">12036 </span></a><span class="s0">She was decided, and thus spoke--</span>
<a name="l12037"><span class="ln">12037 </span></a>
<a name="l12038"><span class="ln">12038 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning.</span>
<a name="l12039"><span class="ln">12039 </span></a><span class="s0">Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying,</span>
<a name="l12040"><span class="ln">12040 </span></a><span class="s0">results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer,</span>
<a name="l12041"><span class="ln">12041 </span></a><span class="s0">would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you.</span>
<a name="l12042"><span class="ln">12042 </span></a><span class="s0">Is not it so?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12043"><span class="ln">12043 </span></a>
<a name="l12044"><span class="ln">12044 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--</span>
<a name="l12045"><span class="ln">12045 </span></a><span class="s0">Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him</span>
<a name="l12046"><span class="ln">12046 </span></a><span class="s0">at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all</span>
<a name="l12047"><span class="ln">12047 </span></a><span class="s0">the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration,</span>
<a name="l12048"><span class="ln">12048 </span></a><span class="s0">which are so proper, in me especially.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12049"><span class="ln">12049 </span></a>
<a name="l12050"><span class="ln">12050 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet.  The service he rendered</span>
<a name="l12051"><span class="ln">12051 </span></a><span class="s0">you was enough to warm your heart.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12052"><span class="ln">12052 </span></a>
<a name="l12053"><span class="ln">12053 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--</span>
<a name="l12054"><span class="ln">12054 </span></a><span class="s0">The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--</span>
<a name="l12055"><span class="ln">12055 </span></a><span class="s0">when I saw him coming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before.</span>
<a name="l12056"><span class="ln">12056 </span></a><span class="s0">Such a change!  In one moment such a change!  From perfect misery</span>
<a name="l12057"><span class="ln">12057 </span></a><span class="s0">to perfect happiness!&quot;</span>
<a name="l12058"><span class="ln">12058 </span></a>
<a name="l12059"><span class="ln">12059 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is very natural.  It is natural, and it is honourable.--</span>
<a name="l12060"><span class="ln">12060 </span></a><span class="s0">Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--</span>
<a name="l12061"><span class="ln">12061 </span></a><span class="s0">But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise.</span>
<a name="l12062"><span class="ln">12062 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet.  I do not by any</span>
<a name="l12063"><span class="ln">12063 </span></a><span class="s0">means engage for its being returned.  Consider what you are about.</span>
<a name="l12064"><span class="ln">12064 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can:</span>
<a name="l12065"><span class="ln">12065 </span></a><span class="s0">at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded</span>
<a name="l12066"><span class="ln">12066 </span></a><span class="s0">of his liking you.  Be observant of him.  Let his behaviour be the</span>
<a name="l12067"><span class="ln">12067 </span></a><span class="s0">guide of your sensations.  I give you this caution now, because I</span>
<a name="l12068"><span class="ln">12068 </span></a><span class="s0">shall never speak to you again on the subject.  I am determined</span>
<a name="l12069"><span class="ln">12069 </span></a><span class="s0">against all interference.  Henceforward I know nothing of the matter.</span>
<a name="l12070"><span class="ln">12070 </span></a><span class="s0">Let no name ever pass our lips.  We were very wrong before;</span>
<a name="l12071"><span class="ln">12071 </span></a><span class="s0">we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there</span>
<a name="l12072"><span class="ln">12072 </span></a><span class="s0">do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature;</span>
<a name="l12073"><span class="ln">12073 </span></a><span class="s0">but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have</span>
<a name="l12074"><span class="ln">12074 </span></a><span class="s0">been matches of greater disparity.  But take care of yourself.</span>
<a name="l12075"><span class="ln">12075 </span></a><span class="s0">I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end,</span>
<a name="l12076"><span class="ln">12076 </span></a><span class="s0">be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste</span>
<a name="l12077"><span class="ln">12077 </span></a><span class="s0">which I shall always know how to value.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12078"><span class="ln">12078 </span></a>
<a name="l12079"><span class="ln">12079 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.</span>
<a name="l12080"><span class="ln">12080 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing</span>
<a name="l12081"><span class="ln">12081 </span></a><span class="s0">for her friend.  Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind--</span>
<a name="l12082"><span class="ln">12082 </span></a><span class="s0">and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation.</span>

<a name="l12089"><span class="ln">12089 </span></a><span class="s0">In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened</span>
<a name="l12090"><span class="ln">12090 </span></a><span class="s0">upon Hartfield.  To Highbury in general it brought no material change.</span>
<a name="l12091"><span class="ln">12091 </span></a><span class="s0">The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings,</span>
<a name="l12092"><span class="ln">12092 </span></a><span class="s0">and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax</span>
<a name="l12093"><span class="ln">12093 </span></a><span class="s0">was still at her grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells</span>
<a name="l12094"><span class="ln">12094 </span></a><span class="s0">from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer,</span>
<a name="l12095"><span class="ln">12095 </span></a><span class="s0">fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer,</span>
<a name="l12096"><span class="ln">12096 </span></a><span class="s0">provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity</span>
<a name="l12097"><span class="ln">12097 </span></a><span class="s0">in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful</span>
<a name="l12098"><span class="ln">12098 </span></a><span class="s0">situation against her will.</span>
<a name="l12099"><span class="ln">12099 </span></a>
<a name="l12100"><span class="ln">12100 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly</span>
<a name="l12101"><span class="ln">12101 </span></a><span class="s0">taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike</span>
<a name="l12102"><span class="ln">12102 </span></a><span class="s0">him more.  He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his</span>
<a name="l12103"><span class="ln">12103 </span></a><span class="s0">pursuit of Emma.  That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.</span>
<a name="l12104"><span class="ln">12104 </span></a><span class="s0">Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints,</span>
<a name="l12105"><span class="ln">12105 </span></a><span class="s0">his mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison;</span>
<a name="l12106"><span class="ln">12106 </span></a><span class="s0">words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story.</span>
<a name="l12107"><span class="ln">12107 </span></a><span class="s0">But while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him</span>
<a name="l12108"><span class="ln">12108 </span></a><span class="s0">over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination</span>
<a name="l12109"><span class="ln">12109 </span></a><span class="s0">to trifle with Jane Fairfax.  He could not understand it; but there</span>
<a name="l12110"><span class="ln">12110 </span></a><span class="s0">were symptoms of intelligence between them--he thought so at least--</span>
<a name="l12111"><span class="ln">12111 </span></a><span class="s0">symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed,</span>
<a name="l12112"><span class="ln">12112 </span></a><span class="s0">he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning,</span>
<a name="l12113"><span class="ln">12113 </span></a><span class="s0">however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination.</span>
<a name="l12114"><span class="ln">12114 </span></a><span class="s0">_She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.  He was dining</span>
<a name="l12115"><span class="ln">12115 </span></a><span class="s0">with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he had</span>
<a name="l12116"><span class="ln">12116 </span></a><span class="s0">seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which,</span>
<a name="l12117"><span class="ln">12117 </span></a><span class="s0">from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place.</span>
<a name="l12118"><span class="ln">12118 </span></a><span class="s0">When he was again in their company, he could not help remembering</span>
<a name="l12119"><span class="ln">12119 </span></a><span class="s0">what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless it</span>
<a name="l12120"><span class="ln">12120 </span></a><span class="s0">were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,</span>
<a name="l12121"><span class="ln">12121 </span></a>
<a name="l12122"><span class="ln">12122 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Myself creating what I saw,&quot;</span>
<a name="l12123"><span class="ln">12123 </span></a>
<a name="l12124"><span class="ln">12124 </span></a><span class="s0">brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something</span>
<a name="l12125"><span class="ln">12125 </span></a><span class="s0">of private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank</span>
<a name="l12126"><span class="ln">12126 </span></a><span class="s0">Churchill and Jane.</span>
<a name="l12127"><span class="ln">12127 </span></a>
<a name="l12128"><span class="ln">12128 </span></a><span class="s0">He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did,</span>
<a name="l12129"><span class="ln">12129 </span></a><span class="s0">to spend his evening at Hartfield.  Emma and Harriet were going</span>
<a name="l12130"><span class="ln">12130 </span></a><span class="s0">to walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a</span>
<a name="l12131"><span class="ln">12131 </span></a><span class="s0">larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their</span>
<a name="l12132"><span class="ln">12132 </span></a><span class="s0">exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l12133"><span class="ln">12133 </span></a><span class="s0">and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met.</span>
<a name="l12134"><span class="ln">12134 </span></a><span class="s0">They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it</span>
<a name="l12135"><span class="ln">12135 </span></a><span class="s0">was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father,</span>
<a name="l12136"><span class="ln">12136 </span></a><span class="s0">pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him.  The Randalls</span>
<a name="l12137"><span class="ln">12137 </span></a><span class="s0">party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech</span>
<a name="l12138"><span class="ln">12138 </span></a><span class="s0">from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it</span>
<a name="l12139"><span class="ln">12139 </span></a><span class="s0">possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation.</span>
<a name="l12140"><span class="ln">12140 </span></a>
<a name="l12141"><span class="ln">12141 </span></a><span class="s0">As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.</span>
<a name="l12142"><span class="ln">12142 </span></a><span class="s0">The gentlemen spoke of his horse.</span>
<a name="l12143"><span class="ln">12143 </span></a>
<a name="l12144"><span class="ln">12144 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;By the bye,&quot; said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently,</span>
<a name="l12145"><span class="ln">12145 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12146"><span class="ln">12146 </span></a>
<a name="l12147"><span class="ln">12147 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, &quot;I did not know that he</span>
<a name="l12148"><span class="ln">12148 </span></a><span class="s0">ever had any such plan.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12149"><span class="ln">12149 </span></a>
<a name="l12150"><span class="ln">12150 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nay, I had it from you.  You wrote me word of it three months ago.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12151"><span class="ln">12151 </span></a>
<a name="l12152"><span class="ln">12152 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Me! impossible!&quot;</span>
<a name="l12153"><span class="ln">12153 </span></a>
<a name="l12154"><span class="ln">12154 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed you did.  I remember it perfectly.  You mentioned it as</span>
<a name="l12155"><span class="ln">12155 </span></a><span class="s0">what was certainly to be very soon.  Mrs. Perry had told somebody,</span>
<a name="l12156"><span class="ln">12156 </span></a><span class="s0">and was extremely happy about it.  It was owing to _her_ persuasion,</span>
<a name="l12157"><span class="ln">12157 </span></a><span class="s0">as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal</span>
<a name="l12158"><span class="ln">12158 </span></a><span class="s0">of harm.  You must remember it now?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12159"><span class="ln">12159 </span></a>
<a name="l12160"><span class="ln">12160 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12161"><span class="ln">12161 </span></a>
<a name="l12162"><span class="ln">12162 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must</span>
<a name="l12163"><span class="ln">12163 </span></a><span class="s0">have dreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith,</span>
<a name="l12164"><span class="ln">12164 </span></a><span class="s0">you walk as if you were tired.  You will not be sorry to find</span>
<a name="l12165"><span class="ln">12165 </span></a><span class="s0">yourself at home.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12166"><span class="ln">12166 </span></a>
<a name="l12167"><span class="ln">12167 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What is this?--What is this?&quot; cried Mr. Weston, &quot;about Perry</span>
<a name="l12168"><span class="ln">12168 </span></a><span class="s0">and a carriage?  Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank?</span>
<a name="l12169"><span class="ln">12169 </span></a><span class="s0">I am glad he can afford it.  You had it from himself, had you?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12170"><span class="ln">12170 </span></a>
<a name="l12171"><span class="ln">12171 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, sir,&quot; replied his son, laughing, &quot;I seem to have had it</span>
<a name="l12172"><span class="ln">12172 </span></a><span class="s0">from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's</span>
<a name="l12173"><span class="ln">12173 </span></a><span class="s0">having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago,</span>
<a name="l12174"><span class="ln">12174 </span></a><span class="s0">with all these particulars--but as she declares she never heard</span>
<a name="l12175"><span class="ln">12175 </span></a><span class="s0">a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream.  I am</span>
<a name="l12176"><span class="ln">12176 </span></a><span class="s0">a great dreamer.  I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--</span>
<a name="l12177"><span class="ln">12177 </span></a><span class="s0">and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin</span>
<a name="l12178"><span class="ln">12178 </span></a><span class="s0">dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12179"><span class="ln">12179 </span></a>
<a name="l12180"><span class="ln">12180 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is odd though,&quot; observed his father, &quot;that you should have had such</span>
<a name="l12181"><span class="ln">12181 </span></a><span class="s0">a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you</span>
<a name="l12182"><span class="ln">12182 </span></a><span class="s0">should be thinking of at Enscombe.  Perry's setting up his carriage!</span>
<a name="l12183"><span class="ln">12183 </span></a><span class="s0">and his wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--</span>
<a name="l12184"><span class="ln">12184 </span></a><span class="s0">just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other;</span>
<a name="l12185"><span class="ln">12185 </span></a><span class="s0">only a little premature.  What an air of probability sometimes</span>
<a name="l12186"><span class="ln">12186 </span></a><span class="s0">runs through a dream!  And at others, what a heap of absurdities</span>
<a name="l12187"><span class="ln">12187 </span></a><span class="s0">it is!  Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in</span>
<a name="l12188"><span class="ln">12188 </span></a><span class="s0">your thoughts when you are absent.  Emma, you are a great dreamer,</span>
<a name="l12189"><span class="ln">12189 </span></a><span class="s0">I think?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12190"><span class="ln">12190 </span></a>
<a name="l12191"><span class="ln">12191 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was out of hearing.  She had hurried on before her guests</span>
<a name="l12192"><span class="ln">12192 </span></a><span class="s0">to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach</span>
<a name="l12193"><span class="ln">12193 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Weston's hint.</span>
<a name="l12194"><span class="ln">12194 </span></a>
<a name="l12195"><span class="ln">12195 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Why, to own the truth,&quot; cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain</span>
<a name="l12196"><span class="ln">12196 </span></a><span class="s0">to be heard the last two minutes, &quot;if I must speak on this subject,</span>
<a name="l12197"><span class="ln">12197 </span></a><span class="s0">there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not</span>
<a name="l12198"><span class="ln">12198 </span></a><span class="s0">mean to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes</span>
<a name="l12199"><span class="ln">12199 </span></a><span class="s0">the oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it,</span>
<a name="l12200"><span class="ln">12200 </span></a><span class="s0">I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring;</span>
<a name="l12201"><span class="ln">12201 </span></a><span class="s0">for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles</span>
<a name="l12202"><span class="ln">12202 </span></a><span class="s0">knew of it as well as ourselves--but it was quite a secret,</span>
<a name="l12203"><span class="ln">12203 </span></a><span class="s0">known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days.</span>
<a name="l12204"><span class="ln">12204 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came</span>
<a name="l12205"><span class="ln">12205 </span></a><span class="s0">to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she</span>
<a name="l12206"><span class="ln">12206 </span></a><span class="s0">had prevailed.  Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us</span>
<a name="l12207"><span class="ln">12207 </span></a><span class="s0">of it when we got home?  I forget where we had been walking to--</span>
<a name="l12208"><span class="ln">12208 </span></a><span class="s0">very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls.</span>
<a name="l12209"><span class="ln">12209 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed I do</span>
<a name="l12210"><span class="ln">12210 </span></a><span class="s0">not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;</span>
<a name="l12211"><span class="ln">12211 </span></a><span class="s0">she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not</span>
<a name="l12212"><span class="ln">12212 </span></a><span class="s0">to go beyond:  and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it</span>
<a name="l12213"><span class="ln">12213 </span></a><span class="s0">to a soul that I know of.  At the same time, I will not positively</span>
<a name="l12214"><span class="ln">12214 </span></a><span class="s0">answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do</span>
<a name="l12215"><span class="ln">12215 </span></a><span class="s0">sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware.  I am a talker,</span>
<a name="l12216"><span class="ln">12216 </span></a><span class="s0">you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing</span>
<a name="l12217"><span class="ln">12217 </span></a><span class="s0">escape me which I should not.  I am not like Jane; I wish I were.</span>
<a name="l12218"><span class="ln">12218 </span></a><span class="s0">I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world.</span>
<a name="l12219"><span class="ln">12219 </span></a><span class="s0">Where is she?--Oh! just behind.  Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming.--</span>
<a name="l12220"><span class="ln">12220 </span></a><span class="s0">Extraordinary dream, indeed!&quot;</span>
<a name="l12221"><span class="ln">12221 </span></a>
<a name="l12222"><span class="ln">12222 </span></a><span class="s0">They were entering the hall.  Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded</span>
<a name="l12223"><span class="ln">12223 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane.  From Frank Churchill's face,</span>
<a name="l12224"><span class="ln">12224 </span></a><span class="s0">where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away,</span>
<a name="l12225"><span class="ln">12225 </span></a><span class="s0">he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind,</span>
<a name="l12226"><span class="ln">12226 </span></a><span class="s0">and too busy with her shawl.  Mr. Weston had walked in.  The two</span>
<a name="l12227"><span class="ln">12227 </span></a><span class="s0">other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass.  Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l12228"><span class="ln">12228 </span></a><span class="s0">suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye--</span>
<a name="l12229"><span class="ln">12229 </span></a><span class="s0">he seemed watching her intently--in vain, however, if it were so--</span>
<a name="l12230"><span class="ln">12230 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.</span>
<a name="l12231"><span class="ln">12231 </span></a>
<a name="l12232"><span class="ln">12232 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no time for farther remark or explanation.  The dream must</span>
<a name="l12233"><span class="ln">12233 </span></a><span class="s0">be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round</span>
<a name="l12234"><span class="ln">12234 </span></a><span class="s0">the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l12235"><span class="ln">12235 </span></a><span class="s0">and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and</span>
<a name="l12236"><span class="ln">12236 </span></a><span class="s0">persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke,</span>
<a name="l12237"><span class="ln">12237 </span></a><span class="s0">on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded.</span>
<a name="l12238"><span class="ln">12238 </span></a><span class="s0">Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.</span>
<a name="l12239"><span class="ln">12239 </span></a>
<a name="l12240"><span class="ln">12240 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Miss Woodhouse,&quot; said Frank Churchill, after examining a table</span>
<a name="l12241"><span class="ln">12241 </span></a><span class="s0">behind him, which he could reach as he sat, &quot;have your nephews taken</span>
<a name="l12242"><span class="ln">12242 </span></a><span class="s0">away their alphabets--their box of letters?  It used to stand here.</span>
<a name="l12243"><span class="ln">12243 </span></a><span class="s0">Where is it?  This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought</span>
<a name="l12244"><span class="ln">12244 </span></a><span class="s0">to be treated rather as winter than summer.  We had great amusement</span>
<a name="l12245"><span class="ln">12245 </span></a><span class="s0">with those letters one morning.  I want to puzzle you again.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12246"><span class="ln">12246 </span></a>
<a name="l12247"><span class="ln">12247 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table</span>
<a name="l12248"><span class="ln">12248 </span></a><span class="s0">was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much</span>
<a name="l12249"><span class="ln">12249 </span></a><span class="s0">disposed to employ as their two selves.  They were rapidly forming</span>
<a name="l12250"><span class="ln">12250 </span></a><span class="s0">words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.</span>
<a name="l12251"><span class="ln">12251 </span></a><span class="s0">The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for</span>
<a name="l12252"><span class="ln">12252 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort,</span>
<a name="l12253"><span class="ln">12253 </span></a><span class="s0">which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily</span>
<a name="l12254"><span class="ln">12254 </span></a><span class="s0">occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure</span>
<a name="l12255"><span class="ln">12255 </span></a><span class="s0">of the &quot;poor little boys,&quot; or in fondly pointing out, as he took</span>
<a name="l12256"><span class="ln">12256 </span></a><span class="s0">up any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.</span>
<a name="l12257"><span class="ln">12257 </span></a>
<a name="l12258"><span class="ln">12258 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax.  She gave</span>
<a name="l12259"><span class="ln">12259 </span></a><span class="s0">a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it.</span>
<a name="l12260"><span class="ln">12260 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l12261"><span class="ln">12261 </span></a><span class="s0">so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much</span>
<a name="l12262"><span class="ln">12262 </span></a><span class="s0">as he could, with as little apparent observation.  The word</span>
<a name="l12263"><span class="ln">12263 </span></a><span class="s0">was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away.  If meant</span>
<a name="l12264"><span class="ln">12264 </span></a><span class="s0">to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight,</span>
<a name="l12265"><span class="ln">12265 </span></a><span class="s0">she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across,</span>
<a name="l12266"><span class="ln">12266 </span></a><span class="s0">for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word,</span>
<a name="l12267"><span class="ln">12267 </span></a><span class="s0">and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work.</span>
<a name="l12268"><span class="ln">12268 </span></a><span class="s0">She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.</span>
<a name="l12269"><span class="ln">12269 </span></a><span class="s0">The word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,</span>
<a name="l12270"><span class="ln">12270 </span></a><span class="s0">there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not</span>
<a name="l12271"><span class="ln">12271 </span></a><span class="s0">otherwise ostensible.  Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream;</span>
<a name="l12272"><span class="ln">12272 </span></a><span class="s0">but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension.</span>
<a name="l12273"><span class="ln">12273 </span></a><span class="s0">How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been</span>
<a name="l12274"><span class="ln">12274 </span></a><span class="s0">so lain asleep!  He feared there must be some decided involvement.</span>
<a name="l12275"><span class="ln">12275 </span></a><span class="s0">Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn.</span>
<a name="l12276"><span class="ln">12276 </span></a><span class="s0">These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick.</span>
<a name="l12277"><span class="ln">12277 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank</span>
<a name="l12278"><span class="ln">12278 </span></a><span class="s0">Churchill's part.</span>
<a name="l12279"><span class="ln">12279 </span></a>
<a name="l12280"><span class="ln">12280 </span></a><span class="s0">With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great</span>
<a name="l12281"><span class="ln">12281 </span></a><span class="s0">alarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions.</span>
<a name="l12282"><span class="ln">12282 </span></a><span class="s0">He saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look</span>
<a name="l12283"><span class="ln">12283 </span></a><span class="s0">sly and demure.  He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found</span>
<a name="l12284"><span class="ln">12284 </span></a><span class="s0">it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it</span>
<a name="l12285"><span class="ln">12285 </span></a><span class="s0">proper to appear to censure; for she said, &quot;Nonsense! for shame!&quot;</span>
<a name="l12286"><span class="ln">12286 </span></a><span class="s0">He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane,</span>
<a name="l12287"><span class="ln">12287 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I will give it to her--shall I?&quot;--and as clearly heard Emma</span>
<a name="l12288"><span class="ln">12288 </span></a><span class="s0">opposing it with eager laughing warmth.  &quot;No, no, you must not;</span>
<a name="l12289"><span class="ln">12289 </span></a><span class="s0">you shall not, indeed.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12290"><span class="ln">12290 </span></a>
<a name="l12291"><span class="ln">12291 </span></a><span class="s0">It was done however.  This gallant young man, who seemed to love</span>
<a name="l12292"><span class="ln">12292 </span></a><span class="s0">without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,</span>
<a name="l12293"><span class="ln">12293 </span></a><span class="s0">directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular</span>
<a name="l12294"><span class="ln">12294 </span></a><span class="s0">degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.  Mr. Knightley's</span>
<a name="l12295"><span class="ln">12295 </span></a><span class="s0">excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize</span>
<a name="l12296"><span class="ln">12296 </span></a><span class="s0">every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was</span>
<a name="l12297"><span class="ln">12297 </span></a><span class="s0">not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_.  Jane Fairfax's perception</span>
<a name="l12298"><span class="ln">12298 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal</span>
<a name="l12299"><span class="ln">12299 </span></a><span class="s0">to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters</span>
<a name="l12300"><span class="ln">12300 </span></a><span class="s0">so arranged.  She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing</span>
<a name="l12301"><span class="ln">12301 </span></a><span class="s0">herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her,</span>
<a name="l12302"><span class="ln">12302 </span></a><span class="s0">and saying only, &quot;I did not know that proper names were allowed,&quot;</span>
<a name="l12303"><span class="ln">12303 </span></a><span class="s0">pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked</span>
<a name="l12304"><span class="ln">12304 </span></a><span class="s0">resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered.</span>
<a name="l12305"><span class="ln">12305 </span></a><span class="s0">Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned</span>
<a name="l12306"><span class="ln">12306 </span></a><span class="s0">towards her aunt.</span>
<a name="l12307"><span class="ln">12307 </span></a>
<a name="l12308"><span class="ln">12308 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Aye, very true, my dear,&quot; cried the latter, though Jane had not</span>
<a name="l12309"><span class="ln">12309 </span></a><span class="s0">spoken a word--&quot;I was just going to say the same thing.  It is time</span>
<a name="l12310"><span class="ln">12310 </span></a><span class="s0">for us to be going indeed.  The evening is closing in, and grandmama</span>
<a name="l12311"><span class="ln">12311 </span></a><span class="s0">will be looking for us.  My dear sir, you are too obliging.</span>
<a name="l12312"><span class="ln">12312 </span></a><span class="s0">We really must wish you good night.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12313"><span class="ln">12313 </span></a>
<a name="l12314"><span class="ln">12314 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt</span>
<a name="l12315"><span class="ln">12315 </span></a><span class="s0">had preconceived.  She was immediately up, and wanting to quit</span>
<a name="l12316"><span class="ln">12316 </span></a><span class="s0">the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away;</span>
<a name="l12317"><span class="ln">12317 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously</span>
<a name="l12318"><span class="ln">12318 </span></a><span class="s0">pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined.</span>
<a name="l12319"><span class="ln">12319 </span></a><span class="s0">She was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was</span>
<a name="l12320"><span class="ln">12320 </span></a><span class="s0">looking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion;</span>
<a name="l12321"><span class="ln">12321 </span></a><span class="s0">and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.</span>
<a name="l12322"><span class="ln">12322 </span></a>
<a name="l12323"><span class="ln">12323 </span></a><span class="s0">He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full</span>
<a name="l12324"><span class="ln">12324 </span></a><span class="s0">of what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist</span>
<a name="l12325"><span class="ln">12325 </span></a><span class="s0">his observations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--</span>
<a name="l12326"><span class="ln">12326 </span></a><span class="s0">an anxious friend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question.</span>
<a name="l12327"><span class="ln">12327 </span></a><span class="s0">He could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to</span>
<a name="l12328"><span class="ln">12328 </span></a><span class="s0">preserve her.  It was his duty.</span>
<a name="l12329"><span class="ln">12329 </span></a>
<a name="l12330"><span class="ln">12330 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Pray, Emma,&quot; said he, &quot;may I ask in what lay the great amusement,</span>
<a name="l12331"><span class="ln">12331 </span></a><span class="s0">the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax?</span>
<a name="l12332"><span class="ln">12332 </span></a><span class="s0">I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very</span>
<a name="l12333"><span class="ln">12333 </span></a><span class="s0">entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12334"><span class="ln">12334 </span></a>
<a name="l12335"><span class="ln">12335 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was extremely confused.  She could not endure to give him the</span>
<a name="l12336"><span class="ln">12336 </span></a><span class="s0">true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed,</span>
<a name="l12337"><span class="ln">12337 </span></a><span class="s0">she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.</span>
<a name="l12338"><span class="ln">12338 </span></a>
<a name="l12339"><span class="ln">12339 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried in evident embarrassment, &quot;it all meant nothing;</span>
<a name="l12340"><span class="ln">12340 </span></a><span class="s0">a mere joke among ourselves.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12341"><span class="ln">12341 </span></a>
<a name="l12342"><span class="ln">12342 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The joke,&quot; he replied gravely, &quot;seemed confined to you</span>
<a name="l12343"><span class="ln">12343 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Churchill.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12344"><span class="ln">12344 </span></a>
<a name="l12345"><span class="ln">12345 </span></a><span class="s0">He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not.  She would</span>
<a name="l12346"><span class="ln">12346 </span></a><span class="s0">rather busy herself about any thing than speak.  He sat a little</span>
<a name="l12347"><span class="ln">12347 </span></a><span class="s0">while in doubt.  A variety of evils crossed his mind.  Interference--</span>
<a name="l12348"><span class="ln">12348 </span></a><span class="s0">fruitless interference.  Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy,</span>
<a name="l12349"><span class="ln">12349 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed to declare her affection engaged.  Yet he would speak.</span>
<a name="l12350"><span class="ln">12350 </span></a><span class="s0">He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in</span>
<a name="l12351"><span class="ln">12351 </span></a><span class="s0">an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter</span>
<a name="l12352"><span class="ln">12352 </span></a><span class="s0">any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.</span>
<a name="l12353"><span class="ln">12353 </span></a>
<a name="l12354"><span class="ln">12354 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Emma,&quot; said he at last, with earnest kindness, &quot;do you</span>
<a name="l12355"><span class="ln">12355 </span></a><span class="s0">think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between</span>
<a name="l12356"><span class="ln">12356 </span></a><span class="s0">the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12357"><span class="ln">12357 </span></a>
<a name="l12358"><span class="ln">12358 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?  Oh! yes, perfectly.--</span>
<a name="l12359"><span class="ln">12359 </span></a><span class="s0">Why do you make a doubt of it?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12360"><span class="ln">12360 </span></a>
<a name="l12361"><span class="ln">12361 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her,</span>
<a name="l12362"><span class="ln">12362 </span></a><span class="s0">or that she admired him?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12363"><span class="ln">12363 </span></a>
<a name="l12364"><span class="ln">12364 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Never, never!&quot; she cried with a most open eagerness--&quot;Never, for</span>
<a name="l12365"><span class="ln">12365 </span></a><span class="s0">the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me.</span>
<a name="l12366"><span class="ln">12366 </span></a><span class="s0">And how could it possibly come into your head?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12367"><span class="ln">12367 </span></a>
<a name="l12368"><span class="ln">12368 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--</span>
<a name="l12369"><span class="ln">12369 </span></a><span class="s0">certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12370"><span class="ln">12370 </span></a>
<a name="l12371"><span class="ln">12371 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! you amuse me excessively.  I am delighted to find that you</span>
<a name="l12372"><span class="ln">12372 </span></a><span class="s0">can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--</span>
<a name="l12373"><span class="ln">12373 </span></a><span class="s0">very sorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will</span>
<a name="l12374"><span class="ln">12374 </span></a><span class="s0">not do.  There is no admiration between them, I do assure you;</span>
<a name="l12375"><span class="ln">12375 </span></a><span class="s0">and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some</span>
<a name="l12376"><span class="ln">12376 </span></a><span class="s0">peculiar circumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature--</span>
<a name="l12377"><span class="ln">12377 </span></a><span class="s0">it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of</span>
<a name="l12378"><span class="ln">12378 </span></a><span class="s0">nonsense in it--but the part which is capable of being communicated,</span>
<a name="l12379"><span class="ln">12379 </span></a><span class="s0">which is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or</span>
<a name="l12380"><span class="ln">12380 </span></a><span class="s0">admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be.</span>
<a name="l12381"><span class="ln">12381 </span></a><span class="s0">That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I can _answer_ for its</span>
<a name="l12382"><span class="ln">12382 </span></a><span class="s0">being so on his.  I will answer for the gentleman's indifference.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12383"><span class="ln">12383 </span></a>
<a name="l12384"><span class="ln">12384 </span></a><span class="s0">She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction</span>
<a name="l12385"><span class="ln">12385 </span></a><span class="s0">which silenced, Mr. Knightley.  She was in gay spirits, and would</span>
<a name="l12386"><span class="ln">12386 </span></a><span class="s0">have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars</span>
<a name="l12387"><span class="ln">12387 </span></a><span class="s0">of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows</span>
<a name="l12388"><span class="ln">12388 </span></a><span class="s0">of a circumstance which highly entertained her:  but his gaiety did</span>
<a name="l12389"><span class="ln">12389 </span></a><span class="s0">not meet hers.  He found he could not be useful, and his feelings</span>
<a name="l12390"><span class="ln">12390 </span></a><span class="s0">were too much irritated for talking.  That he might not be irritated</span>
<a name="l12391"><span class="ln">12391 </span></a><span class="s0">into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender</span>
<a name="l12392"><span class="ln">12392 </span></a><span class="s0">habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon</span>
<a name="l12393"><span class="ln">12393 </span></a><span class="s0">afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness</span>
<a name="l12394"><span class="ln">12394 </span></a><span class="s0">and solitude of Donwell Abbey.</span>

<a name="l12400"><span class="ln">12400 </span></a>
<a name="l12401"><span class="ln">12401 </span></a><span class="s0">After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and</span>
<a name="l12402"><span class="ln">12402 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification</span>
<a name="l12403"><span class="ln">12403 </span></a><span class="s0">of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn.</span>
<a name="l12404"><span class="ln">12404 </span></a><span class="s0">No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores</span>
<a name="l12405"><span class="ln">12405 </span></a><span class="s0">at present.  In the daily interchange of news, they must be again</span>
<a name="l12406"><span class="ln">12406 </span></a><span class="s0">restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings'</span>
<a name="l12407"><span class="ln">12407 </span></a><span class="s0">coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,</span>
<a name="l12408"><span class="ln">12408 </span></a><span class="s0">whose health seemed every day to supply a different report,</span>
<a name="l12409"><span class="ln">12409 </span></a><span class="s0">and the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped</span>
<a name="l12410"><span class="ln">12410 </span></a><span class="s0">might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child,</span>
<a name="l12411"><span class="ln">12411 </span></a><span class="s0">as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.</span>
<a name="l12412"><span class="ln">12412 </span></a>
<a name="l12413"><span class="ln">12413 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed.  It was the delay of a great</span>
<a name="l12414"><span class="ln">12414 </span></a><span class="s0">deal of pleasure and parade.  Her introductions and recommendations</span>
<a name="l12415"><span class="ln">12415 </span></a><span class="s0">must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of.</span>
<a name="l12416"><span class="ln">12416 </span></a><span class="s0">So she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced</span>
<a name="l12417"><span class="ln">12417 </span></a><span class="s0">her that every thing need not be put off.  Why should not they</span>
<a name="l12418"><span class="ln">12418 </span></a><span class="s0">explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?  They could</span>
<a name="l12419"><span class="ln">12419 </span></a><span class="s0">go there again with them in the autumn.  It was settled that they</span>
<a name="l12420"><span class="ln">12420 </span></a><span class="s0">should go to Box Hill.  That there was to be such a party had been</span>
<a name="l12421"><span class="ln">12421 </span></a><span class="s0">long generally known:  it had even given the idea of another.</span>
<a name="l12422"><span class="ln">12422 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body</span>
<a name="l12423"><span class="ln">12423 </span></a><span class="s0">found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed</span>
<a name="l12424"><span class="ln">12424 </span></a><span class="s0">to chuse some fine morning and drive thither.  Two or three more</span>
<a name="l12425"><span class="ln">12425 </span></a><span class="s0">of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to</span>
<a name="l12426"><span class="ln">12426 </span></a><span class="s0">be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior</span>
<a name="l12427"><span class="ln">12427 </span></a><span class="s0">to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking,</span>
<a name="l12428"><span class="ln">12428 </span></a><span class="s0">and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.</span>
<a name="l12429"><span class="ln">12429 </span></a>
<a name="l12430"><span class="ln">12430 </span></a><span class="s0">This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could</span>
<a name="l12431"><span class="ln">12431 </span></a><span class="s0">not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing</span>
<a name="l12432"><span class="ln">12432 </span></a><span class="s0">from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her</span>
<a name="l12433"><span class="ln">12433 </span></a><span class="s0">brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite,</span>
<a name="l12434"><span class="ln">12434 </span></a><span class="s0">and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded</span>
<a name="l12435"><span class="ln">12435 </span></a><span class="s0">to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection.  Now, as her</span>
<a name="l12436"><span class="ln">12436 </span></a><span class="s0">objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton,</span>
<a name="l12437"><span class="ln">12437 </span></a><span class="s0">of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth</span>
<a name="l12438"><span class="ln">12438 </span></a><span class="s0">bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof</span>
<a name="l12439"><span class="ln">12439 </span></a><span class="s0">to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found</span>
<a name="l12440"><span class="ln">12440 </span></a><span class="s0">herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she</span>
<a name="l12441"><span class="ln">12441 </span></a><span class="s0">would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would</span>
<a name="l12442"><span class="ln">12442 </span></a><span class="s0">probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of</span>
<a name="l12443"><span class="ln">12443 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton's party!  Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance</span>
<a name="l12444"><span class="ln">12444 </span></a><span class="s0">of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity</span>
<a name="l12445"><span class="ln">12445 </span></a><span class="s0">in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.</span>
<a name="l12446"><span class="ln">12446 </span></a>
<a name="l12447"><span class="ln">12447 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am glad you approve of what I have done,&quot; said he very comfortably.</span>
<a name="l12448"><span class="ln">12448 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But I thought you would.  Such schemes as these are nothing</span>
<a name="l12449"><span class="ln">12449 </span></a><span class="s0">without numbers.  One cannot have too large a party.  A large party</span>
<a name="l12450"><span class="ln">12450 </span></a><span class="s0">secures its own amusement.  And she is a good-natured woman after all.</span>
<a name="l12451"><span class="ln">12451 </span></a><span class="s0">One could not leave her out.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12452"><span class="ln">12452 </span></a>
<a name="l12453"><span class="ln">12453 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.</span>
<a name="l12454"><span class="ln">12454 </span></a>
<a name="l12455"><span class="ln">12455 </span></a><span class="s0">It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton</span>
<a name="l12456"><span class="ln">12456 </span></a><span class="s0">was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston</span>
<a name="l12457"><span class="ln">12457 </span></a><span class="s0">as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw</span>
<a name="l12458"><span class="ln">12458 </span></a><span class="s0">every thing into sad uncertainty.  It might be weeks, it might be</span>
<a name="l12459"><span class="ln">12459 </span></a><span class="s0">only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations</span>
<a name="l12460"><span class="ln">12460 </span></a><span class="s0">could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation.</span>
<a name="l12461"><span class="ln">12461 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack.</span>
<a name="l12462"><span class="ln">12462 </span></a>
<a name="l12463"><span class="ln">12463 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Is not this most vexations, Knightley?&quot; she cried.--&quot;And such weather</span>
<a name="l12464"><span class="ln">12464 </span></a><span class="s0">for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious.</span>
<a name="l12465"><span class="ln">12465 </span></a><span class="s0">What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate,</span>
<a name="l12466"><span class="ln">12466 </span></a><span class="s0">and nothing done.  Before this time last year I assure you we had</span>
<a name="l12467"><span class="ln">12467 </span></a><span class="s0">had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12468"><span class="ln">12468 </span></a>
<a name="l12469"><span class="ln">12469 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You had better explore to Donwell,&quot; replied Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l12470"><span class="ln">12470 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That may be done without horses.  Come, and eat my strawberries.</span>
<a name="l12471"><span class="ln">12471 </span></a><span class="s0">They are ripening fast.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12472"><span class="ln">12472 </span></a>
<a name="l12473"><span class="ln">12473 </span></a><span class="s0">If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,</span>
<a name="l12474"><span class="ln">12474 </span></a><span class="s0">for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the &quot;Oh!  I should</span>
<a name="l12475"><span class="ln">12475 </span></a><span class="s0">like it of all things,&quot; was not plainer in words than manner.</span>
<a name="l12476"><span class="ln">12476 </span></a><span class="s0">Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for</span>
<a name="l12477"><span class="ln">12477 </span></a><span class="s0">the invitation:  but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have</span>
<a name="l12478"><span class="ln">12478 </span></a><span class="s0">been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere.</span>
<a name="l12479"><span class="ln">12479 </span></a><span class="s0">She promised him again and again to come--much oftener than</span>
<a name="l12480"><span class="ln">12480 </span></a><span class="s0">he doubted--and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy,</span>
<a name="l12481"><span class="ln">12481 </span></a><span class="s0">such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.</span>
<a name="l12482"><span class="ln">12482 </span></a>
<a name="l12483"><span class="ln">12483 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You may depend upon me,&quot; said she.  &quot;I certainly will come.</span>
<a name="l12484"><span class="ln">12484 </span></a><span class="s0">Name your day, and I will come.  You will allow me to bring</span>
<a name="l12485"><span class="ln">12485 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane Fairfax?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12486"><span class="ln">12486 </span></a>
<a name="l12487"><span class="ln">12487 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I cannot name a day,&quot; said he, &quot;till I have spoken to some others</span>
<a name="l12488"><span class="ln">12488 </span></a><span class="s0">whom I would wish to meet you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12489"><span class="ln">12489 </span></a>
<a name="l12490"><span class="ln">12490 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! leave all that to me.  Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am</span>
<a name="l12491"><span class="ln">12491 </span></a><span class="s0">Lady Patroness, you know.  It is my party.  I will bring friends</span>
<a name="l12492"><span class="ln">12492 </span></a><span class="s0">with me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12493"><span class="ln">12493 </span></a>
<a name="l12494"><span class="ln">12494 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope you will bring Elton,&quot; said he:  &quot;but I will not trouble</span>
<a name="l12495"><span class="ln">12495 </span></a><span class="s0">you to give any other invitations.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12496"><span class="ln">12496 </span></a>
<a name="l12497"><span class="ln">12497 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! now you are looking very sly.  But consider--you need not be afraid</span>
<a name="l12498"><span class="ln">12498 </span></a><span class="s0">of delegating power to _me_.  I am no young lady on her preferment.</span>
<a name="l12499"><span class="ln">12499 </span></a><span class="s0">Married women, you know, may be safely authorised.  It is my party.</span>
<a name="l12500"><span class="ln">12500 </span></a><span class="s0">Leave it all to me.  I will invite your guests.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12501"><span class="ln">12501 </span></a>
<a name="l12502"><span class="ln">12502 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot;--he calmly replied,--&quot;there is but one married woman in the world</span>
<a name="l12503"><span class="ln">12503 </span></a><span class="s0">whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell,</span>
<a name="l12504"><span class="ln">12504 </span></a><span class="s0">and that one is--&quot;</span>
<a name="l12505"><span class="ln">12505 </span></a>
<a name="l12506"><span class="ln">12506 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,&quot; interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.</span>
<a name="l12507"><span class="ln">12507 </span></a>
<a name="l12508"><span class="ln">12508 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage</span>
<a name="l12509"><span class="ln">12509 </span></a><span class="s0">such matters myself.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12510"><span class="ln">12510 </span></a>
<a name="l12511"><span class="ln">12511 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! you are an odd creature!&quot; she cried, satisfied to have no</span>
<a name="l12512"><span class="ln">12512 </span></a><span class="s0">one preferred to herself.--&quot;You are a humourist, and may say what</span>
<a name="l12513"><span class="ln">12513 </span></a><span class="s0">you like.  Quite a humourist.  Well, I shall bring Jane with me--</span>
<a name="l12514"><span class="ln">12514 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you.  I have no objections</span>
<a name="l12515"><span class="ln">12515 </span></a><span class="s0">at all to meeting the Hartfield family.  Don't scruple.  I know</span>
<a name="l12516"><span class="ln">12516 </span></a><span class="s0">you are attached to them.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12517"><span class="ln">12517 </span></a>
<a name="l12518"><span class="ln">12518 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call</span>
<a name="l12519"><span class="ln">12519 </span></a><span class="s0">on Miss Bates in my way home.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12520"><span class="ln">12520 </span></a>
<a name="l12521"><span class="ln">12521 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like.</span>
<a name="l12522"><span class="ln">12522 </span></a><span class="s0">It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing.</span>
<a name="l12523"><span class="ln">12523 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets</span>
<a name="l12524"><span class="ln">12524 </span></a><span class="s0">hanging on my arm.  Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon.</span>
<a name="l12525"><span class="ln">12525 </span></a><span class="s0">Nothing can be more simple, you see.  And Jane will have such another.</span>
<a name="l12526"><span class="ln">12526 </span></a><span class="s0">There is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.  We are</span>
<a name="l12527"><span class="ln">12527 </span></a><span class="s0">to walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves,</span>
<a name="l12528"><span class="ln">12528 </span></a><span class="s0">and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide,</span>
<a name="l12529"><span class="ln">12529 </span></a><span class="s0">it is to be all out of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know.</span>
<a name="l12530"><span class="ln">12530 </span></a><span class="s0">Every thing as natural and simple as possible.  Is not that your idea?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12531"><span class="ln">12531 </span></a>
<a name="l12532"><span class="ln">12532 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not quite.  My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have</span>
<a name="l12533"><span class="ln">12533 </span></a><span class="s0">the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity</span>
<a name="l12534"><span class="ln">12534 </span></a><span class="s0">of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think</span>
<a name="l12535"><span class="ln">12535 </span></a><span class="s0">is best observed by meals within doors.  When you are tired of eating</span>
<a name="l12536"><span class="ln">12536 </span></a><span class="s0">strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12537"><span class="ln">12537 </span></a>
<a name="l12538"><span class="ln">12538 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out.  And, by the bye,</span>
<a name="l12539"><span class="ln">12539 </span></a><span class="s0">can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--</span>
<a name="l12540"><span class="ln">12540 </span></a><span class="s0">Pray be sincere, Knightley.  If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges,</span>
<a name="l12541"><span class="ln">12541 </span></a><span class="s0">or to inspect anything--&quot;</span>
<a name="l12542"><span class="ln">12542 </span></a>
<a name="l12543"><span class="ln">12543 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12544"><span class="ln">12544 </span></a>
<a name="l12545"><span class="ln">12545 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper</span>
<a name="l12546"><span class="ln">12546 </span></a><span class="s0">is extremely clever.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12547"><span class="ln">12547 </span></a>
<a name="l12548"><span class="ln">12548 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever,</span>
<a name="l12549"><span class="ln">12549 </span></a><span class="s0">and would spurn any body's assistance.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12550"><span class="ln">12550 </span></a>
<a name="l12551"><span class="ln">12551 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I wish we had a donkey.  The thing would be for us all to come</span>
<a name="l12552"><span class="ln">12552 </span></a><span class="s0">on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by.</span>
<a name="l12553"><span class="ln">12553 </span></a><span class="s0">I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey.  In a country</span>
<a name="l12554"><span class="ln">12554 </span></a><span class="s0">life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have</span>
<a name="l12555"><span class="ln">12555 </span></a><span class="s0">ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut</span>
<a name="l12556"><span class="ln">12556 </span></a><span class="s0">up at home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust,</span>
<a name="l12557"><span class="ln">12557 </span></a><span class="s0">and in winter there is dirt.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12558"><span class="ln">12558 </span></a>
<a name="l12559"><span class="ln">12559 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury.</span>
<a name="l12560"><span class="ln">12560 </span></a><span class="s0">Donwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry.  Come on</span>
<a name="l12561"><span class="ln">12561 </span></a><span class="s0">a donkey, however, if you prefer it.  You can borrow Mrs. Cole's.</span>
<a name="l12562"><span class="ln">12562 </span></a><span class="s0">I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12563"><span class="ln">12563 </span></a>
<a name="l12564"><span class="ln">12564 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That I am sure you would.  Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.</span>
<a name="l12565"><span class="ln">12565 </span></a><span class="s0">Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the</span>
<a name="l12566"><span class="ln">12566 </span></a><span class="s0">warmest heart.  As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--</span>
<a name="l12567"><span class="ln">12567 </span></a><span class="s0">Yes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention</span>
<a name="l12568"><span class="ln">12568 </span></a><span class="s0">to me in the whole of this scheme.  You have hit upon the very thing</span>
<a name="l12569"><span class="ln">12569 </span></a><span class="s0">to please me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12570"><span class="ln">12570 </span></a>
<a name="l12571"><span class="ln">12571 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.</span>
<a name="l12572"><span class="ln">12572 </span></a><span class="s0">He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;</span>
<a name="l12573"><span class="ln">12573 </span></a><span class="s0">and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors</span>
<a name="l12574"><span class="ln">12574 </span></a><span class="s0">to eat would inevitably make him ill.  Mr. Woodhouse must not,</span>
<a name="l12575"><span class="ln">12575 </span></a><span class="s0">under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two</span>
<a name="l12576"><span class="ln">12576 </span></a><span class="s0">spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.</span>
<a name="l12577"><span class="ln">12577 </span></a>
<a name="l12578"><span class="ln">12578 </span></a><span class="s0">He was invited on good faith.  No lurking horrors were to upbraid</span>
<a name="l12579"><span class="ln">12579 </span></a><span class="s0">him for his easy credulity.  He did consent.  He had not been</span>
<a name="l12580"><span class="ln">12580 </span></a><span class="s0">at Donwell for two years.  &quot;Some very fine morning, he, and Emma,</span>
<a name="l12581"><span class="ln">12581 </span></a><span class="s0">and Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with</span>
<a name="l12582"><span class="ln">12582 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens.</span>
<a name="l12583"><span class="ln">12583 </span></a><span class="s0">He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of</span>
<a name="l12584"><span class="ln">12584 </span></a><span class="s0">the day.  He should like to see the old house again exceedingly,</span>
<a name="l12585"><span class="ln">12585 </span></a><span class="s0">and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other</span>
<a name="l12586"><span class="ln">12586 </span></a><span class="s0">of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his,</span>
<a name="l12587"><span class="ln">12587 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning.</span>
<a name="l12588"><span class="ln">12588 </span></a><span class="s0">He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--</span>
<a name="l12589"><span class="ln">12589 </span></a><span class="s0">very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not</span>
<a name="l12590"><span class="ln">12590 </span></a><span class="s0">fond of dining out.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12591"><span class="ln">12591 </span></a>
<a name="l12592"><span class="ln">12592 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence.</span>
<a name="l12593"><span class="ln">12593 </span></a><span class="s0">The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if,</span>
<a name="l12594"><span class="ln">12594 </span></a><span class="s0">like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular</span>
<a name="l12595"><span class="ln">12595 </span></a><span class="s0">compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high</span>
<a name="l12596"><span class="ln">12596 </span></a><span class="s0">expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked,</span>
<a name="l12597"><span class="ln">12597 </span></a><span class="s0">promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof</span>
<a name="l12598"><span class="ln">12598 </span></a><span class="s0">of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--</span>
<a name="l12599"><span class="ln">12599 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad</span>
<a name="l12600"><span class="ln">12600 </span></a><span class="s0">to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing,</span>
<a name="l12601"><span class="ln">12601 </span></a><span class="s0">and spare no arguments to induce him to come.</span>
<a name="l12602"><span class="ln">12602 </span></a>
<a name="l12603"><span class="ln">12603 </span></a><span class="s0">In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party</span>
<a name="l12604"><span class="ln">12604 </span></a><span class="s0">to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell</span>
<a name="l12605"><span class="ln">12605 </span></a><span class="s0">was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather</span>
<a name="l12606"><span class="ln">12606 </span></a><span class="s0">appearing exactly right.</span>
<a name="l12607"><span class="ln">12607 </span></a>
<a name="l12608"><span class="ln">12608 </span></a><span class="s0">Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l12609"><span class="ln">12609 </span></a><span class="s0">was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down,</span>
<a name="l12610"><span class="ln">12610 </span></a><span class="s0">to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most</span>
<a name="l12611"><span class="ln">12611 </span></a><span class="s0">comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a</span>
<a name="l12612"><span class="ln">12612 </span></a><span class="s0">fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease,</span>
<a name="l12613"><span class="ln">12613 </span></a><span class="s0">ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise</span>
<a name="l12614"><span class="ln">12614 </span></a><span class="s0">every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.--</span>
<a name="l12615"><span class="ln">12615 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired,</span>
<a name="l12616"><span class="ln">12616 </span></a><span class="s0">and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others</span>
<a name="l12617"><span class="ln">12617 </span></a><span class="s0">were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.</span>
<a name="l12618"><span class="ln">12618 </span></a>
<a name="l12619"><span class="ln">12619 </span></a><span class="s0">It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she</span>
<a name="l12620"><span class="ln">12620 </span></a><span class="s0">was satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him,</span>
<a name="l12621"><span class="ln">12621 </span></a><span class="s0">and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with</span>
<a name="l12622"><span class="ln">12622 </span></a><span class="s0">more particular observation, more exact understanding of a house</span>
<a name="l12623"><span class="ln">12623 </span></a><span class="s0">and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.</span>
<a name="l12624"><span class="ln">12624 </span></a>
<a name="l12625"><span class="ln">12625 </span></a><span class="s0">She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance</span>
<a name="l12626"><span class="ln">12626 </span></a><span class="s0">with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant,</span>
<a name="l12627"><span class="ln">12627 </span></a><span class="s0">as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building,</span>
<a name="l12628"><span class="ln">12628 </span></a><span class="s0">its suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered--</span>
<a name="l12629"><span class="ln">12629 </span></a><span class="s0">its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream,</span>
<a name="l12630"><span class="ln">12630 </span></a><span class="s0">of which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect,</span>
<a name="l12631"><span class="ln">12631 </span></a><span class="s0">had scarcely a sight--and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues,</span>
<a name="l12632"><span class="ln">12632 </span></a><span class="s0">which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house</span>
<a name="l12633"><span class="ln">12633 </span></a><span class="s0">was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good</span>
<a name="l12634"><span class="ln">12634 </span></a><span class="s0">deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable,</span>
<a name="l12635"><span class="ln">12635 </span></a><span class="s0">and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be,</span>
<a name="l12636"><span class="ln">12636 </span></a><span class="s0">and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect</span>
<a name="l12637"><span class="ln">12637 </span></a><span class="s0">for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility,</span>
<a name="l12638"><span class="ln">12638 </span></a><span class="s0">untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John</span>
<a name="l12639"><span class="ln">12639 </span></a><span class="s0">Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.</span>
<a name="l12640"><span class="ln">12640 </span></a><span class="s0">She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could</span>
<a name="l12641"><span class="ln">12641 </span></a><span class="s0">raise a blush.  These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about</span>
<a name="l12642"><span class="ln">12642 </span></a><span class="s0">and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did,</span>
<a name="l12643"><span class="ln">12643 </span></a><span class="s0">and collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled,</span>
<a name="l12644"><span class="ln">12644 </span></a><span class="s0">excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;</span>
<a name="l12645"><span class="ln">12645 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet</span>
<a name="l12646"><span class="ln">12646 </span></a><span class="s0">and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering,</span>
<a name="l12647"><span class="ln">12647 </span></a><span class="s0">accepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries,</span>
<a name="l12648"><span class="ln">12648 </span></a><span class="s0">could now be thought or spoken of.--&quot;The best fruit in England--</span>
<a name="l12649"><span class="ln">12649 </span></a><span class="s0">every body's favourite--always wholesome.--These the finest beds</span>
<a name="l12650"><span class="ln">12650 </span></a><span class="s0">and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one's self--the only way</span>
<a name="l12651"><span class="ln">12651 </span></a><span class="s0">of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time--never tired--</span>
<a name="l12652"><span class="ln">12652 </span></a><span class="s0">every sort good--hautboy infinitely superior--no comparison--</span>
<a name="l12653"><span class="ln">12653 </span></a><span class="s0">the others hardly eatable--hautboys very scarce--Chili preferred--</span>
<a name="l12654"><span class="ln">12654 </span></a><span class="s0">white wood finest flavour of all--price of strawberries in London--</span>
<a name="l12655"><span class="ln">12655 </span></a><span class="s0">abundance about Bristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to</span>
<a name="l12656"><span class="ln">12656 </span></a><span class="s0">be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly different--no general rule--</span>
<a name="l12657"><span class="ln">12657 </span></a><span class="s0">gardeners never to be put out of their way--delicious fruit--</span>
<a name="l12658"><span class="ln">12658 </span></a><span class="s0">only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior to cherries--</span>
<a name="l12659"><span class="ln">12659 </span></a><span class="s0">currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering strawberries</span>
<a name="l12660"><span class="ln">12660 </span></a><span class="s0">the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no longer--</span>
<a name="l12661"><span class="ln">12661 </span></a><span class="s0">must go and sit in the shade.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12662"><span class="ln">12662 </span></a>
<a name="l12663"><span class="ln">12663 </span></a><span class="s0">Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only</span>
<a name="l12664"><span class="ln">12664 </span></a><span class="s0">once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her</span>
<a name="l12665"><span class="ln">12665 </span></a><span class="s0">son-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--</span>
<a name="l12666"><span class="ln">12666 </span></a><span class="s0">She had some fears of his horse.</span>
<a name="l12667"><span class="ln">12667 </span></a>
<a name="l12668"><span class="ln">12668 </span></a><span class="s0">Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged</span>
<a name="l12669"><span class="ln">12669 </span></a><span class="s0">to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--</span>
<a name="l12670"><span class="ln">12670 </span></a><span class="s0">A situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.  Mrs. Elton</span>
<a name="l12671"><span class="ln">12671 </span></a><span class="s0">had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.</span>
<a name="l12672"><span class="ln">12672 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge,</span>
<a name="l12673"><span class="ln">12673 </span></a><span class="s0">but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them:  it was</span>
<a name="l12674"><span class="ln">12674 </span></a><span class="s0">with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling,</span>
<a name="l12675"><span class="ln">12675 </span></a><span class="s0">a lady known at Maple Grove.  Delightful, charming, superior,</span>
<a name="l12676"><span class="ln">12676 </span></a><span class="s0">first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing--and Mrs. Elton</span>
<a name="l12677"><span class="ln">12677 </span></a><span class="s0">was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side,</span>
<a name="l12678"><span class="ln">12678 </span></a><span class="s0">all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she positively refused</span>
<a name="l12679"><span class="ln">12679 </span></a><span class="s0">to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued</span>
<a name="l12680"><span class="ln">12680 </span></a><span class="s0">to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing,</span>
<a name="l12681"><span class="ln">12681 </span></a><span class="s0">repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.--</span>
<a name="l12682"><span class="ln">12682 </span></a><span class="s0">Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence</span>
<a name="l12683"><span class="ln">12683 </span></a><span class="s0">by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing</span>
<a name="l12684"><span class="ln">12684 </span></a><span class="s0">to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and at last,</span>
<a name="l12685"><span class="ln">12685 </span></a><span class="s0">with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.--</span>
<a name="l12686"><span class="ln">12686 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Should not they walk?  Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens--</span>
<a name="l12687"><span class="ln">12687 </span></a><span class="s0">all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent.&quot;--The pertinacity</span>
<a name="l12688"><span class="ln">12688 </span></a><span class="s0">of her friend seemed more than she could bear.</span>
<a name="l12689"><span class="ln">12689 </span></a>
<a name="l12690"><span class="ln">12690 </span></a><span class="s0">It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,</span>
<a name="l12691"><span class="ln">12691 </span></a><span class="s0">dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly</span>
<a name="l12692"><span class="ln">12692 </span></a><span class="s0">followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short</span>
<a name="l12693"><span class="ln">12693 </span></a><span class="s0">avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal</span>
<a name="l12694"><span class="ln">12694 </span></a><span class="s0">distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.--</span>
<a name="l12695"><span class="ln">12695 </span></a><span class="s0">It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone</span>
<a name="l12696"><span class="ln">12696 </span></a><span class="s0">wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection,</span>
<a name="l12697"><span class="ln">12697 </span></a><span class="s0">to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had</span>
<a name="l12698"><span class="ln">12698 </span></a><span class="s0">been there.  Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such</span>
<a name="l12699"><span class="ln">12699 </span></a><span class="s0">a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view</span>
<a name="l12700"><span class="ln">12700 </span></a><span class="s0">which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly</span>
<a name="l12701"><span class="ln">12701 </span></a><span class="s0">the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper</span>
<a name="l12702"><span class="ln">12702 </span></a><span class="s0">form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank</span>
<a name="l12703"><span class="ln">12703 </span></a><span class="s0">of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--</span>
<a name="l12704"><span class="ln">12704 </span></a><span class="s0">and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered,</span>
<a name="l12705"><span class="ln">12705 </span></a><span class="s0">rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river</span>
<a name="l12706"><span class="ln">12706 </span></a><span class="s0">making a close and handsome curve around it.</span>
<a name="l12707"><span class="ln">12707 </span></a>
<a name="l12708"><span class="ln">12708 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.  English verdure,</span>
<a name="l12709"><span class="ln">12709 </span></a><span class="s0">English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright,</span>
<a name="l12710"><span class="ln">12710 </span></a><span class="s0">without being oppressive.</span>
<a name="l12711"><span class="ln">12711 </span></a>
<a name="l12712"><span class="ln">12712 </span></a><span class="s0">In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled;</span>
<a name="l12713"><span class="ln">12713 </span></a><span class="s0">and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l12714"><span class="ln">12714 </span></a><span class="s0">and Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way.</span>
<a name="l12715"><span class="ln">12715 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was</span>
<a name="l12716"><span class="ln">12716 </span></a><span class="s0">glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned</span>
<a name="l12717"><span class="ln">12717 </span></a><span class="s0">her as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony.</span>
<a name="l12718"><span class="ln">12718 </span></a><span class="s0">Now they seemed in pleasant conversation.  There had been a time</span>
<a name="l12719"><span class="ln">12719 </span></a><span class="s0">also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot</span>
<a name="l12720"><span class="ln">12720 </span></a><span class="s0">so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not.</span>
<a name="l12721"><span class="ln">12721 </span></a><span class="s0">It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity</span>
<a name="l12722"><span class="ln">12722 </span></a><span class="s0">and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom,</span>
<a name="l12723"><span class="ln">12723 </span></a><span class="s0">and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the wall,</span>
<a name="l12724"><span class="ln">12724 </span></a><span class="s0">and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around.</span>
<a name="l12725"><span class="ln">12725 </span></a><span class="s0">He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc.</span>
<a name="l12726"><span class="ln">12726 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, &quot;These are my</span>
<a name="l12727"><span class="ln">12727 </span></a><span class="s0">own concerns.  I have a right to talk on such subjects, without being</span>
<a name="l12728"><span class="ln">12728 </span></a><span class="s0">suspected of introducing Robert Martin.&quot;--She did not suspect him.</span>
<a name="l12729"><span class="ln">12729 </span></a><span class="s0">It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think</span>
<a name="l12730"><span class="ln">12730 </span></a><span class="s0">of Harriet.--They took a few turns together along the walk.--The shade</span>
<a name="l12731"><span class="ln">12731 </span></a><span class="s0">was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of</span>
<a name="l12732"><span class="ln">12732 </span></a><span class="s0">the day.</span>
<a name="l12733"><span class="ln">12733 </span></a>
<a name="l12734"><span class="ln">12734 </span></a><span class="s0">The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--</span>
<a name="l12735"><span class="ln">12735 </span></a><span class="s0">and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did</span>
<a name="l12736"><span class="ln">12736 </span></a><span class="s0">not come.  Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain.  His father would</span>
<a name="l12737"><span class="ln">12737 </span></a><span class="s0">not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could</span>
<a name="l12738"><span class="ln">12738 </span></a><span class="s0">not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare.</span>
<a name="l12739"><span class="ln">12739 </span></a><span class="s0">He had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty.</span>
<a name="l12740"><span class="ln">12740 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting</span>
<a name="l12741"><span class="ln">12741 </span></a><span class="s0">over to them.&quot;--Mrs. Churchill's state, however, as many were ready</span>
<a name="l12742"><span class="ln">12742 </span></a><span class="s0">to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint</span>
<a name="l12743"><span class="ln">12743 </span></a><span class="s0">her nephew in the most reasonable dependence--and Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l12744"><span class="ln">12744 </span></a><span class="s0">was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be</span>
<a name="l12745"><span class="ln">12745 </span></a><span class="s0">by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.--</span>
<a name="l12746"><span class="ln">12746 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;</span>
<a name="l12747"><span class="ln">12747 </span></a><span class="s0">she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.</span>
<a name="l12748"><span class="ln">12748 </span></a>
<a name="l12749"><span class="ln">12749 </span></a><span class="s0">The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more</span>
<a name="l12750"><span class="ln">12750 </span></a><span class="s0">to see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds;</span>
<a name="l12751"><span class="ln">12751 </span></a><span class="s0">perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting</span>
<a name="l12752"><span class="ln">12752 </span></a><span class="s0">on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot,</span>
<a name="l12753"><span class="ln">12753 </span></a><span class="s0">and growing cool again.--Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken</span>
<a name="l12754"><span class="ln">12754 </span></a><span class="s0">his little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no</span>
<a name="l12755"><span class="ln">12755 </span></a><span class="s0">damps from the river were imagined even by him, stirred no more;</span>
<a name="l12756"><span class="ln">12756 </span></a><span class="s0">and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that Mrs. Weston</span>
<a name="l12757"><span class="ln">12757 </span></a><span class="s0">might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety</span>
<a name="l12758"><span class="ln">12758 </span></a><span class="s0">which her spirits seemed to need.</span>
<a name="l12759"><span class="ln">12759 </span></a>
<a name="l12760"><span class="ln">12760 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's</span>
<a name="l12761"><span class="ln">12761 </span></a><span class="s0">entertainment.  Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos,</span>
<a name="l12762"><span class="ln">12762 </span></a><span class="s0">corals, shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets,</span>
<a name="l12763"><span class="ln">12763 </span></a><span class="s0">had been prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning;</span>
<a name="l12764"><span class="ln">12764 </span></a><span class="s0">and the kindness had perfectly answered.  Mr. Woodhouse had been</span>
<a name="l12765"><span class="ln">12765 </span></a><span class="s0">exceedingly well amused.  Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him,</span>
<a name="l12766"><span class="ln">12766 </span></a><span class="s0">and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other</span>
<a name="l12767"><span class="ln">12767 </span></a><span class="s0">resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw,</span>
<a name="l12768"><span class="ln">12768 </span></a><span class="s0">for he was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking</span>
<a name="l12769"><span class="ln">12769 </span></a><span class="s0">over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake</span>
<a name="l12770"><span class="ln">12770 </span></a><span class="s0">of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot</span>
<a name="l12771"><span class="ln">12771 </span></a><span class="s0">of the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared,</span>
<a name="l12772"><span class="ln">12772 </span></a><span class="s0">coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.--</span>
<a name="l12773"><span class="ln">12773 </span></a><span class="s0">Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start</span>
<a name="l12774"><span class="ln">12774 </span></a><span class="s0">at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.</span>
<a name="l12775"><span class="ln">12775 </span></a>
<a name="l12776"><span class="ln">12776 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Will you be so kind,&quot; said she, &quot;when I am missed, as to say</span>
<a name="l12777"><span class="ln">12777 </span></a><span class="s0">that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware</span>
<a name="l12778"><span class="ln">12778 </span></a><span class="s0">how late it is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we</span>
<a name="l12779"><span class="ln">12779 </span></a><span class="s0">shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.--I have said</span>
<a name="l12780"><span class="ln">12780 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing about it to any body.  It would only be giving trouble</span>
<a name="l12781"><span class="ln">12781 </span></a><span class="s0">and distress.  Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk.</span>
<a name="l12782"><span class="ln">12782 </span></a><span class="s0">Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do,</span>
<a name="l12783"><span class="ln">12783 </span></a><span class="s0">will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12784"><span class="ln">12784 </span></a>
<a name="l12785"><span class="ln">12785 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk</span>
<a name="l12786"><span class="ln">12786 </span></a><span class="s0">to Highbury alone?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12787"><span class="ln">12787 </span></a>
<a name="l12788"><span class="ln">12788 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast.  I shall be at home</span>
<a name="l12789"><span class="ln">12789 </span></a><span class="s0">in twenty minutes.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12790"><span class="ln">12790 </span></a>
<a name="l12791"><span class="ln">12791 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone.</span>
<a name="l12792"><span class="ln">12792 </span></a><span class="s0">Let my father's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage.</span>
<a name="l12793"><span class="ln">12793 </span></a><span class="s0">It can be round in five minutes.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12794"><span class="ln">12794 </span></a>
<a name="l12795"><span class="ln">12795 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--</span>
<a name="l12796"><span class="ln">12796 </span></a><span class="s0">And for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have</span>
<a name="l12797"><span class="ln">12797 </span></a><span class="s0">to guard others!&quot;</span>
<a name="l12798"><span class="ln">12798 </span></a>
<a name="l12799"><span class="ln">12799 </span></a><span class="s0">She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,</span>
<a name="l12800"><span class="ln">12800 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now.</span>
<a name="l12801"><span class="ln">12801 </span></a><span class="s0">I must order the carriage.  The heat even would be danger.--You are</span>
<a name="l12802"><span class="ln">12802 </span></a><span class="s0">fatigued already.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12803"><span class="ln">12803 </span></a>
<a name="l12804"><span class="ln">12804 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am,&quot;--she answered--&quot;I am fatigued; but it is not the sort</span>
<a name="l12805"><span class="ln">12805 </span></a><span class="s0">of fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all</span>
<a name="l12806"><span class="ln">12806 </span></a><span class="s0">know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits.  Mine, I confess,</span>
<a name="l12807"><span class="ln">12807 </span></a><span class="s0">are exhausted.  The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let</span>
<a name="l12808"><span class="ln">12808 </span></a><span class="s0">me have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12809"><span class="ln">12809 </span></a>
<a name="l12810"><span class="ln">12810 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had not another word to oppose.  She saw it all; and entering</span>
<a name="l12811"><span class="ln">12811 </span></a><span class="s0">into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately,</span>
<a name="l12812"><span class="ln">12812 </span></a><span class="s0">and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend.  Her parting</span>
<a name="l12813"><span class="ln">12813 </span></a><span class="s0">look was grateful--and her parting words, &quot;Oh!  Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l12814"><span class="ln">12814 </span></a><span class="s0">the comfort of being sometimes alone!&quot;--seemed to burst from</span>
<a name="l12815"><span class="ln">12815 </span></a><span class="s0">an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual</span>
<a name="l12816"><span class="ln">12816 </span></a><span class="s0">endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who</span>
<a name="l12817"><span class="ln">12817 </span></a><span class="s0">loved her best.</span>
<a name="l12818"><span class="ln">12818 </span></a>
<a name="l12819"><span class="ln">12819 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!&quot; said Emma, as she turned back</span>
<a name="l12820"><span class="ln">12820 </span></a><span class="s0">into the hall again.  &quot;I do pity you.  And the more sensibility</span>
<a name="l12821"><span class="ln">12821 </span></a><span class="s0">you betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12822"><span class="ln">12822 </span></a>
<a name="l12823"><span class="ln">12823 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only</span>
<a name="l12824"><span class="ln">12824 </span></a><span class="s0">accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank</span>
<a name="l12825"><span class="ln">12825 </span></a><span class="s0">Churchill entered the room.  Emma had not been thinking of him,</span>
<a name="l12826"><span class="ln">12826 </span></a><span class="s0">she had forgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him.</span>
<a name="l12827"><span class="ln">12827 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston would be at ease.  The black mare was blameless;</span>
<a name="l12828"><span class="ln">12828 </span></a><span class="s0">_they_ were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause.</span>
<a name="l12829"><span class="ln">12829 </span></a><span class="s0">He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her;</span>
<a name="l12830"><span class="ln">12830 </span></a><span class="s0">a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours--and he had quite given</span>
<a name="l12831"><span class="ln">12831 </span></a><span class="s0">up every thought of coming, till very late;--and had he known how hot</span>
<a name="l12832"><span class="ln">12832 </span></a><span class="s0">a ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be,</span>
<a name="l12833"><span class="ln">12833 </span></a><span class="s0">he believed he should not have come at all.  The heat was excessive;</span>
<a name="l12834"><span class="ln">12834 </span></a><span class="s0">he had never suffered any thing like it--almost wished he had staid</span>
<a name="l12835"><span class="ln">12835 </span></a><span class="s0">at home--nothing killed him like heat--he could bear any degree of cold,</span>
<a name="l12836"><span class="ln">12836 </span></a><span class="s0">etc., but heat was intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest</span>
<a name="l12837"><span class="ln">12837 </span></a><span class="s0">possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire,</span>
<a name="l12838"><span class="ln">12838 </span></a><span class="s0">looking very deplorable.</span>
<a name="l12839"><span class="ln">12839 </span></a>
<a name="l12840"><span class="ln">12840 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,&quot; said Emma.</span>
<a name="l12841"><span class="ln">12841 </span></a>
<a name="l12842"><span class="ln">12842 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again.  I could very</span>
<a name="l12843"><span class="ln">12843 </span></a><span class="s0">ill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming!</span>
<a name="l12844"><span class="ln">12844 </span></a><span class="s0">You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up.</span>
<a name="l12845"><span class="ln">12845 </span></a><span class="s0">I met _one_ as I came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!&quot;</span>
<a name="l12846"><span class="ln">12846 </span></a>
<a name="l12847"><span class="ln">12847 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's</span>
<a name="l12848"><span class="ln">12848 </span></a><span class="s0">state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being</span>
<a name="l12849"><span class="ln">12849 </span></a><span class="s0">out of humour.  Some people were always cross when they were hot.</span>
<a name="l12850"><span class="ln">12850 </span></a><span class="s0">Such might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating</span>
<a name="l12851"><span class="ln">12851 </span></a><span class="s0">and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints,</span>
<a name="l12852"><span class="ln">12852 </span></a><span class="s0">she recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance</span>
<a name="l12853"><span class="ln">12853 </span></a><span class="s0">of every thing in the dining-room--and she humanely pointed out</span>
<a name="l12854"><span class="ln">12854 </span></a><span class="s0">the door.</span>
<a name="l12855"><span class="ln">12855 </span></a>
<a name="l12856"><span class="ln">12856 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No--he should not eat.  He was not hungry; it would only make</span>
<a name="l12857"><span class="ln">12857 </span></a><span class="s0">him hotter.&quot;  In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour;</span>
<a name="l12858"><span class="ln">12858 </span></a><span class="s0">and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off.  Emma returned</span>
<a name="l12859"><span class="ln">12859 </span></a><span class="s0">all her attention to her father, saying in secret--</span>
<a name="l12860"><span class="ln">12860 </span></a>
<a name="l12861"><span class="ln">12861 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am glad I have done being in love with him.  I should not like a</span>
<a name="l12862"><span class="ln">12862 </span></a><span class="s0">man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning.  Harriet's sweet</span>
<a name="l12863"><span class="ln">12863 </span></a><span class="s0">easy temper will not mind it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12864"><span class="ln">12864 </span></a>
<a name="l12865"><span class="ln">12865 </span></a><span class="s0">He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came</span>
<a name="l12866"><span class="ln">12866 </span></a><span class="s0">back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners,</span>
<a name="l12867"><span class="ln">12867 </span></a><span class="s0">like himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest</span>
<a name="l12868"><span class="ln">12868 </span></a><span class="s0">in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he</span>
<a name="l12869"><span class="ln">12869 </span></a><span class="s0">should be so late.  He was not in his best spirits, but seemed</span>
<a name="l12870"><span class="ln">12870 </span></a><span class="s0">trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense</span>
<a name="l12871"><span class="ln">12871 </span></a><span class="s0">very agreeably.  They were looking over views in Swisserland.</span>
<a name="l12872"><span class="ln">12872 </span></a>
<a name="l12873"><span class="ln">12873 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,&quot; said he.</span>
<a name="l12874"><span class="ln">12874 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places.</span>
<a name="l12875"><span class="ln">12875 </span></a><span class="s0">You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour</span>
<a name="l12876"><span class="ln">12876 </span></a><span class="s0">to read--or my poem.  I shall do something to expose myself.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12877"><span class="ln">12877 </span></a>
<a name="l12878"><span class="ln">12878 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland.  You will</span>
<a name="l12879"><span class="ln">12879 </span></a><span class="s0">never go to Swisserland.  Your uncle and aunt will never allow</span>
<a name="l12880"><span class="ln">12880 </span></a><span class="s0">you to leave England.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12881"><span class="ln">12881 </span></a>
<a name="l12882"><span class="ln">12882 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;They may be induced to go too.  A warm climate may be prescribed</span>
<a name="l12883"><span class="ln">12883 </span></a><span class="s0">for her.  I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad.</span>
<a name="l12884"><span class="ln">12884 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you I have.  I feel a strong persuasion, this morning,</span>
<a name="l12885"><span class="ln">12885 </span></a><span class="s0">that I shall soon be abroad.  I ought to travel.  I am tired</span>
<a name="l12886"><span class="ln">12886 </span></a><span class="s0">of doing nothing.  I want a change.  I am serious, Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l12887"><span class="ln">12887 </span></a><span class="s0">whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--</span>
<a name="l12888"><span class="ln">12888 </span></a><span class="s0">and would leave it to-morrow, if I could.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12889"><span class="ln">12889 </span></a>
<a name="l12890"><span class="ln">12890 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are sick of prosperity and indulgence.  Cannot you invent</span>
<a name="l12891"><span class="ln">12891 </span></a><span class="s0">a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12892"><span class="ln">12892 </span></a>
<a name="l12893"><span class="ln">12893 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence!  You are quite mistaken.</span>
<a name="l12894"><span class="ln">12894 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged.  I am</span>
<a name="l12895"><span class="ln">12895 </span></a><span class="s0">thwarted in every thing material.  I do not consider myself at all</span>
<a name="l12896"><span class="ln">12896 </span></a><span class="s0">a fortunate person.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12897"><span class="ln">12897 </span></a>
<a name="l12898"><span class="ln">12898 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came.</span>
<a name="l12899"><span class="ln">12899 </span></a><span class="s0">Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well.</span>
<a name="l12900"><span class="ln">12900 </span></a><span class="s0">Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water,</span>
<a name="l12901"><span class="ln">12901 </span></a><span class="s0">will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12902"><span class="ln">12902 </span></a>
<a name="l12903"><span class="ln">12903 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No--I shall not stir.  I shall sit by you.  You are my best cure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12904"><span class="ln">12904 </span></a>
<a name="l12905"><span class="ln">12905 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us.</span>
<a name="l12906"><span class="ln">12906 </span></a><span class="s0">It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young</span>
<a name="l12907"><span class="ln">12907 </span></a><span class="s0">man so much in want of a change.  You will stay, and go with us?&quot;</span>
<a name="l12908"><span class="ln">12908 </span></a>
<a name="l12909"><span class="ln">12909 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12910"><span class="ln">12910 </span></a>
<a name="l12911"><span class="ln">12911 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12912"><span class="ln">12912 </span></a>
<a name="l12913"><span class="ln">12913 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No--It will not be worth while.  If I come, I shall be cross.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12914"><span class="ln">12914 </span></a>
<a name="l12915"><span class="ln">12915 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Then pray stay at Richmond.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12916"><span class="ln">12916 </span></a>
<a name="l12917"><span class="ln">12917 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But if I do, I shall be crosser still.  I can never bear to think</span>
<a name="l12918"><span class="ln">12918 </span></a><span class="s0">of you all there without me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12919"><span class="ln">12919 </span></a>
<a name="l12920"><span class="ln">12920 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself.</span>
<a name="l12921"><span class="ln">12921 </span></a><span class="s0">Chuse your own degree of crossness.  I shall press you no more.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12922"><span class="ln">12922 </span></a>
<a name="l12923"><span class="ln">12923 </span></a><span class="s0">The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.</span>
<a name="l12924"><span class="ln">12924 </span></a><span class="s0">With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill;</span>
<a name="l12925"><span class="ln">12925 </span></a><span class="s0">others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress</span>
<a name="l12926"><span class="ln">12926 </span></a><span class="s0">and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained.</span>
<a name="l12927"><span class="ln">12927 </span></a><span class="s0">That it was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with</span>
<a name="l12928"><span class="ln">12928 </span></a><span class="s0">a short final arrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted.</span>
<a name="l12929"><span class="ln">12929 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank Churchill's little inclination to exclude himself increased</span>
<a name="l12930"><span class="ln">12930 </span></a><span class="s0">so much, that his last words to Emma were,</span>
<a name="l12931"><span class="ln">12931 </span></a>
<a name="l12932"><span class="ln">12932 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well;--if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12933"><span class="ln">12933 </span></a>
<a name="l12934"><span class="ln">12934 </span></a><span class="s0">She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from</span>
<a name="l12935"><span class="ln">12935 </span></a><span class="s0">Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.</span>
<a name="l12936"><span class="ln">12936 </span></a>
<a name="l12937"><span class="ln">12937 </span></a>
<a name="l12938"><span class="ln">12938 </span></a>
<a name="l12939"><span class="ln">12939 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER VII</span>
<a name="l12940"><span class="ln">12940 </span></a>
<a name="l12941"><span class="ln">12941 </span></a>
<a name="l12942"><span class="ln">12942 </span></a><span class="s0">They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward</span>
<a name="l12943"><span class="ln">12943 </span></a><span class="s0">circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality,</span>
<a name="l12944"><span class="ln">12944 </span></a><span class="s0">were in favour of a pleasant party.  Mr. Weston directed the whole,</span>
<a name="l12945"><span class="ln">12945 </span></a><span class="s0">officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every</span>
<a name="l12946"><span class="ln">12946 </span></a><span class="s0">body was in good time.  Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates</span>
<a name="l12947"><span class="ln">12947 </span></a><span class="s0">and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback.</span>
<a name="l12948"><span class="ln">12948 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse.  Nothing was wanting</span>
<a name="l12949"><span class="ln">12949 </span></a><span class="s0">but to be happy when they got there.  Seven miles were travelled</span>
<a name="l12950"><span class="ln">12950 </span></a><span class="s0">in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration</span>
<a name="l12951"><span class="ln">12951 </span></a><span class="s0">on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there</span>
<a name="l12952"><span class="ln">12952 </span></a><span class="s0">was deficiency.  There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union,</span>
<a name="l12953"><span class="ln">12953 </span></a><span class="s0">which could not be got over.  They separated too much into parties.</span>
<a name="l12954"><span class="ln">12954 </span></a><span class="s0">The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss</span>
<a name="l12955"><span class="ln">12955 </span></a><span class="s0">Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.</span>
<a name="l12956"><span class="ln">12956 </span></a><span class="s0">And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better.  It seemed</span>
<a name="l12957"><span class="ln">12957 </span></a><span class="s0">at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied.</span>
<a name="l12958"><span class="ln">12958 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix,</span>
<a name="l12959"><span class="ln">12959 </span></a><span class="s0">and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours</span>
<a name="l12960"><span class="ln">12960 </span></a><span class="s0">that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation,</span>
<a name="l12961"><span class="ln">12961 </span></a><span class="s0">between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any</span>
<a name="l12962"><span class="ln">12962 </span></a><span class="s0">cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.</span>
<a name="l12963"><span class="ln">12963 </span></a>
<a name="l12964"><span class="ln">12964 </span></a><span class="s0">At first it was downright dulness to Emma.  She had never seen Frank</span>
<a name="l12965"><span class="ln">12965 </span></a><span class="s0">Churchill so silent and stupid.  He said nothing worth hearing--</span>
<a name="l12966"><span class="ln">12966 </span></a><span class="s0">looked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without</span>
<a name="l12967"><span class="ln">12967 </span></a><span class="s0">knowing what she said.  While he was so dull, it was no wonder that</span>
<a name="l12968"><span class="ln">12968 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.</span>
<a name="l12969"><span class="ln">12969 </span></a>
<a name="l12970"><span class="ln">12970 </span></a><span class="s0">When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,</span>
<a name="l12971"><span class="ln">12971 </span></a><span class="s0">for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.</span>
<a name="l12972"><span class="ln">12972 </span></a><span class="s0">Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.</span>
<a name="l12973"><span class="ln">12973 </span></a><span class="s0">To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he</span>
<a name="l12974"><span class="ln">12974 </span></a><span class="s0">cared for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,</span>
<a name="l12975"><span class="ln">12975 </span></a><span class="s0">was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement,</span>
<a name="l12976"><span class="ln">12976 </span></a><span class="s0">the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first</span>
<a name="l12977"><span class="ln">12977 </span></a><span class="s0">and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now,</span>
<a name="l12978"><span class="ln">12978 </span></a><span class="s0">in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most</span>
<a name="l12979"><span class="ln">12979 </span></a><span class="s0">people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English</span>
<a name="l12980"><span class="ln">12980 </span></a><span class="s0">word but flirtation could very well describe.  &quot;Mr. Frank Churchill</span>
<a name="l12981"><span class="ln">12981 </span></a><span class="s0">and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively.&quot;  They were laying</span>
<a name="l12982"><span class="ln">12982 </span></a><span class="s0">themselves open to that very phrase--and to having it sent off</span>
<a name="l12983"><span class="ln">12983 </span></a><span class="s0">in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another.</span>
<a name="l12984"><span class="ln">12984 </span></a><span class="s0">Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity;</span>
<a name="l12985"><span class="ln">12985 </span></a><span class="s0">it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected.</span>
<a name="l12986"><span class="ln">12986 </span></a><span class="s0">She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him</span>
<a name="l12987"><span class="ln">12987 </span></a><span class="s0">for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,</span>
<a name="l12988"><span class="ln">12988 </span></a><span class="s0">admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning</span>
<a name="l12989"><span class="ln">12989 </span></a><span class="s0">back her heart.  She still intended him for her friend.</span>
<a name="l12990"><span class="ln">12990 </span></a>
<a name="l12991"><span class="ln">12991 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How much I am obliged to you,&quot; said he, &quot;for telling me to come to-day!--</span>
<a name="l12992"><span class="ln">12992 </span></a><span class="s0">If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the</span>
<a name="l12993"><span class="ln">12993 </span></a><span class="s0">happiness of this party.  I had quite determined to go away again.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12994"><span class="ln">12994 </span></a>
<a name="l12995"><span class="ln">12995 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about,</span>
<a name="l12996"><span class="ln">12996 </span></a><span class="s0">except that you were too late for the best strawberries.</span>
<a name="l12997"><span class="ln">12997 </span></a><span class="s0">I was a kinder friend than you deserved.  But you were humble.</span>
<a name="l12998"><span class="ln">12998 </span></a><span class="s0">You begged hard to be commanded to come.&quot;</span>
<a name="l12999"><span class="ln">12999 </span></a>
<a name="l13000"><span class="ln">13000 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Don't say I was cross.  I was fatigued.  The heat overcame me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13001"><span class="ln">13001 </span></a>
<a name="l13002"><span class="ln">13002 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is hotter to-day.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13003"><span class="ln">13003 </span></a>
<a name="l13004"><span class="ln">13004 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not to my feelings.  I am perfectly comfortable to-day.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13005"><span class="ln">13005 </span></a>
<a name="l13006"><span class="ln">13006 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are comfortable because you are under command.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13007"><span class="ln">13007 </span></a>
<a name="l13008"><span class="ln">13008 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Your command?--Yes.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13009"><span class="ln">13009 </span></a>
<a name="l13010"><span class="ln">13010 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,</span>
<a name="l13011"><span class="ln">13011 </span></a><span class="s0">somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your</span>
<a name="l13012"><span class="ln">13012 </span></a><span class="s0">own management; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot</span>
<a name="l13013"><span class="ln">13013 </span></a><span class="s0">be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your</span>
<a name="l13014"><span class="ln">13014 </span></a><span class="s0">own command rather than mine.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13015"><span class="ln">13015 </span></a>
<a name="l13016"><span class="ln">13016 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It comes to the same thing.  I can have no self-command without</span>
<a name="l13017"><span class="ln">13017 </span></a><span class="s0">a motive.  You order me, whether you speak or not.  And you can</span>
<a name="l13018"><span class="ln">13018 </span></a><span class="s0">be always with me.  You are always with me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13019"><span class="ln">13019 </span></a>
<a name="l13020"><span class="ln">13020 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Dating from three o'clock yesterday.  My perpetual influence</span>
<a name="l13021"><span class="ln">13021 </span></a><span class="s0">could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much</span>
<a name="l13022"><span class="ln">13022 </span></a><span class="s0">out of humour before.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13023"><span class="ln">13023 </span></a>
<a name="l13024"><span class="ln">13024 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Three o'clock yesterday!  That is your date.  I thought I had seen</span>
<a name="l13025"><span class="ln">13025 </span></a><span class="s0">you first in February.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13026"><span class="ln">13026 </span></a>
<a name="l13027"><span class="ln">13027 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Your gallantry is really unanswerable.  But (lowering her voice)--</span>
<a name="l13028"><span class="ln">13028 </span></a><span class="s0">nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be</span>
<a name="l13029"><span class="ln">13029 </span></a><span class="s0">talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13030"><span class="ln">13030 </span></a>
<a name="l13031"><span class="ln">13031 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I say nothing of which I am ashamed,&quot; replied he, with lively impudence.</span>
<a name="l13032"><span class="ln">13032 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I saw you first in February.  Let every body on the Hill hear me if</span>
<a name="l13033"><span class="ln">13033 </span></a><span class="s0">they can.  Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking</span>
<a name="l13034"><span class="ln">13034 </span></a><span class="s0">on the other.  I saw you first in February.&quot;  And then whispering--</span>
<a name="l13035"><span class="ln">13035 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Our companions are excessively stupid.  What shall we do to rouse them?</span>
<a name="l13036"><span class="ln">13036 </span></a><span class="s0">Any nonsense will serve.  They _shall_ talk.  Ladies and gentlemen,</span>
<a name="l13037"><span class="ln">13037 </span></a><span class="s0">I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides)</span>
<a name="l13038"><span class="ln">13038 </span></a><span class="s0">to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13039"><span class="ln">13039 </span></a>
<a name="l13040"><span class="ln">13040 </span></a><span class="s0">Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great deal;</span>
<a name="l13041"><span class="ln">13041 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding;</span>
<a name="l13042"><span class="ln">13042 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct.</span>
<a name="l13043"><span class="ln">13043 </span></a>
<a name="l13044"><span class="ln">13044 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are</span>
<a name="l13045"><span class="ln">13045 </span></a><span class="s0">all thinking of?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13046"><span class="ln">13046 </span></a>
<a name="l13047"><span class="ln">13047 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no, no&quot;--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--</span>
<a name="l13048"><span class="ln">13048 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon no account in the world.  It is the very last thing I</span>
<a name="l13049"><span class="ln">13049 </span></a><span class="s0">would stand the brunt of just now.  Let me hear any thing rather</span>
<a name="l13050"><span class="ln">13050 </span></a><span class="s0">than what you are all thinking of.  I will not say quite all.</span>
<a name="l13051"><span class="ln">13051 </span></a><span class="s0">There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,)</span>
<a name="l13052"><span class="ln">13052 </span></a><span class="s0">whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13053"><span class="ln">13053 </span></a>
<a name="l13054"><span class="ln">13054 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is a sort of thing,&quot; cried Mrs. Elton emphatically,</span>
<a name="l13055"><span class="ln">13055 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to</span>
<a name="l13056"><span class="ln">13056 </span></a><span class="s0">inquire into.  Though, perhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party--</span>
<a name="l13057"><span class="ln">13057 </span></a><span class="s0">_I_ never was in any circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--&quot;</span>
<a name="l13058"><span class="ln">13058 </span></a>
<a name="l13059"><span class="ln">13059 </span></a><span class="s0">Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured,</span>
<a name="l13060"><span class="ln">13060 </span></a><span class="s0">in reply,</span>
<a name="l13061"><span class="ln">13061 </span></a>
<a name="l13062"><span class="ln">13062 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very true, my love, very true.  Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard of--</span>
<a name="l13063"><span class="ln">13063 </span></a><span class="s0">but some ladies say any thing.  Better pass it off as a joke.</span>
<a name="l13064"><span class="ln">13064 </span></a><span class="s0">Every body knows what is due to _you_.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13065"><span class="ln">13065 </span></a>
<a name="l13066"><span class="ln">13066 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It will not do,&quot; whispered Frank to Emma; &quot;they are most</span>
<a name="l13067"><span class="ln">13067 </span></a><span class="s0">of them affronted.  I will attack them with more address.</span>
<a name="l13068"><span class="ln">13068 </span></a><span class="s0">Ladies and gentlemen--I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she</span>
<a name="l13069"><span class="ln">13069 </span></a><span class="s0">waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of,</span>
<a name="l13070"><span class="ln">13070 </span></a><span class="s0">and only requires something very entertaining from each of you,</span>
<a name="l13071"><span class="ln">13071 </span></a><span class="s0">in a general way.  Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she</span>
<a name="l13072"><span class="ln">13072 </span></a><span class="s0">is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only</span>
<a name="l13073"><span class="ln">13073 </span></a><span class="s0">demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose</span>
<a name="l13074"><span class="ln">13074 </span></a><span class="s0">or verse, original or repeated--or two things moderately clever--</span>
<a name="l13075"><span class="ln">13075 </span></a><span class="s0">or three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily</span>
<a name="l13076"><span class="ln">13076 </span></a><span class="s0">at them all.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13077"><span class="ln">13077 </span></a>
<a name="l13078"><span class="ln">13078 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! very well,&quot; exclaimed Miss Bates, &quot;then I need not be uneasy.</span>
<a name="l13079"><span class="ln">13079 </span></a><span class="s0">`Three things very dull indeed.'  That will just do for me, you know.</span>
<a name="l13080"><span class="ln">13080 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open</span>
<a name="l13081"><span class="ln">13081 </span></a><span class="s0">my mouth, shan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured</span>
<a name="l13082"><span class="ln">13082 </span></a><span class="s0">dependence on every body's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13083"><span class="ln">13083 </span></a>
<a name="l13084"><span class="ln">13084 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not resist.</span>
<a name="l13085"><span class="ln">13085 </span></a>
<a name="l13086"><span class="ln">13086 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty.  Pardon me--but you</span>
<a name="l13087"><span class="ln">13087 </span></a><span class="s0">will be limited as to number--only three at once.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13088"><span class="ln">13088 </span></a>
<a name="l13089"><span class="ln">13089 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not</span>
<a name="l13090"><span class="ln">13090 </span></a><span class="s0">immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could</span>
<a name="l13091"><span class="ln">13091 </span></a><span class="s0">not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.</span>
<a name="l13092"><span class="ln">13092 </span></a>
<a name="l13093"><span class="ln">13093 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!--well--to be sure.  Yes, I see what she means, (turning to</span>
<a name="l13094"><span class="ln">13094 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue.  I must make</span>
<a name="l13095"><span class="ln">13095 </span></a><span class="s0">myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing</span>
<a name="l13096"><span class="ln">13096 </span></a><span class="s0">to an old friend.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13097"><span class="ln">13097 </span></a>
<a name="l13098"><span class="ln">13098 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I like your plan,&quot; cried Mr. Weston.  &quot;Agreed, agreed.  I will do</span>
<a name="l13099"><span class="ln">13099 </span></a><span class="s0">my best.  I am making a conundrum.  How will a conundrum reckon?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13100"><span class="ln">13100 </span></a>
<a name="l13101"><span class="ln">13101 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,&quot; answered his son;--&quot;but we shall</span>
<a name="l13102"><span class="ln">13102 </span></a><span class="s0">be indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13103"><span class="ln">13103 </span></a>
<a name="l13104"><span class="ln">13104 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, no,&quot; said Emma, &quot;it will not reckon low.  A conundrum of</span>
<a name="l13105"><span class="ln">13105 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour.  Come, sir,</span>
<a name="l13106"><span class="ln">13106 </span></a><span class="s0">pray let me hear it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13107"><span class="ln">13107 </span></a>
<a name="l13108"><span class="ln">13108 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I doubt its being very clever myself,&quot; said Mr. Weston.</span>
<a name="l13109"><span class="ln">13109 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters</span>
<a name="l13110"><span class="ln">13110 </span></a><span class="s0">of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13111"><span class="ln">13111 </span></a>
<a name="l13112"><span class="ln">13112 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What two letters!--express perfection!  I am sure I do not know.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13113"><span class="ln">13113 </span></a>
<a name="l13114"><span class="ln">13114 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! you will never guess.  You, (to Emma), I am certain, will</span>
<a name="l13115"><span class="ln">13115 </span></a><span class="s0">never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13116"><span class="ln">13116 </span></a>
<a name="l13117"><span class="ln">13117 </span></a><span class="s0">Understanding and gratification came together.  It might be a very</span>
<a name="l13118"><span class="ln">13118 </span></a><span class="s0">indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh</span>
<a name="l13119"><span class="ln">13119 </span></a><span class="s0">at and enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem</span>
<a name="l13120"><span class="ln">13120 </span></a><span class="s0">to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid</span>
<a name="l13121"><span class="ln">13121 </span></a><span class="s0">about it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said,</span>
<a name="l13122"><span class="ln">13122 </span></a>
<a name="l13123"><span class="ln">13123 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston</span>
<a name="l13124"><span class="ln">13124 </span></a><span class="s0">has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every</span>
<a name="l13125"><span class="ln">13125 </span></a><span class="s0">body else.  _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13126"><span class="ln">13126 </span></a>
<a name="l13127"><span class="ln">13127 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,&quot; said Mrs. Elton;</span>
<a name="l13128"><span class="ln">13128 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;_I_ really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing.</span>
<a name="l13129"><span class="ln">13129 </span></a><span class="s0">I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not</span>
<a name="l13130"><span class="ln">13130 </span></a><span class="s0">at all pleased with.  I knew who it came from.  An abominable puppy!--</span>
<a name="l13131"><span class="ln">13131 </span></a><span class="s0">You know who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things</span>
<a name="l13132"><span class="ln">13132 </span></a><span class="s0">are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire;</span>
<a name="l13133"><span class="ln">13133 </span></a><span class="s0">but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring</span>
<a name="l13134"><span class="ln">13134 </span></a><span class="s0">about the country in summer.  Miss Woodhouse must excuse me.</span>
<a name="l13135"><span class="ln">13135 </span></a><span class="s0">I am not one of those who have witty things at every body's service.</span>
<a name="l13136"><span class="ln">13136 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not pretend to be a wit.  I have a great deal of vivacity</span>
<a name="l13137"><span class="ln">13137 </span></a><span class="s0">in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak</span>
<a name="l13138"><span class="ln">13138 </span></a><span class="s0">and when to hold my tongue.  Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill.</span>
<a name="l13139"><span class="ln">13139 </span></a><span class="s0">Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself.  We have nothing clever to say--</span>
<a name="l13140"><span class="ln">13140 </span></a><span class="s0">not one of us.</span>
<a name="l13141"><span class="ln">13141 </span></a>
<a name="l13142"><span class="ln">13142 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,&quot; added her husband, with a sort of</span>
<a name="l13143"><span class="ln">13143 </span></a><span class="s0">sneering consciousness; &quot;_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain</span>
<a name="l13144"><span class="ln">13144 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady.  An old married man--</span>
<a name="l13145"><span class="ln">13145 </span></a><span class="s0">quite good for nothing.  Shall we walk, Augusta?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13146"><span class="ln">13146 </span></a>
<a name="l13147"><span class="ln">13147 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;With all my heart.  I am really tired of exploring so long</span>
<a name="l13148"><span class="ln">13148 </span></a><span class="s0">on one spot.  Come, Jane, take my other arm.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13149"><span class="ln">13149 </span></a>
<a name="l13150"><span class="ln">13150 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.</span>
<a name="l13151"><span class="ln">13151 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Happy couple!&quot; said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out</span>
<a name="l13152"><span class="ln">13152 </span></a><span class="s0">of hearing:--&quot;How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as</span>
<a name="l13153"><span class="ln">13153 </span></a><span class="s0">they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only</span>
<a name="l13154"><span class="ln">13154 </span></a><span class="s0">knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!  Peculiarly lucky!--</span>
<a name="l13155"><span class="ln">13155 </span></a><span class="s0">for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath,</span>
<a name="l13156"><span class="ln">13156 </span></a><span class="s0">or any public place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be</span>
<a name="l13157"><span class="ln">13157 </span></a><span class="s0">no knowledge.  It is only by seeing women in their own homes,</span>
<a name="l13158"><span class="ln">13158 </span></a><span class="s0">among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form</span>
<a name="l13159"><span class="ln">13159 </span></a><span class="s0">any just judgment.  Short of that, it is all guess and luck--</span>
<a name="l13160"><span class="ln">13160 </span></a><span class="s0">and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself</span>
<a name="l13161"><span class="ln">13161 </span></a><span class="s0">on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!&quot;</span>
<a name="l13162"><span class="ln">13162 </span></a>
<a name="l13163"><span class="ln">13163 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her</span>
<a name="l13164"><span class="ln">13164 </span></a><span class="s0">own confederates, spoke now.</span>
<a name="l13165"><span class="ln">13165 </span></a>
<a name="l13166"><span class="ln">13166 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Such things do occur, undoubtedly.&quot;--She was stopped by a cough.</span>
<a name="l13167"><span class="ln">13167 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.</span>
<a name="l13168"><span class="ln">13168 </span></a>
<a name="l13169"><span class="ln">13169 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You were speaking,&quot; said he, gravely.  She recovered her voice.</span>
<a name="l13170"><span class="ln">13170 </span></a>
<a name="l13171"><span class="ln">13171 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances</span>
<a name="l13172"><span class="ln">13172 </span></a><span class="s0">do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them</span>
<a name="l13173"><span class="ln">13173 </span></a><span class="s0">to be very frequent.  A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--</span>
<a name="l13174"><span class="ln">13174 </span></a><span class="s0">but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards.  I would</span>
<a name="l13175"><span class="ln">13175 </span></a><span class="s0">be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters,</span>
<a name="l13176"><span class="ln">13176 </span></a><span class="s0">(whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)</span>
<a name="l13177"><span class="ln">13177 </span></a><span class="s0">who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience,</span>
<a name="l13178"><span class="ln">13178 </span></a><span class="s0">an oppression for ever.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13179"><span class="ln">13179 </span></a>
<a name="l13180"><span class="ln">13180 </span></a><span class="s0">He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon</span>
<a name="l13181"><span class="ln">13181 </span></a><span class="s0">afterwards said, in a lively tone,</span>
<a name="l13182"><span class="ln">13182 </span></a>
<a name="l13183"><span class="ln">13183 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever</span>
<a name="l13184"><span class="ln">13184 </span></a><span class="s0">I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me.  Will you?</span>
<a name="l13185"><span class="ln">13185 </span></a><span class="s0">(turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I</span>

<a name="l13187"><span class="ln">13187 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me.</span>
<a name="l13188"><span class="ln">13188 </span></a><span class="s0">I am in no hurry.  Adopt her, educate her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13189"><span class="ln">13189 </span></a>
<a name="l13190"><span class="ln">13190 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And make her like myself.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13191"><span class="ln">13191 </span></a>
<a name="l13192"><span class="ln">13192 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;By all means, if you can.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13193"><span class="ln">13193 </span></a>
<a name="l13194"><span class="ln">13194 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very well.  I undertake the commission.  You shall have a charming wife.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13195"><span class="ln">13195 </span></a>
<a name="l13196"><span class="ln">13196 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes.  I care for nothing else.</span>
<a name="l13197"><span class="ln">13197 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return,</span>
<a name="l13198"><span class="ln">13198 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall come to you for my wife.  Remember.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13199"><span class="ln">13199 </span></a>
<a name="l13200"><span class="ln">13200 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was in no danger of forgetting.  It was a commission to touch every</span>
<a name="l13201"><span class="ln">13201 </span></a><span class="s0">favourite feeling.  Would not Harriet be the very creature described?</span>
<a name="l13202"><span class="ln">13202 </span></a><span class="s0">Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.</span>
<a name="l13203"><span class="ln">13203 </span></a><span class="s0">He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment;</span>
<a name="l13204"><span class="ln">13204 </span></a><span class="s0">who could say?  Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.</span>
<a name="l13205"><span class="ln">13205 </span></a>
<a name="l13206"><span class="ln">13206 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Now, ma'am,&quot; said Jane to her aunt, &quot;shall we join Mrs. Elton?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13207"><span class="ln">13207 </span></a>
<a name="l13208"><span class="ln">13208 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If you please, my dear.  With all my heart.  I am quite ready.</span>
<a name="l13209"><span class="ln">13209 </span></a><span class="s0">I was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well.</span>
<a name="l13210"><span class="ln">13210 </span></a><span class="s0">We shall soon overtake her.  There she is--no, that's somebody else.</span>
<a name="l13211"><span class="ln">13211 </span></a><span class="s0">That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--</span>
<a name="l13212"><span class="ln">13212 </span></a><span class="s0">Well, I declare--&quot;</span>
<a name="l13213"><span class="ln">13213 </span></a>
<a name="l13214"><span class="ln">13214 </span></a><span class="s0">They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l13215"><span class="ln">13215 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young</span>
<a name="l13216"><span class="ln">13216 </span></a><span class="s0">man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.  Even Emma grew</span>
<a name="l13217"><span class="ln">13217 </span></a><span class="s0">tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather</span>
<a name="l13218"><span class="ln">13218 </span></a><span class="s0">walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone,</span>
<a name="l13219"><span class="ln">13219 </span></a><span class="s0">and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful</span>
<a name="l13220"><span class="ln">13220 </span></a><span class="s0">views beneath her.  The appearance of the servants looking out</span>
<a name="l13221"><span class="ln">13221 </span></a><span class="s0">for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight;</span>
<a name="l13222"><span class="ln">13222 </span></a><span class="s0">and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart,</span>
<a name="l13223"><span class="ln">13223 </span></a><span class="s0">and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _her_ carriage first,</span>
<a name="l13224"><span class="ln">13224 </span></a><span class="s0">were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was</span>
<a name="l13225"><span class="ln">13225 </span></a><span class="s0">to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure.</span>
<a name="l13226"><span class="ln">13226 </span></a><span class="s0">Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,</span>
<a name="l13227"><span class="ln">13227 </span></a><span class="s0">she hoped never to be betrayed into again.</span>
<a name="l13228"><span class="ln">13228 </span></a>
<a name="l13229"><span class="ln">13229 </span></a><span class="s0">While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side.</span>
<a name="l13230"><span class="ln">13230 </span></a><span class="s0">He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,</span>
<a name="l13231"><span class="ln">13231 </span></a>
<a name="l13232"><span class="ln">13232 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do:</span>
<a name="l13233"><span class="ln">13233 </span></a><span class="s0">a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still</span>
<a name="l13234"><span class="ln">13234 </span></a><span class="s0">use it.  I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance.</span>
<a name="l13235"><span class="ln">13235 </span></a><span class="s0">How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates?  How could you be so</span>
<a name="l13236"><span class="ln">13236 </span></a><span class="s0">insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?--</span>
<a name="l13237"><span class="ln">13237 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma, I had not thought it possible.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13238"><span class="ln">13238 </span></a>
<a name="l13239"><span class="ln">13239 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.</span>
<a name="l13240"><span class="ln">13240 </span></a>
<a name="l13241"><span class="ln">13241 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.</span>
<a name="l13242"><span class="ln">13242 </span></a><span class="s0">It was not so very bad.  I dare say she did not understand me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13243"><span class="ln">13243 </span></a>
<a name="l13244"><span class="ln">13244 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I assure you she did.  She felt your full meaning.  She has talked</span>
<a name="l13245"><span class="ln">13245 </span></a><span class="s0">of it since.  I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--</span>
<a name="l13246"><span class="ln">13246 </span></a><span class="s0">with what candour and generosity.  I wish you could have heard her</span>
<a name="l13247"><span class="ln">13247 </span></a><span class="s0">honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions,</span>
<a name="l13248"><span class="ln">13248 </span></a><span class="s0">as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father,</span>
<a name="l13249"><span class="ln">13249 </span></a><span class="s0">when her society must be so irksome.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13250"><span class="ln">13250 </span></a>
<a name="l13251"><span class="ln">13251 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Emma, &quot;I know there is not a better creature in the world:</span>
<a name="l13252"><span class="ln">13252 </span></a><span class="s0">but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are</span>
<a name="l13253"><span class="ln">13253 </span></a><span class="s0">most unfortunately blended in her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13254"><span class="ln">13254 </span></a>
<a name="l13255"><span class="ln">13255 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;They are blended,&quot; said he, &quot;I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,</span>
<a name="l13256"><span class="ln">13256 </span></a><span class="s0">I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous</span>
<a name="l13257"><span class="ln">13257 </span></a><span class="s0">over the good.  Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every</span>
<a name="l13258"><span class="ln">13258 </span></a><span class="s0">harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you</span>
<a name="l13259"><span class="ln">13259 </span></a><span class="s0">for any liberties of manner.  Were she your equal in situation--</span>
<a name="l13260"><span class="ln">13260 </span></a><span class="s0">but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case.  She is poor;</span>
<a name="l13261"><span class="ln">13261 </span></a><span class="s0">she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live</span>
<a name="l13262"><span class="ln">13262 </span></a><span class="s0">to old age, must probably sink more.  Her situation should secure</span>
<a name="l13263"><span class="ln">13263 </span></a><span class="s0">your compassion.  It was badly done, indeed!  You, whom she had known</span>
<a name="l13264"><span class="ln">13264 </span></a><span class="s0">from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her</span>
<a name="l13265"><span class="ln">13265 </span></a><span class="s0">notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits,</span>
<a name="l13266"><span class="ln">13266 </span></a><span class="s0">and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her--and before</span>
<a name="l13267"><span class="ln">13267 </span></a><span class="s0">her niece, too--and before others, many of whom (certainly _some_,)</span>
<a name="l13268"><span class="ln">13268 </span></a><span class="s0">would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her.--This is not</span>
<a name="l13269"><span class="ln">13269 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from pleasant to me;</span>
<a name="l13270"><span class="ln">13270 </span></a><span class="s0">but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;</span>
<a name="l13271"><span class="ln">13271 </span></a><span class="s0">satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel,</span>
<a name="l13272"><span class="ln">13272 </span></a><span class="s0">and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice</span>
<a name="l13273"><span class="ln">13273 </span></a><span class="s0">than you can do now.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13274"><span class="ln">13274 </span></a>
<a name="l13275"><span class="ln">13275 </span></a><span class="s0">While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage;</span>
<a name="l13276"><span class="ln">13276 </span></a><span class="s0">it was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in.</span>
<a name="l13277"><span class="ln">13277 </span></a><span class="s0">He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted,</span>
<a name="l13278"><span class="ln">13278 </span></a><span class="s0">and her tongue motionless.  They were combined only of anger</span>
<a name="l13279"><span class="ln">13279 </span></a><span class="s0">against herself, mortification, and deep concern.  She had not</span>
<a name="l13280"><span class="ln">13280 </span></a><span class="s0">been able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back</span>
<a name="l13281"><span class="ln">13281 </span></a><span class="s0">for a moment overcome--then reproaching herself for having taken</span>
<a name="l13282"><span class="ln">13282 </span></a><span class="s0">no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness,</span>
<a name="l13283"><span class="ln">13283 </span></a><span class="s0">she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference;</span>
<a name="l13284"><span class="ln">13284 </span></a><span class="s0">but it was just too late.  He had turned away, and the horses were</span>
<a name="l13285"><span class="ln">13285 </span></a><span class="s0">in motion.  She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon,</span>
<a name="l13286"><span class="ln">13286 </span></a><span class="s0">with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill,</span>
<a name="l13287"><span class="ln">13287 </span></a><span class="s0">and every thing left far behind.  She was vexed beyond what could</span>
<a name="l13288"><span class="ln">13288 </span></a><span class="s0">have been expressed--almost beyond what she could conceal.</span>
<a name="l13289"><span class="ln">13289 </span></a><span class="s0">Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance</span>
<a name="l13290"><span class="ln">13290 </span></a><span class="s0">in her life.  She was most forcibly struck.  The truth of this</span>
<a name="l13291"><span class="ln">13291 </span></a><span class="s0">representation there was no denying.  She felt it at her heart.</span>
<a name="l13292"><span class="ln">13292 </span></a><span class="s0">How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates!  How could</span>
<a name="l13293"><span class="ln">13293 </span></a><span class="s0">she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued!</span>
<a name="l13294"><span class="ln">13294 </span></a><span class="s0">And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude,</span>
<a name="l13295"><span class="ln">13295 </span></a><span class="s0">of concurrence, of common kindness!</span>
<a name="l13296"><span class="ln">13296 </span></a>
<a name="l13297"><span class="ln">13297 </span></a><span class="s0">Time did not compose her.  As she reflected more, she seemed</span>
<a name="l13298"><span class="ln">13298 </span></a><span class="s0">but to feel it more.  She never had been so depressed.  Happily it</span>
<a name="l13299"><span class="ln">13299 </span></a><span class="s0">was not necessary to speak.  There was only Harriet, who seemed not</span>
<a name="l13300"><span class="ln">13300 </span></a><span class="s0">in spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma</span>
<a name="l13301"><span class="ln">13301 </span></a><span class="s0">felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home,</span>
<a name="l13302"><span class="ln">13302 </span></a><span class="s0">without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.</span>
<a name="l13303"><span class="ln">13303 </span></a>
<a name="l13304"><span class="ln">13304 </span></a>

<a name="l13308"><span class="ln">13308 </span></a>
<a name="l13309"><span class="ln">13309 </span></a><span class="s0">The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all</span>
<a name="l13310"><span class="ln">13310 </span></a><span class="s0">the evening.  How it might be considered by the rest of the party,</span>
<a name="l13311"><span class="ln">13311 </span></a><span class="s0">she could not tell.  They, in their different homes, and their different</span>
<a name="l13312"><span class="ln">13312 </span></a><span class="s0">ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it</span>
<a name="l13313"><span class="ln">13313 </span></a><span class="s0">was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational</span>
<a name="l13314"><span class="ln">13314 </span></a><span class="s0">satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection,</span>
<a name="l13315"><span class="ln">13315 </span></a><span class="s0">than any she had ever passed.  A whole evening of back-gammon with</span>
<a name="l13316"><span class="ln">13316 </span></a><span class="s0">her father, was felicity to it.  _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure,</span>
<a name="l13317"><span class="ln">13317 </span></a><span class="s0">for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four</span>
<a name="l13318"><span class="ln">13318 </span></a><span class="s0">to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree</span>
<a name="l13319"><span class="ln">13319 </span></a><span class="s0">of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her</span>
<a name="l13320"><span class="ln">13320 </span></a><span class="s0">general conduct, be open to any severe reproach.  As a daughter,</span>
<a name="l13321"><span class="ln">13321 </span></a><span class="s0">she hoped she was not without a heart.  She hoped no one could</span>
<a name="l13322"><span class="ln">13322 </span></a><span class="s0">have said to her, &quot;How could you be so unfeeling to your father?--</span>
<a name="l13323"><span class="ln">13323 </span></a><span class="s0">I must, I will tell you truths while I can.&quot;  Miss Bates should</span>
<a name="l13324"><span class="ln">13324 </span></a><span class="s0">never again--no, never!  If attention, in future, could do away</span>
<a name="l13325"><span class="ln">13325 </span></a><span class="s0">the past, she might hope to be forgiven.  She had been often remiss,</span>
<a name="l13326"><span class="ln">13326 </span></a><span class="s0">her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought</span>
<a name="l13327"><span class="ln">13327 </span></a><span class="s0">than fact; scornful, ungracious.  But it should be so no more.</span>
<a name="l13328"><span class="ln">13328 </span></a><span class="s0">In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the</span>
<a name="l13329"><span class="ln">13329 </span></a><span class="s0">very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side,</span>
<a name="l13330"><span class="ln">13330 </span></a><span class="s0">of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.</span>
<a name="l13331"><span class="ln">13331 </span></a>
<a name="l13332"><span class="ln">13332 </span></a><span class="s0">She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,</span>
<a name="l13333"><span class="ln">13333 </span></a><span class="s0">that nothing might prevent her.  It was not unlikely, she thought,</span>
<a name="l13334"><span class="ln">13334 </span></a><span class="s0">that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might</span>
<a name="l13335"><span class="ln">13335 </span></a><span class="s0">come in while she were paying her visit.  She had no objection.</span>
<a name="l13336"><span class="ln">13336 </span></a><span class="s0">She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly</span>
<a name="l13337"><span class="ln">13337 </span></a><span class="s0">and truly hers.  Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she</span>
<a name="l13338"><span class="ln">13338 </span></a><span class="s0">saw him not.</span>
<a name="l13339"><span class="ln">13339 </span></a>
<a name="l13340"><span class="ln">13340 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The ladies were all at home.&quot;  She had never rejoiced at the sound</span>
<a name="l13341"><span class="ln">13341 </span></a><span class="s0">before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,</span>
<a name="l13342"><span class="ln">13342 </span></a><span class="s0">with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation,</span>
<a name="l13343"><span class="ln">13343 </span></a><span class="s0">or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.</span>
<a name="l13344"><span class="ln">13344 </span></a>
<a name="l13345"><span class="ln">13345 </span></a><span class="s0">There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.</span>
<a name="l13346"><span class="ln">13346 </span></a><span class="s0">She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry;</span>
<a name="l13347"><span class="ln">13347 </span></a><span class="s0">the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased</span>
<a name="l13348"><span class="ln">13348 </span></a><span class="s0">to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon.  The aunt and</span>
<a name="l13349"><span class="ln">13349 </span></a><span class="s0">niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room.  Jane she had</span>
<a name="l13350"><span class="ln">13350 </span></a><span class="s0">a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door</span>
<a name="l13351"><span class="ln">13351 </span></a><span class="s0">had shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, &quot;Well, my dear,</span>
<a name="l13352"><span class="ln">13352 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are</span>
<a name="l13353"><span class="ln">13353 </span></a><span class="s0">ill enough.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13354"><span class="ln">13354 </span></a>
<a name="l13355"><span class="ln">13355 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she</span>
<a name="l13356"><span class="ln">13356 </span></a><span class="s0">did not quite understand what was going on.</span>
<a name="l13357"><span class="ln">13357 </span></a>
<a name="l13358"><span class="ln">13358 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am afraid Jane is not very well,&quot; said she, &quot;but I do not know;</span>
<a name="l13359"><span class="ln">13359 </span></a><span class="s0">they _tell_ me she is well.  I dare say my daughter will be here presently,</span>
<a name="l13360"><span class="ln">13360 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse.  I hope you find a chair.  I wish Hetty had not gone.</span>
<a name="l13361"><span class="ln">13361 </span></a><span class="s0">I am very little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where</span>
<a name="l13362"><span class="ln">13362 </span></a><span class="s0">you like?  I am sure she will be here presently.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13363"><span class="ln">13363 </span></a>
<a name="l13364"><span class="ln">13364 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma seriously hoped she would.  She had a moment's fear of Miss</span>
<a name="l13365"><span class="ln">13365 </span></a><span class="s0">Bates keeping away from her.  But Miss Bates soon came--&quot;Very happy</span>
<a name="l13366"><span class="ln">13366 </span></a><span class="s0">and obliged&quot;--but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the</span>
<a name="l13367"><span class="ln">13367 </span></a><span class="s0">same cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner.</span>
<a name="l13368"><span class="ln">13368 </span></a><span class="s0">A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead</span>
<a name="l13369"><span class="ln">13369 </span></a><span class="s0">the way to a return of old feelings.  The touch seemed immediate.</span>
<a name="l13370"><span class="ln">13370 </span></a>
<a name="l13371"><span class="ln">13371 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!  Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--</span>
<a name="l13372"><span class="ln">13372 </span></a><span class="s0">and are come to give us joy.  This does not seem much like joy,</span>
<a name="l13373"><span class="ln">13373 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed, in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be</span>
<a name="l13374"><span class="ln">13374 </span></a><span class="s0">very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long,</span>
<a name="l13375"><span class="ln">13375 </span></a><span class="s0">and she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:--</span>
<a name="l13376"><span class="ln">13376 </span></a><span class="s0">such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell,</span>
<a name="l13377"><span class="ln">13377 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mrs. Dixon.  `My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself'--</span>
<a name="l13378"><span class="ln">13378 </span></a><span class="s0">for tears were in her eyes perpetually.  One cannot wonder,</span>
<a name="l13379"><span class="ln">13379 </span></a><span class="s0">one cannot wonder.  It is a great change; and though she is</span>
<a name="l13380"><span class="ln">13380 </span></a><span class="s0">amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman</span>
<a name="l13381"><span class="ln">13381 </span></a><span class="s0">before ever met with on first going out--do not think us ungrateful,</span>
<a name="l13382"><span class="ln">13382 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing</span>
<a name="l13383"><span class="ln">13383 </span></a><span class="s0">her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache</span>
<a name="l13384"><span class="ln">13384 </span></a><span class="s0">she has.  When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel</span>
<a name="l13385"><span class="ln">13385 </span></a><span class="s0">any blessing quite as it may deserve.  She is as low as possible.</span>
<a name="l13386"><span class="ln">13386 </span></a><span class="s0">To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she</span>
<a name="l13387"><span class="ln">13387 </span></a><span class="s0">is to have secured such a situation.  You will excuse her not</span>
<a name="l13388"><span class="ln">13388 </span></a><span class="s0">coming to you--she is not able--she is gone into her own room--</span>
<a name="l13389"><span class="ln">13389 </span></a><span class="s0">I want her to lie down upon the bed.  `My dear,' said I, `I shall</span>
<a name="l13390"><span class="ln">13390 </span></a><span class="s0">say you are laid down upon the bed:'  but, however, she is not;</span>
<a name="l13391"><span class="ln">13391 </span></a><span class="s0">she is walking about the room.  But, now that she has written</span>
<a name="l13392"><span class="ln">13392 </span></a><span class="s0">her letters, she says she shall soon be well.  She will be extremely</span>
<a name="l13393"><span class="ln">13393 </span></a><span class="s0">sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will</span>
<a name="l13394"><span class="ln">13394 </span></a><span class="s0">excuse her.  You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite ashamed--</span>
<a name="l13395"><span class="ln">13395 </span></a><span class="s0">but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that we</span>
<a name="l13396"><span class="ln">13396 </span></a><span class="s0">had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did</span>
<a name="l13397"><span class="ln">13397 </span></a><span class="s0">not know any body was coming.  `It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I,</span>
<a name="l13398"><span class="ln">13398 </span></a><span class="s0">`depend upon it.  Nobody else would come so early.'  `Well,' said she,</span>
<a name="l13399"><span class="ln">13399 </span></a><span class="s0">`it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.'</span>
<a name="l13400"><span class="ln">13400 </span></a><span class="s0">But then Patty came in, and said it was you.  `Oh!' said I,</span>
<a name="l13401"><span class="ln">13401 </span></a><span class="s0">`it is Miss Woodhouse:  I am sure you will like to see her.'--</span>
<a name="l13402"><span class="ln">13402 </span></a><span class="s0">`I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away;</span>
<a name="l13403"><span class="ln">13403 </span></a><span class="s0">and that was what made us keep you waiting--and extremely sorry</span>
<a name="l13404"><span class="ln">13404 </span></a><span class="s0">and ashamed we were.  `If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must,</span>
<a name="l13405"><span class="ln">13405 </span></a><span class="s0">and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'&quot;</span>
<a name="l13406"><span class="ln">13406 </span></a>
<a name="l13407"><span class="ln">13407 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was most sincerely interested.  Her heart had been long growing</span>
<a name="l13408"><span class="ln">13408 </span></a><span class="s0">kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted</span>
<a name="l13409"><span class="ln">13409 </span></a><span class="s0">as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing</span>
<a name="l13410"><span class="ln">13410 </span></a><span class="s0">but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle</span>
<a name="l13411"><span class="ln">13411 </span></a><span class="s0">sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very</span>
<a name="l13412"><span class="ln">13412 </span></a><span class="s0">naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend,</span>
<a name="l13413"><span class="ln">13413 </span></a><span class="s0">when she might not bear to see herself.  She spoke as she felt,</span>
<a name="l13414"><span class="ln">13414 </span></a><span class="s0">with earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the</span>
<a name="l13415"><span class="ln">13415 </span></a><span class="s0">circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually</span>
<a name="l13416"><span class="ln">13416 </span></a><span class="s0">determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage</span>
<a name="l13417"><span class="ln">13417 </span></a><span class="s0">and comfort as possible.  &quot;It must be a severe trial to them all.</span>
<a name="l13418"><span class="ln">13418 </span></a><span class="s0">She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13419"><span class="ln">13419 </span></a>
<a name="l13420"><span class="ln">13420 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So very kind!&quot; replied Miss Bates.  &quot;But you are always kind.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13421"><span class="ln">13421 </span></a>
<a name="l13422"><span class="ln">13422 </span></a><span class="s0">There was no bearing such an &quot;always;&quot; and to break through her</span>
<a name="l13423"><span class="ln">13423 </span></a><span class="s0">dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--</span>
<a name="l13424"><span class="ln">13424 </span></a>
<a name="l13425"><span class="ln">13425 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13426"><span class="ln">13426 </span></a>
<a name="l13427"><span class="ln">13427 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have</span>
<a name="l13428"><span class="ln">13428 </span></a><span class="s0">the charge of her three little girls--delightful children.</span>
<a name="l13429"><span class="ln">13429 </span></a><span class="s0">Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort;</span>
<a name="l13430"><span class="ln">13430 </span></a><span class="s0">if we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's;</span>
<a name="l13431"><span class="ln">13431 </span></a><span class="s0">but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very</span>
<a name="l13432"><span class="ln">13432 </span></a><span class="s0">same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove.</span>
<a name="l13433"><span class="ln">13433 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13434"><span class="ln">13434 </span></a>
<a name="l13435"><span class="ln">13435 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--&quot;</span>
<a name="l13436"><span class="ln">13436 </span></a>
<a name="l13437"><span class="ln">13437 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, our good Mrs. Elton.  The most indefatigable, true friend.</span>
<a name="l13438"><span class="ln">13438 </span></a><span class="s0">She would not take a denial.  She would not let Jane say, `No;' for</span>
<a name="l13439"><span class="ln">13439 </span></a><span class="s0">when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday,</span>
<a name="l13440"><span class="ln">13440 </span></a><span class="s0">the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it,</span>
<a name="l13441"><span class="ln">13441 </span></a><span class="s0">she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the</span>
<a name="l13442"><span class="ln">13442 </span></a><span class="s0">reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind</span>
<a name="l13443"><span class="ln">13443 </span></a><span class="s0">to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing</span>
<a name="l13444"><span class="ln">13444 </span></a><span class="s0">should induce her to enter into any engagement at present--and so she</span>
<a name="l13445"><span class="ln">13445 </span></a><span class="s0">told Mrs. Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more</span>
<a name="l13446"><span class="ln">13446 </span></a><span class="s0">idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton,</span>
<a name="l13447"><span class="ln">13447 </span></a><span class="s0">whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did.  It is not</span>
<a name="l13448"><span class="ln">13448 </span></a><span class="s0">every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did,</span>
<a name="l13449"><span class="ln">13449 </span></a><span class="s0">and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she</span>
<a name="l13450"><span class="ln">13450 </span></a><span class="s0">would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her;</span>
<a name="l13451"><span class="ln">13451 </span></a><span class="s0">she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all</span>
<a name="l13452"><span class="ln">13452 </span></a><span class="s0">settled that Jane should go.  Quite a surprize to me!  I had not</span>
<a name="l13453"><span class="ln">13453 </span></a><span class="s0">the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once,</span>
<a name="l13454"><span class="ln">13454 </span></a><span class="s0">that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation,</span>
<a name="l13455"><span class="ln">13455 </span></a><span class="s0">she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word</span>
<a name="l13456"><span class="ln">13456 </span></a><span class="s0">of it till it was all settled.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13457"><span class="ln">13457 </span></a>
<a name="l13458"><span class="ln">13458 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13459"><span class="ln">13459 </span></a>
<a name="l13460"><span class="ln">13460 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come.  It was settled so,</span>
<a name="l13461"><span class="ln">13461 </span></a><span class="s0">upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l13462"><span class="ln">13462 </span></a><span class="s0">`You _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us,' said she--`I positively must</span>
<a name="l13463"><span class="ln">13463 </span></a><span class="s0">have you _all_ come.'&quot;</span>
<a name="l13464"><span class="ln">13464 </span></a>
<a name="l13465"><span class="ln">13465 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13466"><span class="ln">13466 </span></a>
<a name="l13467"><span class="ln">13467 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I</span>
<a name="l13468"><span class="ln">13468 </span></a><span class="s0">thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let</span>
<a name="l13469"><span class="ln">13469 </span></a><span class="s0">him off, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,</span>
<a name="l13470"><span class="ln">13470 </span></a><span class="s0">and a very agreeable evening we had.  Such kind friends, you know,</span>
<a name="l13471"><span class="ln">13471 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body</span>
<a name="l13472"><span class="ln">13472 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.  Even pleasure,</span>
<a name="l13473"><span class="ln">13473 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed</span>
<a name="l13474"><span class="ln">13474 </span></a><span class="s0">very much to have enjoyed it.  However, _I_ shall always think it</span>
<a name="l13475"><span class="ln">13475 </span></a><span class="s0">a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends</span>
<a name="l13476"><span class="ln">13476 </span></a><span class="s0">who included me in it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13477"><span class="ln">13477 </span></a>
<a name="l13478"><span class="ln">13478 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been</span>
<a name="l13479"><span class="ln">13479 </span></a><span class="s0">making up her mind the whole day?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13480"><span class="ln">13480 </span></a>
<a name="l13481"><span class="ln">13481 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I dare say she had.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13482"><span class="ln">13482 </span></a>
<a name="l13483"><span class="ln">13483 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all</span>
<a name="l13484"><span class="ln">13484 </span></a><span class="s0">her friends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation</span>
<a name="l13485"><span class="ln">13485 </span></a><span class="s0">that is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13486"><span class="ln">13486 </span></a>
<a name="l13487"><span class="ln">13487 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse.  Yes, indeed, there is every thing</span>
<a name="l13488"><span class="ln">13488 </span></a><span class="s0">in the world that can make her happy in it.  Except the Sucklings</span>
<a name="l13489"><span class="ln">13489 </span></a><span class="s0">and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment,</span>
<a name="l13490"><span class="ln">13490 </span></a><span class="s0">so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance.</span>
<a name="l13491"><span class="ln">13491 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost</span>
<a name="l13492"><span class="ln">13492 </span></a><span class="s0">equal to Maple Grove--and as to the children, except the little</span>
<a name="l13493"><span class="ln">13493 </span></a><span class="s0">Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet</span>
<a name="l13494"><span class="ln">13494 </span></a><span class="s0">children anywhere.  Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!--</span>
<a name="l13495"><span class="ln">13495 </span></a><span class="s0">It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.--And her salary!--</span>
<a name="l13496"><span class="ln">13496 </span></a><span class="s0">I really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse.</span>
<a name="l13497"><span class="ln">13497 </span></a><span class="s0">Even you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that</span>
<a name="l13498"><span class="ln">13498 </span></a><span class="s0">so much could be given to a young person like Jane.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13499"><span class="ln">13499 </span></a>
<a name="l13500"><span class="ln">13500 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! madam,&quot; cried Emma, &quot;if other children are at all like what I</span>
<a name="l13501"><span class="ln">13501 </span></a><span class="s0">remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount</span>
<a name="l13502"><span class="ln">13502 </span></a><span class="s0">of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions,</span>
<a name="l13503"><span class="ln">13503 </span></a><span class="s0">dearly earned.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13504"><span class="ln">13504 </span></a>
<a name="l13505"><span class="ln">13505 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are so noble in your ideas!&quot;</span>
<a name="l13506"><span class="ln">13506 </span></a>
<a name="l13507"><span class="ln">13507 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13508"><span class="ln">13508 </span></a>
<a name="l13509"><span class="ln">13509 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it.</span>
<a name="l13510"><span class="ln">13510 </span></a><span class="s0">Within a fortnight.  Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry.  My poor</span>
<a name="l13511"><span class="ln">13511 </span></a><span class="s0">mother does not know how to bear it.  So then, I try to put it out of</span>
<a name="l13512"><span class="ln">13512 </span></a><span class="s0">her thoughts, and say, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13513"><span class="ln">13513 </span></a>
<a name="l13514"><span class="ln">13514 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel</span>
<a name="l13515"><span class="ln">13515 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself</span>
<a name="l13516"><span class="ln">13516 </span></a><span class="s0">before their return?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13517"><span class="ln">13517 </span></a>
<a name="l13518"><span class="ln">13518 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such</span>
<a name="l13519"><span class="ln">13519 </span></a><span class="s0">a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining.</span>
<a name="l13520"><span class="ln">13520 </span></a><span class="s0">I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying</span>
<a name="l13521"><span class="ln">13521 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating</span>
<a name="l13522"><span class="ln">13522 </span></a><span class="s0">me upon it!  It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea,</span>
<a name="l13523"><span class="ln">13523 </span></a><span class="s0">because we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea,</span>
<a name="l13524"><span class="ln">13524 </span></a><span class="s0">because I remember thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it;</span>
<a name="l13525"><span class="ln">13525 </span></a><span class="s0">something happened before tea, but not that.  Mr. Elton was called</span>
<a name="l13526"><span class="ln">13526 </span></a><span class="s0">out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak</span>
<a name="l13527"><span class="ln">13527 </span></a><span class="s0">with him.  Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk</span>
<a name="l13528"><span class="ln">13528 </span></a><span class="s0">to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is</span>
<a name="l13529"><span class="ln">13529 </span></a><span class="s0">bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints--</span>
<a name="l13530"><span class="ln">13530 </span></a><span class="s0">I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she</span>
<a name="l13531"><span class="ln">13531 </span></a><span class="s0">gets out at all.  And poor John's son came to talk to Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l13532"><span class="ln">13532 </span></a><span class="s0">about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself,</span>
<a name="l13533"><span class="ln">13533 </span></a><span class="s0">you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing</span>
<a name="l13534"><span class="ln">13534 </span></a><span class="s0">of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;</span>
<a name="l13535"><span class="ln">13535 </span></a><span class="s0">and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler</span>
<a name="l13536"><span class="ln">13536 </span></a><span class="s0">had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having</span>
<a name="l13537"><span class="ln">13537 </span></a><span class="s0">been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond.</span>
<a name="l13538"><span class="ln">13538 </span></a><span class="s0">That was what happened before tea.  It was after tea that Jane spoke</span>
<a name="l13539"><span class="ln">13539 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mrs. Elton.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13540"><span class="ln">13540 </span></a>
<a name="l13541"><span class="ln">13541 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly</span>
<a name="l13542"><span class="ln">13542 </span></a><span class="s0">new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it</span>
<a name="l13543"><span class="ln">13543 </span></a><span class="s0">possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars</span>
<a name="l13544"><span class="ln">13544 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Frank Churchill's going, she proceeded to give them all,</span>
<a name="l13545"><span class="ln">13545 </span></a><span class="s0">it was of no consequence.</span>
<a name="l13546"><span class="ln">13546 </span></a>
<a name="l13547"><span class="ln">13547 </span></a><span class="s0">What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the</span>
<a name="l13548"><span class="ln">13548 </span></a><span class="s0">accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge</span>
<a name="l13549"><span class="ln">13549 </span></a><span class="s0">of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over</span>
<a name="l13550"><span class="ln">13550 </span></a><span class="s0">from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--</span>
<a name="l13551"><span class="ln">13551 </span></a><span class="s0">which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected;</span>
<a name="l13552"><span class="ln">13552 </span></a><span class="s0">and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing,</span>
<a name="l13553"><span class="ln">13553 </span></a><span class="s0">upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only</span>
<a name="l13554"><span class="ln">13554 </span></a><span class="s0">wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early;</span>
<a name="l13555"><span class="ln">13555 </span></a><span class="s0">but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly,</span>
<a name="l13556"><span class="ln">13556 </span></a><span class="s0">without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold,</span>
<a name="l13557"><span class="ln">13557 </span></a><span class="s0">Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the</span>
<a name="l13558"><span class="ln">13558 </span></a><span class="s0">ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace,</span>
<a name="l13559"><span class="ln">13559 </span></a><span class="s0">and driving very steady.</span>
<a name="l13560"><span class="ln">13560 </span></a>
<a name="l13561"><span class="ln">13561 </span></a><span class="s0">There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest,</span>
<a name="l13562"><span class="ln">13562 </span></a><span class="s0">and it caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject</span>
<a name="l13563"><span class="ln">13563 </span></a><span class="s0">which already engaged her mind.  The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's</span>
<a name="l13564"><span class="ln">13564 </span></a><span class="s0">importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was</span>
<a name="l13565"><span class="ln">13565 </span></a><span class="s0">every thing, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference</span>
<a name="l13566"><span class="ln">13566 </span></a><span class="s0">of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,</span>
<a name="l13567"><span class="ln">13567 </span></a><span class="s0">till roused by Miss Bates's saying,</span>
<a name="l13568"><span class="ln">13568 </span></a>
<a name="l13569"><span class="ln">13569 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte.  What is to become</span>
<a name="l13570"><span class="ln">13570 </span></a><span class="s0">of that?--Very true.  Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--</span>
<a name="l13571"><span class="ln">13571 </span></a><span class="s0">`You must go,' said she.  `You and I must part.  You will have no</span>
<a name="l13572"><span class="ln">13572 </span></a><span class="s0">business here.--Let it stay, however,' said she; `give it houseroom</span>
<a name="l13573"><span class="ln">13573 </span></a><span class="s0">till Colonel Campbell comes back.  I shall talk about it to him;</span>
<a name="l13574"><span class="ln">13574 </span></a><span class="s0">he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'--</span>
<a name="l13575"><span class="ln">13575 </span></a><span class="s0">And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his</span>
<a name="l13576"><span class="ln">13576 </span></a><span class="s0">present or his daughter's.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13577"><span class="ln">13577 </span></a>
<a name="l13578"><span class="ln">13578 </span></a><span class="s0">Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance</span>
<a name="l13579"><span class="ln">13579 </span></a><span class="s0">of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,</span>
<a name="l13580"><span class="ln">13580 </span></a><span class="s0">that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been</span>
<a name="l13581"><span class="ln">13581 </span></a><span class="s0">long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could</span>
<a name="l13582"><span class="ln">13582 </span></a><span class="s0">venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.</span>
<a name="l13583"><span class="ln">13583 </span></a>
<a name="l13584"><span class="ln">13584 </span></a>
<a name="l13585"><span class="ln">13585 </span></a>
<a name="l13586"><span class="ln">13586 </span></a><span class="s0">CHAPTER IX</span>
<a name="l13587"><span class="ln">13587 </span></a>
<a name="l13588"><span class="ln">13588 </span></a>
<a name="l13589"><span class="ln">13589 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;</span>
<a name="l13590"><span class="ln">13590 </span></a><span class="s0">but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her.</span>
<a name="l13591"><span class="ln">13591 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were</span>
<a name="l13592"><span class="ln">13592 </span></a><span class="s0">sitting with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a</span>
<a name="l13593"><span class="ln">13593 </span></a><span class="s0">manner decidedly graver than usual, said,</span>
<a name="l13594"><span class="ln">13594 </span></a>
<a name="l13595"><span class="ln">13595 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,</span>
<a name="l13596"><span class="ln">13596 </span></a><span class="s0">and therefore must now be gone directly.  I am going to London,</span>
<a name="l13597"><span class="ln">13597 </span></a><span class="s0">to spend a few days with John and Isabella.  Have you any thing to</span>
<a name="l13598"><span class="ln">13598 </span></a><span class="s0">send or say, besides the `love,' which nobody carries?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13599"><span class="ln">13599 </span></a>
<a name="l13600"><span class="ln">13600 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nothing at all.  But is not this a sudden scheme?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13601"><span class="ln">13601 </span></a>
<a name="l13602"><span class="ln">13602 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13603"><span class="ln">13603 </span></a>
<a name="l13604"><span class="ln">13604 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.</span>
<a name="l13605"><span class="ln">13605 </span></a><span class="s0">Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be</span>
<a name="l13606"><span class="ln">13606 </span></a><span class="s0">friends again.  While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--</span>
<a name="l13607"><span class="ln">13607 </span></a><span class="s0">her father began his inquiries.</span>
<a name="l13608"><span class="ln">13608 </span></a>
<a name="l13609"><span class="ln">13609 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you</span>
<a name="l13610"><span class="ln">13610 </span></a><span class="s0">find my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must</span>
<a name="l13611"><span class="ln">13611 </span></a><span class="s0">have been very much obliged to you for coming.  Dear Emma has been</span>
<a name="l13612"><span class="ln">13612 </span></a><span class="s0">to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before.</span>
<a name="l13613"><span class="ln">13613 </span></a><span class="s0">She is always so attentive to them!&quot;</span>
<a name="l13614"><span class="ln">13614 </span></a>
<a name="l13615"><span class="ln">13615 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,</span>
<a name="l13616"><span class="ln">13616 </span></a><span class="s0">and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.--</span>
<a name="l13617"><span class="ln">13617 </span></a><span class="s0">It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour,</span>
<a name="l13618"><span class="ln">13618 </span></a><span class="s0">as if his eyes received the truth from her's, and all that had</span>
<a name="l13619"><span class="ln">13619 </span></a><span class="s0">passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--</span>
<a name="l13620"><span class="ln">13620 </span></a><span class="s0">He looked at her with a glow of regard.  She was warmly gratified--</span>
<a name="l13621"><span class="ln">13621 </span></a><span class="s0">and in another moment still more so, by a little movement of</span>
<a name="l13622"><span class="ln">13622 </span></a><span class="s0">more than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--</span>
<a name="l13623"><span class="ln">13623 </span></a><span class="s0">whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not say--</span>
<a name="l13624"><span class="ln">13624 </span></a><span class="s0">she might, perhaps, have rather offered it--but he took her hand,</span>
<a name="l13625"><span class="ln">13625 </span></a><span class="s0">pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips--</span>
<a name="l13626"><span class="ln">13626 </span></a><span class="s0">when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel</span>
<a name="l13627"><span class="ln">13627 </span></a><span class="s0">such a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done,</span>
<a name="l13628"><span class="ln">13628 </span></a><span class="s0">she could not perceive.--He would have judged better, she thought,</span>
<a name="l13629"><span class="ln">13629 </span></a><span class="s0">if he had not stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable;</span>
<a name="l13630"><span class="ln">13630 </span></a><span class="s0">and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry,</span>
<a name="l13631"><span class="ln">13631 </span></a><span class="s0">or however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.--</span>
<a name="l13632"><span class="ln">13632 </span></a><span class="s0">It was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--</span>
<a name="l13633"><span class="ln">13633 </span></a><span class="s0">She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction.</span>
<a name="l13634"><span class="ln">13634 </span></a><span class="s0">It spoke such perfect amity.--He left them immediately afterwards--</span>
<a name="l13635"><span class="ln">13635 </span></a><span class="s0">gone in a moment.  He always moved with the alertness of a mind which</span>
<a name="l13636"><span class="ln">13636 </span></a><span class="s0">could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden</span>
<a name="l13637"><span class="ln">13637 </span></a><span class="s0">than usual in his disappearance.</span>
<a name="l13638"><span class="ln">13638 </span></a>
<a name="l13639"><span class="ln">13639 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished</span>
<a name="l13640"><span class="ln">13640 </span></a><span class="s0">she had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great</span>
<a name="l13641"><span class="ln">13641 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--</span>
<a name="l13642"><span class="ln">13642 </span></a><span class="s0">Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square,</span>
<a name="l13643"><span class="ln">13643 </span></a><span class="s0">for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have</span>
<a name="l13644"><span class="ln">13644 </span></a><span class="s0">happened at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it,</span>
<a name="l13645"><span class="ln">13645 </span></a><span class="s0">would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however;</span>
<a name="l13646"><span class="ln">13646 </span></a><span class="s0">she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance,</span>
<a name="l13647"><span class="ln">13647 </span></a><span class="s0">and his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she</span>
<a name="l13648"><span class="ln">13648 </span></a><span class="s0">had fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them</span>
<a name="l13649"><span class="ln">13649 </span></a><span class="s0">half an hour, she found.  It was a pity that she had not come</span>
<a name="l13650"><span class="ln">13650 </span></a><span class="s0">back earlier!</span>
<a name="l13651"><span class="ln">13651 </span></a>
<a name="l13652"><span class="ln">13652 </span></a><span class="s0">In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness</span>
<a name="l13653"><span class="ln">13653 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly;</span>
<a name="l13654"><span class="ln">13654 </span></a><span class="s0">and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;</span>
<a name="l13655"><span class="ln">13655 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence</span>
<a name="l13656"><span class="ln">13656 </span></a><span class="s0">on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,--</span>
<a name="l13657"><span class="ln">13657 </span></a><span class="s0">interested, without disturbing him.  He had long made up his mind to Jane</span>
<a name="l13658"><span class="ln">13658 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully,</span>
<a name="l13659"><span class="ln">13659 </span></a><span class="s0">but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.</span>
<a name="l13660"><span class="ln">13660 </span></a>
<a name="l13661"><span class="ln">13661 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so</span>
<a name="l13662"><span class="ln">13662 </span></a><span class="s0">comfortably settled.  Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable,</span>
<a name="l13663"><span class="ln">13663 </span></a><span class="s0">and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought</span>
<a name="l13664"><span class="ln">13664 </span></a><span class="s0">to be.  I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health</span>
<a name="l13665"><span class="ln">13665 </span></a><span class="s0">will be taken good care of.  It ought to be a first object,</span>
<a name="l13666"><span class="ln">13666 </span></a><span class="s0">as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.  You know,</span>
<a name="l13667"><span class="ln">13667 </span></a><span class="s0">my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor</span>
<a name="l13668"><span class="ln">13668 </span></a><span class="s0">was to us.  And I hope she will be better off in one respect,</span>
<a name="l13669"><span class="ln">13669 </span></a><span class="s0">and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13670"><span class="ln">13670 </span></a>
<a name="l13671"><span class="ln">13671 </span></a><span class="s0">The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every</span>
<a name="l13672"><span class="ln">13672 </span></a><span class="s0">thing else into the background.  An express arrived at Randalls</span>
<a name="l13673"><span class="ln">13673 </span></a><span class="s0">to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill!  Though her nephew</span>
<a name="l13674"><span class="ln">13674 </span></a><span class="s0">had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account,</span>
<a name="l13675"><span class="ln">13675 </span></a><span class="s0">she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return.</span>
<a name="l13676"><span class="ln">13676 </span></a><span class="s0">A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded</span>
<a name="l13677"><span class="ln">13677 </span></a><span class="s0">by her general state, had carried her off after a short struggle.</span>
<a name="l13678"><span class="ln">13678 </span></a><span class="s0">The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.</span>
<a name="l13679"><span class="ln">13679 </span></a>
<a name="l13680"><span class="ln">13680 </span></a><span class="s0">It was felt as such things must be felt.  Every body had a</span>
<a name="l13681"><span class="ln">13681 </span></a><span class="s0">degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed,</span>
<a name="l13682"><span class="ln">13682 </span></a><span class="s0">solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time,</span>
<a name="l13683"><span class="ln">13683 </span></a><span class="s0">curiosity to know where she would be buried.  Goldsmith tells us,</span>
<a name="l13684"><span class="ln">13684 </span></a><span class="s0">that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do</span>
<a name="l13685"><span class="ln">13685 </span></a><span class="s0">but to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally</span>
<a name="l13686"><span class="ln">13686 </span></a><span class="s0">to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill,</span>
<a name="l13687"><span class="ln">13687 </span></a><span class="s0">after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of</span>
<a name="l13688"><span class="ln">13688 </span></a><span class="s0">with compassionate allowances.  In one point she was fully justified.</span>
<a name="l13689"><span class="ln">13689 </span></a><span class="s0">She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill.  The event</span>
<a name="l13690"><span class="ln">13690 </span></a><span class="s0">acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness</span>
<a name="l13691"><span class="ln">13691 </span></a><span class="s0">of imaginary complaints.</span>
<a name="l13692"><span class="ln">13692 </span></a>
<a name="l13693"><span class="ln">13693 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:</span>
<a name="l13694"><span class="ln">13694 </span></a><span class="s0">more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try</span>
<a name="l13695"><span class="ln">13695 </span></a><span class="s0">the temper.  It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults,</span>
<a name="l13696"><span class="ln">13696 </span></a><span class="s0">what would Mr. Churchill do without her?  Mr. Churchill's loss</span>
<a name="l13697"><span class="ln">13697 </span></a><span class="s0">would be dreadful indeed.  Mr. Churchill would never get over it.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l13698"><span class="ln">13698 </span></a><span class="s0">Even Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said,</span>
<a name="l13699"><span class="ln">13699 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!&quot; and resolved, that his</span>
<a name="l13700"><span class="ln">13700 </span></a><span class="s0">mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing</span>
<a name="l13701"><span class="ln">13701 </span></a><span class="s0">and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense,</span>
<a name="l13702"><span class="ln">13702 </span></a><span class="s0">true and steady.  How it would affect Frank was among the earliest</span>
<a name="l13703"><span class="ln">13703 </span></a><span class="s0">thoughts of both.  It was also a very early speculation with Emma.</span>
<a name="l13704"><span class="ln">13704 </span></a><span class="s0">The character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her husband--her mind</span>
<a name="l13705"><span class="ln">13705 </span></a><span class="s0">glanced over them both with awe and compassion--and then rested</span>
<a name="l13706"><span class="ln">13706 </span></a><span class="s0">with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event,</span>
<a name="l13707"><span class="ln">13707 </span></a><span class="s0">how benefited, how freed.  She saw in a moment all the possible good.</span>
<a name="l13708"><span class="ln">13708 </span></a><span class="s0">Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter.</span>
<a name="l13709"><span class="ln">13709 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody;</span>
<a name="l13710"><span class="ln">13710 </span></a><span class="s0">an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew.</span>
<a name="l13711"><span class="ln">13711 </span></a><span class="s0">All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form</span>
<a name="l13712"><span class="ln">13712 </span></a><span class="s0">the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel</span>
<a name="l13713"><span class="ln">13713 </span></a><span class="s0">no certainty of its being already formed.</span>
<a name="l13714"><span class="ln">13714 </span></a>
<a name="l13715"><span class="ln">13715 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.</span>
<a name="l13716"><span class="ln">13716 </span></a><span class="s0">What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing.  Emma was</span>
<a name="l13717"><span class="ln">13717 </span></a><span class="s0">gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,</span>
<a name="l13718"><span class="ln">13718 </span></a><span class="s0">and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.</span>
<a name="l13719"><span class="ln">13719 </span></a><span class="s0">They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual forbearance.</span>
<a name="l13720"><span class="ln">13720 </span></a>
<a name="l13721"><span class="ln">13721 </span></a><span class="s0">Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating</span>
<a name="l13722"><span class="ln">13722 </span></a><span class="s0">all that was immediately important of their state and plans.</span>
<a name="l13723"><span class="ln">13723 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their</span>
<a name="l13724"><span class="ln">13724 </span></a><span class="s0">first removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire,</span>
<a name="l13725"><span class="ln">13725 </span></a><span class="s0">was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom</span>
<a name="l13726"><span class="ln">13726 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years.</span>
<a name="l13727"><span class="ln">13727 </span></a><span class="s0">At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes</span>
<a name="l13728"><span class="ln">13728 </span></a><span class="s0">for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side.</span>
<a name="l13729"><span class="ln">13729 </span></a>
<a name="l13730"><span class="ln">13730 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax,</span>
<a name="l13731"><span class="ln">13731 </span></a><span class="s0">whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose</span>
<a name="l13732"><span class="ln">13732 </span></a><span class="s0">engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished</span>
<a name="l13733"><span class="ln">13733 </span></a><span class="s0">to shew her kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish.</span>
<a name="l13734"><span class="ln">13734 </span></a><span class="s0">She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness;</span>
<a name="l13735"><span class="ln">13735 </span></a><span class="s0">and the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now</span>
<a name="l13736"><span class="ln">13736 </span></a><span class="s0">the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of</span>
<a name="l13737"><span class="ln">13737 </span></a><span class="s0">regard or sympathy.  She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew</span>
<a name="l13738"><span class="ln">13738 </span></a><span class="s0">a value for her society, and testify respect and consideration.</span>
<a name="l13739"><span class="ln">13739 </span></a><span class="s0">She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l13740"><span class="ln">13740 </span></a><span class="s0">A note was written to urge it.  The invitation was refused, and by</span>
<a name="l13741"><span class="ln">13741 </span></a><span class="s0">a verbal message.  &quot;Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;&quot;</span>
<a name="l13742"><span class="ln">13742 </span></a><span class="s0">and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning,</span>
<a name="l13743"><span class="ln">13743 </span></a><span class="s0">it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,</span>
<a name="l13744"><span class="ln">13744 </span></a><span class="s0">though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering</span>
<a name="l13745"><span class="ln">13745 </span></a><span class="s0">under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made</span>
<a name="l13746"><span class="ln">13746 </span></a><span class="s0">him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the</span>
<a name="l13747"><span class="ln">13747 </span></a><span class="s0">time proposed.  Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged--</span>
<a name="l13748"><span class="ln">13748 </span></a><span class="s0">appetite quite gone--and though there were no absolutely</span>
<a name="l13749"><span class="ln">13749 </span></a><span class="s0">alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint,</span>
<a name="l13750"><span class="ln">13750 </span></a><span class="s0">which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was</span>
<a name="l13751"><span class="ln">13751 </span></a><span class="s0">uneasy about her.  He thought she had undertaken more than she</span>
<a name="l13752"><span class="ln">13752 </span></a><span class="s0">was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would</span>
<a name="l13753"><span class="ln">13753 </span></a><span class="s0">not own it.  Her spirits seemed overcome.  Her present home,</span>
<a name="l13754"><span class="ln">13754 </span></a><span class="s0">he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:--</span>
<a name="l13755"><span class="ln">13755 </span></a><span class="s0">confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise--</span>
<a name="l13756"><span class="ln">13756 </span></a><span class="s0">and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge</span>
<a name="l13757"><span class="ln">13757 </span></a><span class="s0">to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description.</span>
<a name="l13758"><span class="ln">13758 </span></a><span class="s0">Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact,</span>
<a name="l13759"><span class="ln">13759 </span></a><span class="s0">only too great.  He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more</span>
<a name="l13760"><span class="ln">13760 </span></a><span class="s0">evil than good from them.  Emma listened with the warmest concern;</span>
<a name="l13761"><span class="ln">13761 </span></a><span class="s0">grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover</span>
<a name="l13762"><span class="ln">13762 </span></a><span class="s0">some way of being useful.  To take her--be it only an hour</span>
<a name="l13763"><span class="ln">13763 </span></a><span class="s0">or two--from her aunt, to give her change of air and scene,</span>
<a name="l13764"><span class="ln">13764 </span></a><span class="s0">and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two,</span>
<a name="l13765"><span class="ln">13765 </span></a><span class="s0">might do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say,</span>
<a name="l13766"><span class="ln">13766 </span></a><span class="s0">in the most feeling language she could command, that she would</span>
<a name="l13767"><span class="ln">13767 </span></a><span class="s0">call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name--</span>
<a name="l13768"><span class="ln">13768 </span></a><span class="s0">mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour</span>
<a name="l13769"><span class="ln">13769 </span></a><span class="s0">of such exercise for his patient.  The answer was only in this</span>
<a name="l13770"><span class="ln">13770 </span></a><span class="s0">short note:</span>
<a name="l13771"><span class="ln">13771 </span></a>
<a name="l13772"><span class="ln">13772 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal</span>
<a name="l13773"><span class="ln">13773 </span></a><span class="s0">to any exercise.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13774"><span class="ln">13774 </span></a>
<a name="l13775"><span class="ln">13775 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it</span>
<a name="l13776"><span class="ln">13776 </span></a><span class="s0">was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality</span>
<a name="l13777"><span class="ln">13777 </span></a><span class="s0">shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she</span>
<a name="l13778"><span class="ln">13778 </span></a><span class="s0">might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted.</span>
<a name="l13779"><span class="ln">13779 </span></a><span class="s0">In spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove</span>
<a name="l13780"><span class="ln">13780 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mrs. Bates's, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--</span>
<a name="l13781"><span class="ln">13781 </span></a><span class="s0">but it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude,</span>
<a name="l13782"><span class="ln">13782 </span></a><span class="s0">and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of</span>
<a name="l13783"><span class="ln">13783 </span></a><span class="s0">the greatest service--and every thing that message could do was tried--</span>
<a name="l13784"><span class="ln">13784 </span></a><span class="s0">but all in vain.  Miss Bates was obliged to return without success;</span>
<a name="l13785"><span class="ln">13785 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out</span>
<a name="l13786"><span class="ln">13786 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her,</span>
<a name="l13787"><span class="ln">13787 </span></a><span class="s0">and tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish,</span>
<a name="l13788"><span class="ln">13788 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on</span>
<a name="l13789"><span class="ln">13789 </span></a><span class="s0">no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.  &quot;Indeed, the truth was,</span>
<a name="l13790"><span class="ln">13790 </span></a><span class="s0">that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body--any body at all--</span>
<a name="l13791"><span class="ln">13791 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and Mrs. Cole had made</span>
<a name="l13792"><span class="ln">13792 </span></a><span class="s0">such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but, except them,</span>
<a name="l13793"><span class="ln">13793 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane would really see nobody.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13794"><span class="ln">13794 </span></a>
<a name="l13795"><span class="ln">13795 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,</span>
<a name="l13796"><span class="ln">13796 </span></a><span class="s0">and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;</span>
<a name="l13797"><span class="ln">13797 </span></a><span class="s0">neither could she feel any right of preference herself--</span>
<a name="l13798"><span class="ln">13798 </span></a><span class="s0">she submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther</span>
<a name="l13799"><span class="ln">13799 </span></a><span class="s0">as to her niece's appetite and diet, which she longed to be able</span>
<a name="l13800"><span class="ln">13800 </span></a><span class="s0">to assist.  On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy,</span>
<a name="l13801"><span class="ln">13801 </span></a><span class="s0">and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:--</span>
<a name="l13802"><span class="ln">13802 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could</span>
<a name="l13803"><span class="ln">13803 </span></a><span class="s0">command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.</span>
<a name="l13804"><span class="ln">13804 </span></a>
<a name="l13805"><span class="ln">13805 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an</span>
<a name="l13806"><span class="ln">13806 </span></a><span class="s0">examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality</span>
<a name="l13807"><span class="ln">13807 </span></a><span class="s0">was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note.</span>
<a name="l13808"><span class="ln">13808 </span></a><span class="s0">In half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks</span>
<a name="l13809"><span class="ln">13809 </span></a><span class="s0">from Miss Bates, but &quot;dear Jane would not be satisfied without its</span>
<a name="l13810"><span class="ln">13810 </span></a><span class="s0">being sent back; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover,</span>
<a name="l13811"><span class="ln">13811 </span></a><span class="s0">she insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13812"><span class="ln">13812 </span></a>
<a name="l13813"><span class="ln">13813 </span></a><span class="s0">When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering</span>
<a name="l13814"><span class="ln">13814 </span></a><span class="s0">about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon</span>
<a name="l13815"><span class="ln">13815 </span></a><span class="s0">of the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal</span>
<a name="l13816"><span class="ln">13816 </span></a><span class="s0">to any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in</span>
<a name="l13817"><span class="ln">13817 </span></a><span class="s0">the carriage, she could have no doubt--putting every thing together--</span>
<a name="l13818"><span class="ln">13818 </span></a><span class="s0">that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_.  She was sorry,</span>
<a name="l13819"><span class="ln">13819 </span></a><span class="s0">very sorry.  Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed</span>
<a name="l13820"><span class="ln">13820 </span></a><span class="s0">but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits,</span>
<a name="l13821"><span class="ln">13821 </span></a><span class="s0">inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified</span>
<a name="l13822"><span class="ln">13822 </span></a><span class="s0">her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed</span>
<a name="l13823"><span class="ln">13823 </span></a><span class="s0">so little worthy as a friend:  but she had the consolation of knowing</span>
<a name="l13824"><span class="ln">13824 </span></a><span class="s0">that her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself,</span>
<a name="l13825"><span class="ln">13825 </span></a><span class="s0">that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts</span>
<a name="l13826"><span class="ln">13826 </span></a><span class="s0">of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart,</span>
<a name="l13827"><span class="ln">13827 </span></a><span class="s0">he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.</span>
<a name="l13828"><span class="ln">13828 </span></a>

<a name="l13832"><span class="ln">13832 </span></a>
<a name="l13833"><span class="ln">13833 </span></a>
<a name="l13834"><span class="ln">13834 </span></a><span class="s0">One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease,</span>
<a name="l13835"><span class="ln">13835 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who &quot;could not stay</span>
<a name="l13836"><span class="ln">13836 </span></a><span class="s0">five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l13837"><span class="ln">13837 </span></a><span class="s0">He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did,</span>
<a name="l13838"><span class="ln">13838 </span></a><span class="s0">in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say,</span>
<a name="l13839"><span class="ln">13839 </span></a><span class="s0">unheard by her father,</span>
<a name="l13840"><span class="ln">13840 </span></a>
<a name="l13841"><span class="ln">13841 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it</span>
<a name="l13842"><span class="ln">13842 </span></a><span class="s0">be possible.  Mrs. Weston wants to see you.  She must see you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13843"><span class="ln">13843 </span></a>
<a name="l13844"><span class="ln">13844 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Is she unwell?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13845"><span class="ln">13845 </span></a>
<a name="l13846"><span class="ln">13846 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, no, not at all--only a little agitated.  She would have</span>
<a name="l13847"><span class="ln">13847 </span></a><span class="s0">ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_,</span>
<a name="l13848"><span class="ln">13848 </span></a><span class="s0">and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13849"><span class="ln">13849 </span></a>
<a name="l13850"><span class="ln">13850 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Certainly.  This moment, if you please.  It is impossible to</span>
<a name="l13851"><span class="ln">13851 </span></a><span class="s0">refuse what you ask in such a way.  But what can be the matter?--</span>
<a name="l13852"><span class="ln">13852 </span></a><span class="s0">Is she really not ill?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13853"><span class="ln">13853 </span></a>
<a name="l13854"><span class="ln">13854 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Depend upon me--but ask no more questions.  You will know it</span>
<a name="l13855"><span class="ln">13855 </span></a><span class="s0">all in time.  The most unaccountable business!  But hush, hush!&quot;</span>
<a name="l13856"><span class="ln">13856 </span></a>
<a name="l13857"><span class="ln">13857 </span></a><span class="s0">To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.</span>
<a name="l13858"><span class="ln">13858 </span></a><span class="s0">Something really important seemed announced by his looks;</span>
<a name="l13859"><span class="ln">13859 </span></a><span class="s0">but, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy,</span>
<a name="l13860"><span class="ln">13860 </span></a><span class="s0">and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now,</span>
<a name="l13861"><span class="ln">13861 </span></a><span class="s0">she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on</span>
<a name="l13862"><span class="ln">13862 </span></a><span class="s0">their way at a quick pace for Randalls.</span>
<a name="l13863"><span class="ln">13863 </span></a>
<a name="l13864"><span class="ln">13864 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Now,&quot;--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--</span>
<a name="l13865"><span class="ln">13865 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13866"><span class="ln">13866 </span></a>
<a name="l13867"><span class="ln">13867 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, no,&quot;--he gravely replied.--&quot;Don't ask me.  I promised my wife</span>
<a name="l13868"><span class="ln">13868 </span></a><span class="s0">to leave it all to her.  She will break it to you better than I can.</span>
<a name="l13869"><span class="ln">13869 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13870"><span class="ln">13870 </span></a>
<a name="l13871"><span class="ln">13871 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Break it to me,&quot; cried Emma, standing still with terror.--</span>
<a name="l13872"><span class="ln">13872 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Good God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened</span>
<a name="l13873"><span class="ln">13873 </span></a><span class="s0">in Brunswick Square.  I know it has.  Tell me, I charge you tell</span>
<a name="l13874"><span class="ln">13874 </span></a><span class="s0">me this moment what it is.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13875"><span class="ln">13875 </span></a>
<a name="l13876"><span class="ln">13876 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, indeed you are mistaken.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l13877"><span class="ln">13877 </span></a>
<a name="l13878"><span class="ln">13878 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest</span>
<a name="l13879"><span class="ln">13879 </span></a><span class="s0">friends are now in Brunswick Square.  Which of them is it?--</span>
<a name="l13880"><span class="ln">13880 </span></a><span class="s0">I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13881"><span class="ln">13881 </span></a>
<a name="l13882"><span class="ln">13882 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon my word, Emma.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l13883"><span class="ln">13883 </span></a>
<a name="l13884"><span class="ln">13884 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour,</span>
<a name="l13885"><span class="ln">13885 </span></a><span class="s0">that it has nothing to do with any of them?  Good Heavens!--What can</span>
<a name="l13886"><span class="ln">13886 </span></a><span class="s0">be to be _broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13887"><span class="ln">13887 </span></a>
<a name="l13888"><span class="ln">13888 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon my honour,&quot; said he very seriously, &quot;it does not.  It is not</span>
<a name="l13889"><span class="ln">13889 </span></a><span class="s0">in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name</span>
<a name="l13890"><span class="ln">13890 </span></a><span class="s0">of Knightley.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13891"><span class="ln">13891 </span></a>
<a name="l13892"><span class="ln">13892 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.</span>
<a name="l13893"><span class="ln">13893 </span></a>
<a name="l13894"><span class="ln">13894 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I was wrong,&quot; he continued, &quot;in talking of its being _broke_ to you.</span>
<a name="l13895"><span class="ln">13895 </span></a><span class="s0">I should not have used the expression.  In fact, it does not concern you--</span>
<a name="l13896"><span class="ln">13896 </span></a><span class="s0">it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short,</span>
<a name="l13897"><span class="ln">13897 </span></a><span class="s0">my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.</span>
<a name="l13898"><span class="ln">13898 </span></a><span class="s0">I don't say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might</span>
<a name="l13899"><span class="ln">13899 </span></a><span class="s0">be much worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13900"><span class="ln">13900 </span></a>
<a name="l13901"><span class="ln">13901 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort.</span>
<a name="l13902"><span class="ln">13902 </span></a><span class="s0">She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,</span>
<a name="l13903"><span class="ln">13903 </span></a><span class="s0">and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some</span>
<a name="l13904"><span class="ln">13904 </span></a><span class="s0">money concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable</span>
<a name="l13905"><span class="ln">13905 </span></a><span class="s0">nature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late</span>
<a name="l13906"><span class="ln">13906 </span></a><span class="s0">event at Richmond had brought forward.  Her fancy was very active.</span>
<a name="l13907"><span class="ln">13907 </span></a><span class="s0">Half a dozen natural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--</span>
<a name="l13908"><span class="ln">13908 </span></a><span class="s0">This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her.</span>
<a name="l13909"><span class="ln">13909 </span></a><span class="s0">It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.</span>
<a name="l13910"><span class="ln">13910 </span></a>
<a name="l13911"><span class="ln">13911 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Who is that gentleman on horseback?&quot; said she, as they proceeded--</span>
<a name="l13912"><span class="ln">13912 </span></a><span class="s0">speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with</span>
<a name="l13913"><span class="ln">13913 </span></a><span class="s0">any other view.</span>
<a name="l13914"><span class="ln">13914 </span></a>
<a name="l13915"><span class="ln">13915 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank,</span>
<a name="l13916"><span class="ln">13916 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you.  You will not see him.  He is half way to Windsor</span>
<a name="l13917"><span class="ln">13917 </span></a><span class="s0">by this time.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13918"><span class="ln">13918 </span></a>
<a name="l13919"><span class="ln">13919 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Has your son been with you, then?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13920"><span class="ln">13920 </span></a>
<a name="l13921"><span class="ln">13921 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13922"><span class="ln">13922 </span></a>
<a name="l13923"><span class="ln">13923 </span></a><span class="s0">For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more</span>
<a name="l13924"><span class="ln">13924 </span></a><span class="s0">guarded and demure,</span>
<a name="l13925"><span class="ln">13925 </span></a>
<a name="l13926"><span class="ln">13926 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13927"><span class="ln">13927 </span></a>
<a name="l13928"><span class="ln">13928 </span></a><span class="s0">They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--&quot;Well, my dear,&quot;</span>
<a name="l13929"><span class="ln">13929 </span></a><span class="s0">said he, as they entered the room--&quot;I have brought her, and now</span>
<a name="l13930"><span class="ln">13930 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope you will soon be better.  I shall leave you together.</span>
<a name="l13931"><span class="ln">13931 </span></a><span class="s0">There is no use in delay.  I shall not be far off, if you want me.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l13932"><span class="ln">13932 </span></a><span class="s0">And Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he</span>
<a name="l13933"><span class="ln">13933 </span></a><span class="s0">quitted the room,--&quot;I have been as good as my word.  She has not the</span>
<a name="l13934"><span class="ln">13934 </span></a><span class="s0">least idea.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13935"><span class="ln">13935 </span></a>
<a name="l13936"><span class="ln">13936 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,</span>
<a name="l13937"><span class="ln">13937 </span></a><span class="s0">that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone,</span>
<a name="l13938"><span class="ln">13938 </span></a><span class="s0">she eagerly said,</span>
<a name="l13939"><span class="ln">13939 </span></a>
<a name="l13940"><span class="ln">13940 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What is it my dear friend?  Something of a very unpleasant nature,</span>
<a name="l13941"><span class="ln">13941 </span></a><span class="s0">I find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is.</span>
<a name="l13942"><span class="ln">13942 </span></a><span class="s0">I have been walking all this way in complete suspense.  We both</span>
<a name="l13943"><span class="ln">13943 </span></a><span class="s0">abhor suspense.  Do not let mine continue longer.  It will do you</span>
<a name="l13944"><span class="ln">13944 </span></a><span class="s0">good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13945"><span class="ln">13945 </span></a>
<a name="l13946"><span class="ln">13946 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Have you indeed no idea?&quot; said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.</span>
<a name="l13947"><span class="ln">13947 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you</span>
<a name="l13948"><span class="ln">13948 </span></a><span class="s0">are to hear?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13949"><span class="ln">13949 </span></a>
<a name="l13950"><span class="ln">13950 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13951"><span class="ln">13951 </span></a>
<a name="l13952"><span class="ln">13952 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are right.  It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;&quot;</span>
<a name="l13953"><span class="ln">13953 </span></a><span class="s0">(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)</span>
<a name="l13954"><span class="ln">13954 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand.</span>
<a name="l13955"><span class="ln">13955 </span></a><span class="s0">It is impossible to express our surprize.  He came to speak to his</span>
<a name="l13956"><span class="ln">13956 </span></a><span class="s0">father on a subject,--to announce an attachment--&quot;</span>
<a name="l13957"><span class="ln">13957 </span></a>
<a name="l13958"><span class="ln">13958 </span></a><span class="s0">She stopped to breathe.  Emma thought first of herself, and then</span>
<a name="l13959"><span class="ln">13959 </span></a><span class="s0">of Harriet.</span>
<a name="l13960"><span class="ln">13960 </span></a>
<a name="l13961"><span class="ln">13961 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;More than an attachment, indeed,&quot; resumed Mrs. Weston; &quot;an engagement--</span>
<a name="l13962"><span class="ln">13962 </span></a><span class="s0">a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will any</span>
<a name="l13963"><span class="ln">13963 </span></a><span class="s0">body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax</span>
<a name="l13964"><span class="ln">13964 </span></a><span class="s0">are engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!&quot;</span>
<a name="l13965"><span class="ln">13965 </span></a>
<a name="l13966"><span class="ln">13966 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,</span>
<a name="l13967"><span class="ln">13967 </span></a>
<a name="l13968"><span class="ln">13968 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Jane Fairfax!--Good God!  You are not serious?  You do not mean it?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13969"><span class="ln">13969 </span></a>
<a name="l13970"><span class="ln">13970 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You may well be amazed,&quot; returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,</span>
<a name="l13971"><span class="ln">13971 </span></a><span class="s0">and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--</span>
<a name="l13972"><span class="ln">13972 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You may well be amazed.  But it is even so.  There has been a solemn</span>
<a name="l13973"><span class="ln">13973 </span></a><span class="s0">engagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth,</span>
<a name="l13974"><span class="ln">13974 </span></a><span class="s0">and kept a secret from every body.  Not a creature knowing it</span>
<a name="l13975"><span class="ln">13975 </span></a><span class="s0">but themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--</span>
<a name="l13976"><span class="ln">13976 </span></a><span class="s0">It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact,</span>
<a name="l13977"><span class="ln">13977 </span></a><span class="s0">it is yet almost incredible to myself.  I can hardly believe it.--</span>
<a name="l13978"><span class="ln">13978 </span></a><span class="s0">I thought I knew him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13979"><span class="ln">13979 </span></a>
<a name="l13980"><span class="ln">13980 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between</span>
<a name="l13981"><span class="ln">13981 </span></a><span class="s0">two ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;</span>
<a name="l13982"><span class="ln">13982 </span></a><span class="s0">and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim,</span>
<a name="l13983"><span class="ln">13983 </span></a><span class="s0">and require confirmation, repeated confirmation.</span>
<a name="l13984"><span class="ln">13984 </span></a>
<a name="l13985"><span class="ln">13985 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said she at last, trying to recover herself; &quot;this is a</span>
<a name="l13986"><span class="ln">13986 </span></a><span class="s0">circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I</span>
<a name="l13987"><span class="ln">13987 </span></a><span class="s0">can at all comprehend it.  What!--engaged to her all the winter--</span>
<a name="l13988"><span class="ln">13988 </span></a><span class="s0">before either of them came to Highbury?&quot;</span>
<a name="l13989"><span class="ln">13989 </span></a>
<a name="l13990"><span class="ln">13990 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me,</span>
<a name="l13991"><span class="ln">13991 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma, very much.  It has hurt his father equally.  _Some_ _part_</span>
<a name="l13992"><span class="ln">13992 </span></a><span class="s0">of his conduct we cannot excuse.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13993"><span class="ln">13993 </span></a>
<a name="l13994"><span class="ln">13994 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, &quot;I will not pretend</span>
<a name="l13995"><span class="ln">13995 </span></a><span class="s0">_not_ to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power,</span>
<a name="l13996"><span class="ln">13996 </span></a><span class="s0">be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me,</span>
<a name="l13997"><span class="ln">13997 </span></a><span class="s0">as you are apprehensive of.&quot;</span>
<a name="l13998"><span class="ln">13998 </span></a>
<a name="l13999"><span class="ln">13999 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance</span>
<a name="l14000"><span class="ln">14000 </span></a><span class="s0">was as steady as her words.</span>
<a name="l14001"><span class="ln">14001 </span></a>
<a name="l14002"><span class="ln">14002 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my</span>
<a name="l14003"><span class="ln">14003 </span></a><span class="s0">present perfect indifference,&quot; she continued, &quot;I will farther tell you,</span>
<a name="l14004"><span class="ln">14004 </span></a><span class="s0">that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance,</span>
<a name="l14005"><span class="ln">14005 </span></a><span class="s0">when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be</span>
<a name="l14006"><span class="ln">14006 </span></a><span class="s0">attached to him--nay, was attached--and how it came to cease,</span>
<a name="l14007"><span class="ln">14007 </span></a><span class="s0">is perhaps the wonder.  Fortunately, however, it did cease.</span>
<a name="l14008"><span class="ln">14008 </span></a><span class="s0">I have really for some time past, for at least these three months,</span>
<a name="l14009"><span class="ln">14009 </span></a><span class="s0">cared nothing about him.  You may believe me, Mrs. Weston.</span>
<a name="l14010"><span class="ln">14010 </span></a><span class="s0">This is the simple truth.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14011"><span class="ln">14011 </span></a>
<a name="l14012"><span class="ln">14012 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could</span>
<a name="l14013"><span class="ln">14013 </span></a><span class="s0">find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done</span>
<a name="l14014"><span class="ln">14014 </span></a><span class="s0">her more good than any thing else in the world could do.</span>
<a name="l14015"><span class="ln">14015 </span></a>
<a name="l14016"><span class="ln">14016 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,&quot; said she.</span>
<a name="l14017"><span class="ln">14017 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;On this point we have been wretched.  It was our darling wish that you</span>
<a name="l14018"><span class="ln">14018 </span></a><span class="s0">might be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--</span>
<a name="l14019"><span class="ln">14019 </span></a><span class="s0">Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14020"><span class="ln">14020 </span></a>
<a name="l14021"><span class="ln">14021 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of</span>
<a name="l14022"><span class="ln">14022 </span></a><span class="s0">grateful wonder to you and myself.  But this does not acquit _him_,</span>
<a name="l14023"><span class="ln">14023 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame.</span>
<a name="l14024"><span class="ln">14024 </span></a><span class="s0">What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged,</span>
<a name="l14025"><span class="ln">14025 </span></a><span class="s0">and with manners so _very_ disengaged?  What right had he to endeavour</span>
<a name="l14026"><span class="ln">14026 </span></a><span class="s0">to please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with</span>
<a name="l14027"><span class="ln">14027 </span></a><span class="s0">persevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged</span>
<a name="l14028"><span class="ln">14028 </span></a><span class="s0">to another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--</span>
<a name="l14029"><span class="ln">14029 </span></a><span class="s0">How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--</span>
<a name="l14030"><span class="ln">14030 </span></a><span class="s0">very wrong, very wrong indeed.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14031"><span class="ln">14031 </span></a>
<a name="l14032"><span class="ln">14032 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--&quot;</span>
<a name="l14033"><span class="ln">14033 </span></a>
<a name="l14034"><span class="ln">14034 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And how could _she_ bear such behaviour!  Composure with a witness!</span>
<a name="l14035"><span class="ln">14035 </span></a><span class="s0">to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,</span>
<a name="l14036"><span class="ln">14036 </span></a><span class="s0">before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,</span>
<a name="l14037"><span class="ln">14037 </span></a><span class="s0">which I can neither comprehend nor respect.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14038"><span class="ln">14038 </span></a>
<a name="l14039"><span class="ln">14039 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said</span>
<a name="l14040"><span class="ln">14040 </span></a><span class="s0">so expressly.  He had not time to enter into much explanation.</span>
<a name="l14041"><span class="ln">14041 </span></a><span class="s0">He was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation</span>
<a name="l14042"><span class="ln">14042 </span></a><span class="s0">which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay--</span>
<a name="l14043"><span class="ln">14043 </span></a><span class="s0">but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said.</span>
<a name="l14044"><span class="ln">14044 </span></a><span class="s0">The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them;</span>
<a name="l14045"><span class="ln">14045 </span></a><span class="s0">and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the</span>
<a name="l14046"><span class="ln">14046 </span></a><span class="s0">impropriety of his conduct.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14047"><span class="ln">14047 </span></a>
<a name="l14048"><span class="ln">14048 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Impropriety!  Oh!  Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure.</span>
<a name="l14049"><span class="ln">14049 </span></a><span class="s0">Much, much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how</span>
<a name="l14050"><span class="ln">14050 </span></a><span class="s0">it has sunk him in my opinion.  So unlike what a man should be!--</span>
<a name="l14051"><span class="ln">14051 </span></a><span class="s0">None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth</span>
<a name="l14052"><span class="ln">14052 </span></a><span class="s0">and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man</span>
<a name="l14053"><span class="ln">14053 </span></a><span class="s0">should display in every transaction of his life.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14054"><span class="ln">14054 </span></a>
<a name="l14055"><span class="ln">14055 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been</span>
<a name="l14056"><span class="ln">14056 </span></a><span class="s0">wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer</span>
<a name="l14057"><span class="ln">14057 </span></a><span class="s0">for his having many, very many, good qualities; and--&quot;</span>
<a name="l14058"><span class="ln">14058 </span></a>
<a name="l14059"><span class="ln">14059 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Good God!&quot; cried Emma, not attending to her.--&quot;Mrs. Smallridge, too!</span>
<a name="l14060"><span class="ln">14060 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane actually on the point of going as governess!  What could he</span>
<a name="l14061"><span class="ln">14061 </span></a><span class="s0">mean by such horrible indelicacy?  To suffer her to engage herself--</span>
<a name="l14062"><span class="ln">14062 </span></a><span class="s0">to suffer her even to think of such a measure!&quot;</span>
<a name="l14063"><span class="ln">14063 </span></a>
<a name="l14064"><span class="ln">14064 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He knew nothing about it, Emma.  On this article I can fully</span>
<a name="l14065"><span class="ln">14065 </span></a><span class="s0">acquit him.  It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated</span>
<a name="l14066"><span class="ln">14066 </span></a><span class="s0">to him--or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--</span>
<a name="l14067"><span class="ln">14067 </span></a><span class="s0">Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans.</span>
<a name="l14068"><span class="ln">14068 </span></a><span class="s0">They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message--</span>
<a name="l14069"><span class="ln">14069 </span></a><span class="s0">and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project</span>
<a name="l14070"><span class="ln">14070 </span></a><span class="s0">of hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it</span>
<a name="l14071"><span class="ln">14071 </span></a><span class="s0">all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short,</span>
<a name="l14072"><span class="ln">14072 </span></a><span class="s0">put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been</span>
<a name="l14073"><span class="ln">14073 </span></a><span class="s0">carrying on so long.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14074"><span class="ln">14074 </span></a>
<a name="l14075"><span class="ln">14075 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma began to listen better.</span>
<a name="l14076"><span class="ln">14076 </span></a>
<a name="l14077"><span class="ln">14077 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am to hear from him soon,&quot; continued Mrs. Weston.  &quot;He told me</span>
<a name="l14078"><span class="ln">14078 </span></a><span class="s0">at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which</span>
<a name="l14079"><span class="ln">14079 </span></a><span class="s0">seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now.</span>
<a name="l14080"><span class="ln">14080 </span></a><span class="s0">Let us wait, therefore, for this letter.  It may bring many extenuations.</span>
<a name="l14081"><span class="ln">14081 </span></a><span class="s0">It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are</span>
<a name="l14082"><span class="ln">14082 </span></a><span class="s0">not to be understood.  Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in</span>
<a name="l14083"><span class="ln">14083 </span></a><span class="s0">a hurry to condemn him.  Let us have patience.  I must love him;</span>
<a name="l14084"><span class="ln">14084 </span></a><span class="s0">and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point,</span>
<a name="l14085"><span class="ln">14085 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready</span>
<a name="l14086"><span class="ln">14086 </span></a><span class="s0">to hope that it may.  They must both have suffered a great deal</span>
<a name="l14087"><span class="ln">14087 </span></a><span class="s0">under such a system of secresy and concealment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14088"><span class="ln">14088 </span></a>
<a name="l14089"><span class="ln">14089 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;_His_ sufferings,&quot; replied Emma dryly, &quot;do not appear to have done</span>
<a name="l14090"><span class="ln">14090 </span></a><span class="s0">him much harm.  Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?&quot;</span>
<a name="l14091"><span class="ln">14091 </span></a>
<a name="l14092"><span class="ln">14092 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely</span>
<a name="l14093"><span class="ln">14093 </span></a><span class="s0">a difficulty.  Conceive what the events of a week have done</span>
<a name="l14094"><span class="ln">14094 </span></a><span class="s0">in that family!  While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there</span>
<a name="l14095"><span class="ln">14095 </span></a><span class="s0">could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely</span>
<a name="l14096"><span class="ln">14096 </span></a><span class="s0">are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is</span>
<a name="l14097"><span class="ln">14097 </span></a><span class="s0">persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required.</span>
<a name="l14098"><span class="ln">14098 </span></a><span class="s0">What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!--</span>
<a name="l14099"><span class="ln">14099 </span></a><span class="s0">He gave his consent with very little persuasion.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14100"><span class="ln">14100 </span></a>
<a name="l14101"><span class="ln">14101 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!&quot; thought Emma, &quot;he would have done as much for Harriet.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14102"><span class="ln">14102 </span></a>
<a name="l14103"><span class="ln">14103 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light</span>
<a name="l14104"><span class="ln">14104 </span></a><span class="s0">this morning.  He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy,</span>
<a name="l14105"><span class="ln">14105 </span></a><span class="s0">some time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get</span>
<a name="l14106"><span class="ln">14106 </span></a><span class="s0">back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,</span>
<a name="l14107"><span class="ln">14107 </span></a><span class="s0">that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--</span>
<a name="l14108"><span class="ln">14108 </span></a><span class="s0">He was very much agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made</span>
<a name="l14109"><span class="ln">14109 </span></a><span class="s0">him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen</span>
<a name="l14110"><span class="ln">14110 </span></a><span class="s0">him before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of</span>
<a name="l14111"><span class="ln">14111 </span></a><span class="s0">finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--</span>
<a name="l14112"><span class="ln">14112 </span></a><span class="s0">and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14113"><span class="ln">14113 </span></a>
<a name="l14114"><span class="ln">14114 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on</span>
<a name="l14115"><span class="ln">14115 </span></a><span class="s0">with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none</span>
<a name="l14116"><span class="ln">14116 </span></a><span class="s0">of them know of the engagement?&quot;</span>
<a name="l14117"><span class="ln">14117 </span></a>
<a name="l14118"><span class="ln">14118 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.</span>
<a name="l14119"><span class="ln">14119 </span></a>
<a name="l14120"><span class="ln">14120 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;None; not one.  He positively said that it had been known to no</span>
<a name="l14121"><span class="ln">14121 </span></a><span class="s0">being in the world but their two selves.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14122"><span class="ln">14122 </span></a>
<a name="l14123"><span class="ln">14123 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well,&quot; said Emma, &quot;I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled</span>
<a name="l14124"><span class="ln">14124 </span></a><span class="s0">to the idea, and I wish them very happy.  But I shall always</span>
<a name="l14125"><span class="ln">14125 </span></a><span class="s0">think it a very abominable sort of proceeding.  What has it been</span>
<a name="l14126"><span class="ln">14126 </span></a><span class="s0">but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--</span>
<a name="l14127"><span class="ln">14127 </span></a><span class="s0">To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity;</span>
<a name="l14128"><span class="ln">14128 </span></a><span class="s0">and such a league in secret to judge us all!--Here have we been,</span>
<a name="l14129"><span class="ln">14129 </span></a><span class="s0">the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves</span>
<a name="l14130"><span class="ln">14130 </span></a><span class="s0">all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the</span>
<a name="l14131"><span class="ln">14131 </span></a><span class="s0">midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting</span>
<a name="l14132"><span class="ln">14132 </span></a><span class="s0">in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both</span>
<a name="l14133"><span class="ln">14133 </span></a><span class="s0">to hear.--They must take the consequence, if they have heard each</span>
<a name="l14134"><span class="ln">14134 </span></a><span class="s0">other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!&quot;</span>
<a name="l14135"><span class="ln">14135 </span></a>
<a name="l14136"><span class="ln">14136 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am quite easy on that head,&quot; replied Mrs. Weston.  &quot;I am</span>
<a name="l14137"><span class="ln">14137 </span></a><span class="s0">very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other,</span>
<a name="l14138"><span class="ln">14138 </span></a><span class="s0">which both might not have heard.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14139"><span class="ln">14139 </span></a>
<a name="l14140"><span class="ln">14140 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear,</span>
<a name="l14141"><span class="ln">14141 </span></a><span class="s0">when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14142"><span class="ln">14142 </span></a>
<a name="l14143"><span class="ln">14143 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;True.  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss</span>
<a name="l14144"><span class="ln">14144 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her;</span>
<a name="l14145"><span class="ln">14145 </span></a><span class="s0">and as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14146"><span class="ln">14146 </span></a>
<a name="l14147"><span class="ln">14147 </span></a><span class="s0">At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,</span>
<a name="l14148"><span class="ln">14148 </span></a><span class="s0">evidently on the watch.  His wife gave him a look which invited</span>
<a name="l14149"><span class="ln">14149 </span></a><span class="s0">him in; and, while he was coming round, added, &quot;Now, dearest Emma,</span>
<a name="l14150"><span class="ln">14150 </span></a><span class="s0">let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his</span>
<a name="l14151"><span class="ln">14151 </span></a><span class="s0">heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match.</span>
<a name="l14152"><span class="ln">14152 </span></a><span class="s0">Let us make the best of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may</span>
<a name="l14153"><span class="ln">14153 </span></a><span class="s0">be fairly said in her favour.  It is not a connexion to gratify;</span>
<a name="l14154"><span class="ln">14154 </span></a><span class="s0">but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it</span>
<a name="l14155"><span class="ln">14155 </span></a><span class="s0">may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,</span>
<a name="l14156"><span class="ln">14156 </span></a><span class="s0">that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness</span>
<a name="l14157"><span class="ln">14157 </span></a><span class="s0">of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for--</span>
<a name="l14158"><span class="ln">14158 </span></a><span class="s0">and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this</span>
<a name="l14159"><span class="ln">14159 </span></a><span class="s0">one great deviation from the strict rule of right.  And how much</span>
<a name="l14160"><span class="ln">14160 </span></a><span class="s0">may be said in her situation for even that error!&quot;</span>
<a name="l14161"><span class="ln">14161 </span></a>
<a name="l14162"><span class="ln">14162 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Much, indeed!&quot; cried Emma feelingly.  &quot;If a woman can ever</span>
<a name="l14163"><span class="ln">14163 </span></a><span class="s0">be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation</span>
<a name="l14164"><span class="ln">14164 </span></a><span class="s0">like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the</span>
<a name="l14165"><span class="ln">14165 </span></a><span class="s0">world is not their's, nor the world's law.'&quot;</span>
<a name="l14166"><span class="ln">14166 </span></a>
<a name="l14167"><span class="ln">14167 </span></a><span class="s0">She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,</span>
<a name="l14168"><span class="ln">14168 </span></a><span class="s0">exclaiming,</span>
<a name="l14169"><span class="ln">14169 </span></a>
<a name="l14170"><span class="ln">14170 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word!</span>
<a name="l14171"><span class="ln">14171 </span></a><span class="s0">This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity,</span>
<a name="l14172"><span class="ln">14172 </span></a><span class="s0">and exercise my talent of guessing.  But you really frightened me.</span>
<a name="l14173"><span class="ln">14173 </span></a><span class="s0">I thought you had lost half your property, at least.  And here,</span>
<a name="l14174"><span class="ln">14174 </span></a><span class="s0">instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one</span>
<a name="l14175"><span class="ln">14175 </span></a><span class="s0">of congratulation.--I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart,</span>
<a name="l14176"><span class="ln">14176 </span></a><span class="s0">on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished</span>
<a name="l14177"><span class="ln">14177 </span></a><span class="s0">young women in England for your daughter.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14178"><span class="ln">14178 </span></a>
<a name="l14179"><span class="ln">14179 </span></a><span class="s0">A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was</span>
<a name="l14180"><span class="ln">14180 </span></a><span class="s0">as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits</span>
<a name="l14181"><span class="ln">14181 </span></a><span class="s0">was immediate.  His air and voice recovered their usual briskness:</span>
<a name="l14182"><span class="ln">14182 </span></a><span class="s0">he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered</span>
<a name="l14183"><span class="ln">14183 </span></a><span class="s0">on the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted</span>
<a name="l14184"><span class="ln">14184 </span></a><span class="s0">time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing.</span>
<a name="l14185"><span class="ln">14185 </span></a><span class="s0">His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence,</span>
<a name="l14186"><span class="ln">14186 </span></a><span class="s0">or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all</span>
<a name="l14187"><span class="ln">14187 </span></a><span class="s0">over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma,</span>
<a name="l14188"><span class="ln">14188 </span></a><span class="s0">in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled,</span>
<a name="l14189"><span class="ln">14189 </span></a><span class="s0">and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could</span>
<a name="l14190"><span class="ln">14190 </span></a><span class="s0">possibly have done.</span>
<a name="l14191"><span class="ln">14191 </span></a>

<a name="l14196"><span class="ln">14196 </span></a>
<a name="l14197"><span class="ln">14197 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Harriet, poor Harriet!&quot;--Those were the words; in them lay the</span>
<a name="l14198"><span class="ln">14198 </span></a><span class="s0">tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted</span>
<a name="l14199"><span class="ln">14199 </span></a><span class="s0">the real misery of the business to her.  Frank Churchill had behaved</span>
<a name="l14200"><span class="ln">14200 </span></a><span class="s0">very ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much</span>
<a name="l14201"><span class="ln">14201 </span></a><span class="s0">_his_ behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him.</span>
<a name="l14202"><span class="ln">14202 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account,</span>
<a name="l14203"><span class="ln">14203 </span></a><span class="s0">that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second</span>
<a name="l14204"><span class="ln">14204 </span></a><span class="s0">time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery.  Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l14205"><span class="ln">14205 </span></a><span class="s0">had spoken prophetically, when he once said, &quot;Emma, you have been</span>
<a name="l14206"><span class="ln">14206 </span></a><span class="s0">no friend to Harriet Smith.&quot;--She was afraid she had done her nothing</span>
<a name="l14207"><span class="ln">14207 </span></a><span class="s0">but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself,</span>
<a name="l14208"><span class="ln">14208 </span></a><span class="s0">in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original</span>
<a name="l14209"><span class="ln">14209 </span></a><span class="s0">author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might</span>
<a name="l14210"><span class="ln">14210 </span></a><span class="s0">otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet</span>
<a name="l14211"><span class="ln">14211 </span></a><span class="s0">had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill</span>
<a name="l14212"><span class="ln">14212 </span></a><span class="s0">before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt</span>
<a name="l14213"><span class="ln">14213 </span></a><span class="s0">completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed.</span>
<a name="l14214"><span class="ln">14214 </span></a><span class="s0">She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments.</span>
<a name="l14215"><span class="ln">14215 </span></a><span class="s0">Her influence would have been enough.  And now she was very conscious</span>
<a name="l14216"><span class="ln">14216 </span></a><span class="s0">that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been</span>
<a name="l14217"><span class="ln">14217 </span></a><span class="s0">risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds.</span>
<a name="l14218"><span class="ln">14218 </span></a><span class="s0">Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she</span>
<a name="l14219"><span class="ln">14219 </span></a><span class="s0">must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five</span>
<a name="l14220"><span class="ln">14220 </span></a><span class="s0">hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--&quot;But, with</span>
<a name="l14221"><span class="ln">14221 </span></a><span class="s0">common sense,&quot; she added, &quot;I am afraid I have had little to do.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14222"><span class="ln">14222 </span></a>
<a name="l14223"><span class="ln">14223 </span></a><span class="s0">She was extremely angry with herself.  If she could not have been</span>
<a name="l14224"><span class="ln">14224 </span></a><span class="s0">angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--</span>
<a name="l14225"><span class="ln">14225 </span></a><span class="s0">As for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings</span>
<a name="l14226"><span class="ln">14226 </span></a><span class="s0">from any present solicitude on her account.  Harriet would</span>
<a name="l14227"><span class="ln">14227 </span></a><span class="s0">be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane,</span>
<a name="l14228"><span class="ln">14228 </span></a><span class="s0">whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin,</span>
<a name="l14229"><span class="ln">14229 </span></a><span class="s0">must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil</span>
<a name="l14230"><span class="ln">14230 </span></a><span class="s0">were over.--She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.--</span>
<a name="l14231"><span class="ln">14231 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted.</span>
<a name="l14232"><span class="ln">14232 </span></a><span class="s0">This discovery laid many smaller matters open.  No doubt it had been</span>
<a name="l14233"><span class="ln">14233 </span></a><span class="s0">from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and well might</span>
<a name="l14234"><span class="ln">14234 </span></a><span class="s0">any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed.</span>
<a name="l14235"><span class="ln">14235 </span></a><span class="s0">An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,</span>
<a name="l14236"><span class="ln">14236 </span></a><span class="s0">and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.</span>
<a name="l14237"><span class="ln">14237 </span></a><span class="s0">She understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself</span>
<a name="l14238"><span class="ln">14238 </span></a><span class="s0">from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged</span>
<a name="l14239"><span class="ln">14239 </span></a><span class="s0">that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond</span>
<a name="l14240"><span class="ln">14240 </span></a><span class="s0">her desert.  But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!</span>
<a name="l14241"><span class="ln">14241 </span></a><span class="s0">There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else.</span>
<a name="l14242"><span class="ln">14242 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be</span>
<a name="l14243"><span class="ln">14243 </span></a><span class="s0">more severe than the first.  Considering the very superior claims</span>
<a name="l14244"><span class="ln">14244 </span></a><span class="s0">of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect</span>
<a name="l14245"><span class="ln">14245 </span></a><span class="s0">on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.--</span>
<a name="l14246"><span class="ln">14246 </span></a><span class="s0">She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon</span>
<a name="l14247"><span class="ln">14247 </span></a><span class="s0">as possible.  An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's</span>
<a name="l14248"><span class="ln">14248 </span></a><span class="s0">parting words.  &quot;For the present, the whole affair was to be</span>
<a name="l14249"><span class="ln">14249 </span></a><span class="s0">completely a secret.  Mr. Churchill had made a point of it,</span>
<a name="l14250"><span class="ln">14250 </span></a><span class="s0">as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;</span>
<a name="l14251"><span class="ln">14251 </span></a><span class="s0">and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l14252"><span class="ln">14252 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.  It was her</span>
<a name="l14253"><span class="ln">14253 </span></a><span class="s0">superior duty.</span>
<a name="l14254"><span class="ln">14254 </span></a>
<a name="l14255"><span class="ln">14255 </span></a><span class="s0">In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous,</span>
<a name="l14256"><span class="ln">14256 </span></a><span class="s0">that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to</span>
<a name="l14257"><span class="ln">14257 </span></a><span class="s0">perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself.</span>
<a name="l14258"><span class="ln">14258 </span></a><span class="s0">The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,</span>
<a name="l14259"><span class="ln">14259 </span></a><span class="s0">she was now to be anxiously announcing to another.  Her heart beat</span>
<a name="l14260"><span class="ln">14260 </span></a><span class="s0">quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed,</span>
<a name="l14261"><span class="ln">14261 </span></a><span class="s0">had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls.</span>
<a name="l14262"><span class="ln">14262 </span></a><span class="s0">Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--</span>
<a name="l14263"><span class="ln">14263 </span></a><span class="s0">But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.</span>
<a name="l14264"><span class="ln">14264 </span></a>
<a name="l14265"><span class="ln">14265 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, Miss Woodhouse!&quot; cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--</span>
<a name="l14266"><span class="ln">14266 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;is not this the oddest news that ever was?&quot;</span>
<a name="l14267"><span class="ln">14267 </span></a>
<a name="l14268"><span class="ln">14268 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What news do you mean?&quot; replied Emma, unable to guess, by look</span>
<a name="l14269"><span class="ln">14269 </span></a><span class="s0">or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.</span>
<a name="l14270"><span class="ln">14270 </span></a>
<a name="l14271"><span class="ln">14271 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;About Jane Fairfax.  Did you ever hear any thing so strange?</span>
<a name="l14272"><span class="ln">14272 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has</span>
<a name="l14273"><span class="ln">14273 </span></a><span class="s0">told me himself.  I met him just now.  He told me it was to be</span>
<a name="l14274"><span class="ln">14274 </span></a><span class="s0">a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning</span>
<a name="l14275"><span class="ln">14275 </span></a><span class="s0">it to any body but you, but he said you knew it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14276"><span class="ln">14276 </span></a>
<a name="l14277"><span class="ln">14277 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What did Mr. Weston tell you?&quot;--said Emma, still perplexed.</span>
<a name="l14278"><span class="ln">14278 </span></a>
<a name="l14279"><span class="ln">14279 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank</span>
<a name="l14280"><span class="ln">14280 </span></a><span class="s0">Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately</span>
<a name="l14281"><span class="ln">14281 </span></a><span class="s0">engaged to one another this long while.  How very odd!&quot;</span>
<a name="l14282"><span class="ln">14282 </span></a>
<a name="l14283"><span class="ln">14283 </span></a><span class="s0">It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,</span>
<a name="l14284"><span class="ln">14284 </span></a><span class="s0">that Emma did not know how to understand it.  Her character appeared</span>
<a name="l14285"><span class="ln">14285 </span></a><span class="s0">absolutely changed.  She seemed to propose shewing no agitation,</span>
<a name="l14286"><span class="ln">14286 </span></a><span class="s0">or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.  Emma looked</span>
<a name="l14287"><span class="ln">14287 </span></a><span class="s0">at her, quite unable to speak.</span>
<a name="l14288"><span class="ln">14288 </span></a>
<a name="l14289"><span class="ln">14289 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Had you any idea,&quot; cried Harriet, &quot;of his being in love</span>
<a name="l14290"><span class="ln">14290 </span></a><span class="s0">with her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke)</span>
<a name="l14291"><span class="ln">14291 </span></a><span class="s0">who can see into every body's heart; but nobody else--&quot;</span>
<a name="l14292"><span class="ln">14292 </span></a>
<a name="l14293"><span class="ln">14293 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon my word,&quot; said Emma, &quot;I begin to doubt my having any such talent.</span>
<a name="l14294"><span class="ln">14294 </span></a><span class="s0">Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached</span>
<a name="l14295"><span class="ln">14295 </span></a><span class="s0">to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--</span>
<a name="l14296"><span class="ln">14296 </span></a><span class="s0">encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had</span>
<a name="l14297"><span class="ln">14297 </span></a><span class="s0">the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank</span>
<a name="l14298"><span class="ln">14298 </span></a><span class="s0">Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.  You may be</span>
<a name="l14299"><span class="ln">14299 </span></a><span class="s0">very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14300"><span class="ln">14300 </span></a>
<a name="l14301"><span class="ln">14301 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Me!&quot; cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.  &quot;Why should you</span>
<a name="l14302"><span class="ln">14302 </span></a><span class="s0">caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14303"><span class="ln">14303 </span></a>
<a name="l14304"><span class="ln">14304 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,&quot;</span>
<a name="l14305"><span class="ln">14305 </span></a><span class="s0">replied Emma, smiling; &quot;but you do not mean to deny that there</span>
<a name="l14306"><span class="ln">14306 </span></a><span class="s0">was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason</span>
<a name="l14307"><span class="ln">14307 </span></a><span class="s0">to understand that you did care about him?&quot;</span>
<a name="l14308"><span class="ln">14308 </span></a>
<a name="l14309"><span class="ln">14309 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Him!--never, never.  Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?&quot;</span>
<a name="l14310"><span class="ln">14310 </span></a><span class="s0">turning away distressed.</span>
<a name="l14311"><span class="ln">14311 </span></a>
<a name="l14312"><span class="ln">14312 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Harriet!&quot; cried Emma, after a moment's pause--&quot;What do you mean?--</span>
<a name="l14313"><span class="ln">14313 </span></a><span class="s0">Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--&quot;</span>
<a name="l14314"><span class="ln">14314 </span></a>
<a name="l14315"><span class="ln">14315 </span></a><span class="s0">She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she</span>
<a name="l14316"><span class="ln">14316 </span></a><span class="s0">sat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.</span>
<a name="l14317"><span class="ln">14317 </span></a>
<a name="l14318"><span class="ln">14318 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned</span>
<a name="l14319"><span class="ln">14319 </span></a><span class="s0">from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak,</span>
<a name="l14320"><span class="ln">14320 </span></a><span class="s0">it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.</span>
<a name="l14321"><span class="ln">14321 </span></a>
<a name="l14322"><span class="ln">14322 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I should not have thought it possible,&quot; she began, &quot;that you</span>
<a name="l14323"><span class="ln">14323 </span></a><span class="s0">could have misunderstood me!  I know we agreed never to name him--</span>
<a name="l14324"><span class="ln">14324 </span></a><span class="s0">but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else,</span>
<a name="l14325"><span class="ln">14325 </span></a><span class="s0">I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed</span>
<a name="l14326"><span class="ln">14326 </span></a><span class="s0">to mean any other person.  Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!  I do not</span>
<a name="l14327"><span class="ln">14327 </span></a><span class="s0">know who would ever look at him in the company of the other.</span>
<a name="l14328"><span class="ln">14328 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill,</span>
<a name="l14329"><span class="ln">14329 </span></a><span class="s0">who is like nobody by his side.  And that you should have been</span>
<a name="l14330"><span class="ln">14330 </span></a><span class="s0">so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that you</span>
<a name="l14331"><span class="ln">14331 </span></a><span class="s0">entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment,</span>
<a name="l14332"><span class="ln">14332 </span></a><span class="s0">I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,</span>
<a name="l14333"><span class="ln">14333 </span></a><span class="s0">to dare to think of him.  At first, if you had not told me</span>
<a name="l14334"><span class="ln">14334 </span></a><span class="s0">that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been</span>
<a name="l14335"><span class="ln">14335 </span></a><span class="s0">matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);--</span>
<a name="l14336"><span class="ln">14336 </span></a><span class="s0">I should not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought</span>
<a name="l14337"><span class="ln">14337 </span></a><span class="s0">it possible--But if _you_, who had been always acquainted with him--&quot;</span>
<a name="l14338"><span class="ln">14338 </span></a>
<a name="l14339"><span class="ln">14339 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Harriet!&quot; cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--&quot;Let us</span>
<a name="l14340"><span class="ln">14340 </span></a><span class="s0">understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.</span>
<a name="l14341"><span class="ln">14341 </span></a><span class="s0">Are you speaking of--Mr. Knightley?&quot;</span>
<a name="l14342"><span class="ln">14342 </span></a>
<a name="l14343"><span class="ln">14343 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;To be sure I am.  I never could have an idea of any body else--</span>
<a name="l14344"><span class="ln">14344 </span></a><span class="s0">and so I thought you knew.  When we talked about him, it was as clear</span>
<a name="l14345"><span class="ln">14345 </span></a><span class="s0">as possible.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14346"><span class="ln">14346 </span></a>
<a name="l14347"><span class="ln">14347 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not quite,&quot; returned Emma, with forced calmness, &quot;for all that</span>
<a name="l14348"><span class="ln">14348 </span></a><span class="s0">you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.</span>
<a name="l14349"><span class="ln">14349 </span></a><span class="s0">I could almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill.</span>
<a name="l14350"><span class="ln">14350 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you,</span>
<a name="l14351"><span class="ln">14351 </span></a><span class="s0">in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14352"><span class="ln">14352 </span></a>
<a name="l14353"><span class="ln">14353 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!&quot;</span>
<a name="l14354"><span class="ln">14354 </span></a>
<a name="l14355"><span class="ln">14355 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I</span>
<a name="l14356"><span class="ln">14356 </span></a><span class="s0">said on the occasion.  I told you that I did not wonder at</span>
<a name="l14357"><span class="ln">14357 </span></a><span class="s0">your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you,</span>
<a name="l14358"><span class="ln">14358 </span></a><span class="s0">it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself</span>
<a name="l14359"><span class="ln">14359 </span></a><span class="s0">very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning</span>
<a name="l14360"><span class="ln">14360 </span></a><span class="s0">even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward</span>
<a name="l14361"><span class="ln">14361 </span></a><span class="s0">to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14362"><span class="ln">14362 </span></a>
<a name="l14363"><span class="ln">14363 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; cried Harriet, &quot;now I recollect what you mean; but I</span>
<a name="l14364"><span class="ln">14364 </span></a><span class="s0">was thinking of something very different at the time.  It was not</span>
<a name="l14365"><span class="ln">14365 </span></a><span class="s0">the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.  No! (with</span>
<a name="l14366"><span class="ln">14366 </span></a><span class="s0">some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--</span>
<a name="l14367"><span class="ln">14367 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l14368"><span class="ln">14368 </span></a><span class="s0">would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in</span>
<a name="l14369"><span class="ln">14369 </span></a><span class="s0">the room.  That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence</span>
<a name="l14370"><span class="ln">14370 </span></a><span class="s0">and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel</span>
<a name="l14371"><span class="ln">14371 </span></a><span class="s0">how superior he was to every other being upon earth.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14372"><span class="ln">14372 </span></a>
<a name="l14373"><span class="ln">14373 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Good God!&quot; cried Emma, &quot;this has been a most unfortunate--</span>
<a name="l14374"><span class="ln">14374 </span></a><span class="s0">most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?&quot;</span>
<a name="l14375"><span class="ln">14375 </span></a>
<a name="l14376"><span class="ln">14376 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me?</span>
<a name="l14377"><span class="ln">14377 </span></a><span class="s0">At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been,</span>
<a name="l14378"><span class="ln">14378 </span></a><span class="s0">if the other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--&quot;</span>
<a name="l14379"><span class="ln">14379 </span></a>
<a name="l14380"><span class="ln">14380 </span></a><span class="s0">She paused a few moments.  Emma could not speak.</span>
<a name="l14381"><span class="ln">14381 </span></a>
<a name="l14382"><span class="ln">14382 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,&quot; she resumed, &quot;that you should feel</span>
<a name="l14383"><span class="ln">14383 </span></a><span class="s0">a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body.</span>
<a name="l14384"><span class="ln">14384 </span></a><span class="s0">You must think one five hundred million times more above me than</span>
<a name="l14385"><span class="ln">14385 </span></a><span class="s0">the other.  But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--</span>
<a name="l14386"><span class="ln">14386 </span></a><span class="s0">strange as it may appear--.  But you know they were your own words,</span>
<a name="l14387"><span class="ln">14387 </span></a><span class="s0">that _more_ wonderful things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity</span>
<a name="l14388"><span class="ln">14388 </span></a><span class="s0">had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore,</span>
<a name="l14389"><span class="ln">14389 </span></a><span class="s0">it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--</span>
<a name="l14390"><span class="ln">14390 </span></a><span class="s0">and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to--</span>
<a name="l14391"><span class="ln">14391 </span></a><span class="s0">if Mr. Knightley should really--if _he_ does not mind the disparity,</span>
<a name="l14392"><span class="ln">14392 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it,</span>
<a name="l14393"><span class="ln">14393 </span></a><span class="s0">and try to put difficulties in the way.  But you are too good for that,</span>
<a name="l14394"><span class="ln">14394 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14395"><span class="ln">14395 </span></a>
<a name="l14396"><span class="ln">14396 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was standing at one of the windows.  Emma turned round</span>
<a name="l14397"><span class="ln">14397 </span></a><span class="s0">to look at her in consternation, and hastily said,</span>
<a name="l14398"><span class="ln">14398 </span></a>
<a name="l14399"><span class="ln">14399 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?&quot;</span>
<a name="l14400"><span class="ln">14400 </span></a>
<a name="l14401"><span class="ln">14401 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--&quot;I must say</span>
<a name="l14402"><span class="ln">14402 </span></a><span class="s0">that I have.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14403"><span class="ln">14403 </span></a>
<a name="l14404"><span class="ln">14404 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,</span>
<a name="l14405"><span class="ln">14405 </span></a><span class="s0">in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.  A few minutes were sufficient</span>
<a name="l14406"><span class="ln">14406 </span></a><span class="s0">for making her acquainted with her own heart.  A mind like hers,</span>
<a name="l14407"><span class="ln">14407 </span></a><span class="s0">once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.  She touched--</span>
<a name="l14408"><span class="ln">14408 </span></a><span class="s0">she admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.  Why was it</span>
<a name="l14409"><span class="ln">14409 </span></a><span class="s0">so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l14410"><span class="ln">14410 </span></a><span class="s0">than with Frank Churchill?  Why was the evil so dreadfully increased</span>
<a name="l14411"><span class="ln">14411 </span></a><span class="s0">by Harriet's having some hope of a return?  It darted through her,</span>
<a name="l14412"><span class="ln">14412 </span></a><span class="s0">with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one</span>
<a name="l14413"><span class="ln">14413 </span></a><span class="s0">but herself!</span>
<a name="l14414"><span class="ln">14414 </span></a>
<a name="l14415"><span class="ln">14415 </span></a><span class="s0">Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the</span>
<a name="l14416"><span class="ln">14416 </span></a><span class="s0">same few minutes.  She saw it all with a clearness which had</span>
<a name="l14417"><span class="ln">14417 </span></a><span class="s0">never blessed her before.  How improperly had she been acting</span>
<a name="l14418"><span class="ln">14418 </span></a><span class="s0">by Harriet!  How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational,</span>
<a name="l14419"><span class="ln">14419 </span></a><span class="s0">how unfeeling had been her conduct!  What blindness, what madness,</span>
<a name="l14420"><span class="ln">14420 </span></a><span class="s0">had led her on!  It struck her with dreadful force, and she</span>
<a name="l14421"><span class="ln">14421 </span></a><span class="s0">was ready to give it every bad name in the world.  Some portion</span>
<a name="l14422"><span class="ln">14422 </span></a><span class="s0">of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits--</span>
<a name="l14423"><span class="ln">14423 </span></a><span class="s0">some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice</span>
<a name="l14424"><span class="ln">14424 </span></a><span class="s0">by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl</span>
<a name="l14425"><span class="ln">14425 </span></a><span class="s0">who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required</span>
<a name="l14426"><span class="ln">14426 </span></a><span class="s0">that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,)</span>
<a name="l14427"><span class="ln">14427 </span></a><span class="s0">gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness,</span>
<a name="l14428"><span class="ln">14428 </span></a><span class="s0">with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit</span>
<a name="l14429"><span class="ln">14429 </span></a><span class="s0">that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into;</span>
<a name="l14430"><span class="ln">14430 </span></a><span class="s0">and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest</span>
<a name="l14431"><span class="ln">14431 </span></a><span class="s0">which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve</span>
<a name="l14432"><span class="ln">14432 </span></a><span class="s0">to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.--</span>
<a name="l14433"><span class="ln">14433 </span></a><span class="s0">Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion,</span>
<a name="l14434"><span class="ln">14434 </span></a><span class="s0">she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed</span>
<a name="l14435"><span class="ln">14435 </span></a><span class="s0">the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it,</span>
<a name="l14436"><span class="ln">14436 </span></a><span class="s0">the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.--</span>
<a name="l14437"><span class="ln">14437 </span></a><span class="s0">Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.</span>
<a name="l14438"><span class="ln">14438 </span></a>
<a name="l14439"><span class="ln">14439 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad</span>
<a name="l14440"><span class="ln">14440 </span></a><span class="s0">to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,</span>
<a name="l14441"><span class="ln">14441 </span></a><span class="s0">and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation,</span>
<a name="l14442"><span class="ln">14442 </span></a><span class="s0">to give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling</span>
<a name="l14443"><span class="ln">14443 </span></a><span class="s0">delight.--Emma's tremblings as she asked, and as she listened,</span>
<a name="l14444"><span class="ln">14444 </span></a><span class="s0">were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less.</span>
<a name="l14445"><span class="ln">14445 </span></a><span class="s0">Her voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation</span>
<a name="l14446"><span class="ln">14446 </span></a><span class="s0">that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil,</span>
<a name="l14447"><span class="ln">14447 </span></a><span class="s0">such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.--</span>
<a name="l14448"><span class="ln">14448 </span></a><span class="s0">She listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward</span>
<a name="l14449"><span class="ln">14449 </span></a><span class="s0">patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well arranged,</span>
<a name="l14450"><span class="ln">14450 </span></a><span class="s0">or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be;</span>
<a name="l14451"><span class="ln">14451 </span></a><span class="s0">but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and</span>
<a name="l14452"><span class="ln">14452 </span></a><span class="s0">tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--</span>
<a name="l14453"><span class="ln">14453 </span></a><span class="s0">especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory</span>
<a name="l14454"><span class="ln">14454 </span></a><span class="s0">brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.</span>
<a name="l14455"><span class="ln">14455 </span></a>
<a name="l14456"><span class="ln">14456 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since</span>
<a name="l14457"><span class="ln">14457 </span></a><span class="s0">those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,</span>
<a name="l14458"><span class="ln">14458 </span></a><span class="s0">found her much superior to his expectation.  From that evening,</span>
<a name="l14459"><span class="ln">14459 </span></a><span class="s0">or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her</span>
<a name="l14460"><span class="ln">14460 </span></a><span class="s0">to think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking</span>
<a name="l14461"><span class="ln">14461 </span></a><span class="s0">to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having</span>
<a name="l14462"><span class="ln">14462 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness</span>
<a name="l14463"><span class="ln">14463 </span></a><span class="s0">and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it.</span>
<a name="l14464"><span class="ln">14464 </span></a><span class="s0">When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked</span>
<a name="l14465"><span class="ln">14465 </span></a><span class="s0">by her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be</span>
<a name="l14466"><span class="ln">14466 </span></a><span class="s0">acquainted with her.  Emma knew it to have been very much the case.</span>
<a name="l14467"><span class="ln">14467 </span></a><span class="s0">She had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.--</span>
<a name="l14468"><span class="ln">14468 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him--</span>
<a name="l14469"><span class="ln">14469 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had</span>
<a name="l14470"><span class="ln">14470 </span></a><span class="s0">known of his opinion of Harriet.  He praised her for being without</span>
<a name="l14471"><span class="ln">14471 </span></a><span class="s0">art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.--</span>
<a name="l14472"><span class="ln">14472 </span></a><span class="s0">She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt</span>
<a name="l14473"><span class="ln">14473 </span></a><span class="s0">on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's memory,</span>
<a name="l14474"><span class="ln">14474 </span></a><span class="s0">many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look,</span>
<a name="l14475"><span class="ln">14475 </span></a><span class="s0">a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied,</span>
<a name="l14476"><span class="ln">14476 </span></a><span class="s0">a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,</span>
<a name="l14477"><span class="ln">14477 </span></a><span class="s0">by Emma.  Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,</span>
<a name="l14478"><span class="ln">14478 </span></a><span class="s0">and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed</span>
<a name="l14479"><span class="ln">14479 </span></a><span class="s0">undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences</span>
<a name="l14480"><span class="ln">14480 </span></a><span class="s0">to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not</span>
<a name="l14481"><span class="ln">14481 </span></a><span class="s0">without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first,</span>
<a name="l14482"><span class="ln">14482 </span></a><span class="s0">was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk</span>
<a name="l14483"><span class="ln">14483 </span></a><span class="s0">at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came,</span>
<a name="l14484"><span class="ln">14484 </span></a><span class="s0">and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from</span>
<a name="l14485"><span class="ln">14485 </span></a><span class="s0">the rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more</span>
<a name="l14486"><span class="ln">14486 </span></a><span class="s0">particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular</span>
<a name="l14487"><span class="ln">14487 </span></a><span class="s0">way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed</span>
<a name="l14488"><span class="ln">14488 </span></a><span class="s0">to be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.--</span>
<a name="l14489"><span class="ln">14489 </span></a><span class="s0">But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them,</span>
<a name="l14490"><span class="ln">14490 </span></a><span class="s0">he changed the subject, and began talking about farming:--</span>
<a name="l14491"><span class="ln">14491 </span></a><span class="s0">The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour</span>
<a name="l14492"><span class="ln">14492 </span></a><span class="s0">before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his</span>
<a name="l14493"><span class="ln">14493 </span></a><span class="s0">being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said</span>
<a name="l14494"><span class="ln">14494 </span></a><span class="s0">that he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her,</span>
<a name="l14495"><span class="ln">14495 </span></a><span class="s0">during their conversation, that though he must go to London,</span>
<a name="l14496"><span class="ln">14496 </span></a><span class="s0">it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all,</span>
<a name="l14497"><span class="ln">14497 </span></a><span class="s0">which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_.</span>
<a name="l14498"><span class="ln">14498 </span></a><span class="s0">The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one</span>
<a name="l14499"><span class="ln">14499 </span></a><span class="s0">article marked, gave her severe pain.</span>
<a name="l14500"><span class="ln">14500 </span></a>
<a name="l14501"><span class="ln">14501 </span></a><span class="s0">On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did,</span>
<a name="l14502"><span class="ln">14502 </span></a><span class="s0">after a little reflection, venture the following question.</span>
<a name="l14503"><span class="ln">14503 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Might he not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought,</span>
<a name="l14504"><span class="ln">14504 </span></a><span class="s0">into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--</span>
<a name="l14505"><span class="ln">14505 </span></a><span class="s0">he might have Mr. Martin's interest in view?  But Harriet rejected</span>
<a name="l14506"><span class="ln">14506 </span></a><span class="s0">the suspicion with spirit.</span>
<a name="l14507"><span class="ln">14507 </span></a>
<a name="l14508"><span class="ln">14508 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Martin!  No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin.</span>
<a name="l14509"><span class="ln">14509 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be</span>
<a name="l14510"><span class="ln">14510 </span></a><span class="s0">suspected of it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14511"><span class="ln">14511 </span></a>
<a name="l14512"><span class="ln">14512 </span></a><span class="s0">When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear</span>
<a name="l14513"><span class="ln">14513 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.</span>
<a name="l14514"><span class="ln">14514 </span></a>
<a name="l14515"><span class="ln">14515 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I never should have presumed to think of it at first,&quot; said she,</span>
<a name="l14516"><span class="ln">14516 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;but for you.  You told me to observe him carefully, and let</span>
<a name="l14517"><span class="ln">14517 </span></a><span class="s0">his behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have.  But now I seem</span>
<a name="l14518"><span class="ln">14518 </span></a><span class="s0">to feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me,</span>
<a name="l14519"><span class="ln">14519 </span></a><span class="s0">it will not be any thing so very wonderful.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14520"><span class="ln">14520 </span></a>
<a name="l14521"><span class="ln">14521 </span></a><span class="s0">The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter</span>
<a name="l14522"><span class="ln">14522 </span></a><span class="s0">feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side,</span>
<a name="l14523"><span class="ln">14523 </span></a><span class="s0">to enable her to say on reply,</span>
<a name="l14524"><span class="ln">14524 </span></a>
<a name="l14525"><span class="ln">14525 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is</span>
<a name="l14526"><span class="ln">14526 </span></a><span class="s0">the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman</span>
<a name="l14527"><span class="ln">14527 </span></a><span class="s0">the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14528"><span class="ln">14528 </span></a>
<a name="l14529"><span class="ln">14529 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory;</span>
<a name="l14530"><span class="ln">14530 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at</span>
<a name="l14531"><span class="ln">14531 </span></a><span class="s0">that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her</span>
<a name="l14532"><span class="ln">14532 </span></a><span class="s0">father's footsteps.  He was coming through the hall.  Harriet was</span>
<a name="l14533"><span class="ln">14533 </span></a><span class="s0">too much agitated to encounter him.  &quot;She could not compose herself--</span>
<a name="l14534"><span class="ln">14534 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;&quot;--with most ready</span>
<a name="l14535"><span class="ln">14535 </span></a><span class="s0">encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through</span>
<a name="l14536"><span class="ln">14536 </span></a><span class="s0">another door--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous</span>
<a name="l14537"><span class="ln">14537 </span></a><span class="s0">burst of Emma's feelings:  &quot;Oh God! that I had never seen her!&quot;</span>
<a name="l14538"><span class="ln">14538 </span></a>
<a name="l14539"><span class="ln">14539 </span></a><span class="s0">The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough</span>
<a name="l14540"><span class="ln">14540 </span></a><span class="s0">for her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion</span>
<a name="l14541"><span class="ln">14541 </span></a><span class="s0">of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours.</span>
<a name="l14542"><span class="ln">14542 </span></a><span class="s0">Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize</span>
<a name="l14543"><span class="ln">14543 </span></a><span class="s0">must be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all!</span>
<a name="l14544"><span class="ln">14544 </span></a><span class="s0">How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising</span>
<a name="l14545"><span class="ln">14545 </span></a><span class="s0">on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the blindness of her</span>
<a name="l14546"><span class="ln">14546 </span></a><span class="s0">own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about, she tried her</span>
<a name="l14547"><span class="ln">14547 </span></a><span class="s0">own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture,</span>
<a name="l14548"><span class="ln">14548 </span></a><span class="s0">she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed</span>
<a name="l14549"><span class="ln">14549 </span></a><span class="s0">on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing</span>
<a name="l14550"><span class="ln">14550 </span></a><span class="s0">on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched,</span>
<a name="l14551"><span class="ln">14551 </span></a><span class="s0">and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.</span>
<a name="l14552"><span class="ln">14552 </span></a>
<a name="l14553"><span class="ln">14553 </span></a><span class="s0">To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the</span>
<a name="l14554"><span class="ln">14554 </span></a><span class="s0">first endeavour.  To that point went every leisure moment which her</span>
<a name="l14555"><span class="ln">14555 </span></a><span class="s0">father's claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary</span>
<a name="l14556"><span class="ln">14556 </span></a><span class="s0">absence of mind.</span>
<a name="l14557"><span class="ln">14557 </span></a>
<a name="l14558"><span class="ln">14558 </span></a><span class="s0">How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling</span>
<a name="l14559"><span class="ln">14559 </span></a><span class="s0">declared him now to be?  When had his influence, such influence begun?--</span>
<a name="l14560"><span class="ln">14560 </span></a><span class="s0">When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank</span>
<a name="l14561"><span class="ln">14561 </span></a><span class="s0">Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;</span>
<a name="l14562"><span class="ln">14562 </span></a><span class="s0">she compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in</span>
<a name="l14563"><span class="ln">14563 </span></a><span class="s0">her estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her--</span>
<a name="l14564"><span class="ln">14564 </span></a><span class="s0">and as they must at any time have been compared by her, had it--</span>
<a name="l14565"><span class="ln">14565 </span></a><span class="s0">oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute</span>
<a name="l14566"><span class="ln">14566 </span></a><span class="s0">the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she</span>
<a name="l14567"><span class="ln">14567 </span></a><span class="s0">did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when</span>
<a name="l14568"><span class="ln">14568 </span></a><span class="s0">his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear.  She saw,</span>
<a name="l14569"><span class="ln">14569 </span></a><span class="s0">that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary,</span>
<a name="l14570"><span class="ln">14570 </span></a><span class="s0">she had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her</span>
<a name="l14571"><span class="ln">14571 </span></a><span class="s0">own heart--and, in short, that she had never really cared for Frank</span>
<a name="l14572"><span class="ln">14572 </span></a><span class="s0">Churchill at all!</span>
<a name="l14573"><span class="ln">14573 </span></a>
<a name="l14574"><span class="ln">14574 </span></a><span class="s0">This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection.</span>
<a name="l14575"><span class="ln">14575 </span></a><span class="s0">This was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry,</span>
<a name="l14576"><span class="ln">14576 </span></a><span class="s0">which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.--</span>
<a name="l14577"><span class="ln">14577 </span></a><span class="s0">She was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation</span>
<a name="l14578"><span class="ln">14578 </span></a><span class="s0">but the one revealed to her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--</span>
<a name="l14579"><span class="ln">14579 </span></a><span class="s0">Every other part of her mind was disgusting.</span>
<a name="l14580"><span class="ln">14580 </span></a>
<a name="l14581"><span class="ln">14581 </span></a><span class="s0">With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every</span>
<a name="l14582"><span class="ln">14582 </span></a><span class="s0">body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every</span>
<a name="l14583"><span class="ln">14583 </span></a><span class="s0">body's destiny.  She was proved to have been universally mistaken;</span>
<a name="l14584"><span class="ln">14584 </span></a><span class="s0">and she had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief.</span>
<a name="l14585"><span class="ln">14585 </span></a><span class="s0">She had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared,</span>
<a name="l14586"><span class="ln">14586 </span></a><span class="s0">on Mr. Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to</span>
<a name="l14587"><span class="ln">14587 </span></a><span class="s0">take place, on her must rest all the reproach of having given it</span>
<a name="l14588"><span class="ln">14588 </span></a><span class="s0">a beginning; for his attachment, she must believe to be produced only</span>
<a name="l14589"><span class="ln">14589 </span></a><span class="s0">by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case,</span>
<a name="l14590"><span class="ln">14590 </span></a><span class="s0">he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly.</span>
<a name="l14591"><span class="ln">14591 </span></a>
<a name="l14592"><span class="ln">14592 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every</span>
<a name="l14593"><span class="ln">14593 </span></a><span class="s0">wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane</span>
<a name="l14594"><span class="ln">14594 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison,</span>
<a name="l14595"><span class="ln">14595 </span></a><span class="s0">exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing</span>
<a name="l14596"><span class="ln">14596 </span></a><span class="s0">to be said or thought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an</span>
<a name="l14597"><span class="ln">14597 </span></a><span class="s0">elevation on her side!  Such a debasement on his!  It was horrible</span>
<a name="l14598"><span class="ln">14598 </span></a><span class="s0">to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion,</span>
<a name="l14599"><span class="ln">14599 </span></a><span class="s0">to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at</span>
<a name="l14600"><span class="ln">14600 </span></a><span class="s0">his expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the thousand</span>
<a name="l14601"><span class="ln">14601 </span></a><span class="s0">inconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No; it was impossible.</span>
<a name="l14602"><span class="ln">14602 </span></a><span class="s0">And yet it was far, very far, from impossible.--Was it a new</span>
<a name="l14603"><span class="ln">14603 </span></a><span class="s0">circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by</span>
<a name="l14604"><span class="ln">14604 </span></a><span class="s0">very inferior powers?  Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to seek,</span>
<a name="l14605"><span class="ln">14605 </span></a><span class="s0">to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was it new for any</span>
<a name="l14606"><span class="ln">14606 </span></a><span class="s0">thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent, incongruous--or for</span>
<a name="l14607"><span class="ln">14607 </span></a><span class="s0">chance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct the human fate?</span>
<a name="l14608"><span class="ln">14608 </span></a>
<a name="l14609"><span class="ln">14609 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward!  Had she left her where</span>
<a name="l14610"><span class="ln">14610 </span></a><span class="s0">she ought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not,</span>
<a name="l14611"><span class="ln">14611 </span></a><span class="s0">with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying</span>
<a name="l14612"><span class="ln">14612 </span></a><span class="s0">the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy</span>
<a name="l14613"><span class="ln">14613 </span></a><span class="s0">and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong--</span>
<a name="l14614"><span class="ln">14614 </span></a><span class="s0">all would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.</span>
<a name="l14615"><span class="ln">14615 </span></a>
<a name="l14616"><span class="ln">14616 </span></a><span class="s0">How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise</span>
<a name="l14617"><span class="ln">14617 </span></a><span class="s0">her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy</span>
<a name="l14618"><span class="ln">14618 </span></a><span class="s0">herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!--</span>
<a name="l14619"><span class="ln">14619 </span></a><span class="s0">But Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.--</span>
<a name="l14620"><span class="ln">14620 </span></a><span class="s0">Her inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.--</span>
<a name="l14621"><span class="ln">14621 </span></a><span class="s0">She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop</span>
<a name="l14622"><span class="ln">14622 </span></a><span class="s0">in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.--</span>
<a name="l14623"><span class="ln">14623 </span></a><span class="s0">Alas! was not that her own doing too?  Who had been at pains to give</span>
<a name="l14624"><span class="ln">14624 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but herself</span>
<a name="l14625"><span class="ln">14625 </span></a><span class="s0">had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,</span>
<a name="l14626"><span class="ln">14626 </span></a><span class="s0">and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--</span>
<a name="l14627"><span class="ln">14627 </span></a><span class="s0">If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.</span>
<a name="l14628"><span class="ln">14628 </span></a>

<a name="l14632"><span class="ln">14632 </span></a>
<a name="l14633"><span class="ln">14633 </span></a>
<a name="l14634"><span class="ln">14634 </span></a><span class="s0">Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known</span>
<a name="l14635"><span class="ln">14635 </span></a><span class="s0">how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l14636"><span class="ln">14636 </span></a><span class="s0">first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so,</span>
<a name="l14637"><span class="ln">14637 </span></a><span class="s0">and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection;</span>
<a name="l14638"><span class="ln">14638 </span></a><span class="s0">and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly</span>
<a name="l14639"><span class="ln">14639 </span></a><span class="s0">important it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first;</span>
<a name="l14640"><span class="ln">14640 </span></a><span class="s0">for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been</span>
<a name="l14641"><span class="ln">14641 </span></a><span class="s0">only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she</span>
<a name="l14642"><span class="ln">14642 </span></a><span class="s0">had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella.</span>
<a name="l14643"><span class="ln">14643 </span></a><span class="s0">She had herself been first with him for many years past.</span>
<a name="l14644"><span class="ln">14644 </span></a><span class="s0">She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse,</span>
<a name="l14645"><span class="ln">14645 </span></a><span class="s0">slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of</span>
<a name="l14646"><span class="ln">14646 </span></a><span class="s0">half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not</span>
<a name="l14647"><span class="ln">14647 </span></a><span class="s0">acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,</span>
<a name="l14648"><span class="ln">14648 </span></a><span class="s0">from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind,</span>
<a name="l14649"><span class="ln">14649 </span></a><span class="s0">he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour</span>
<a name="l14650"><span class="ln">14650 </span></a><span class="s0">to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no</span>
<a name="l14651"><span class="ln">14651 </span></a><span class="s0">other creature had at all shared.  In spite of all her faults,</span>
<a name="l14652"><span class="ln">14652 </span></a><span class="s0">she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?--</span>
<a name="l14653"><span class="ln">14653 </span></a><span class="s0">When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here,</span>
<a name="l14654"><span class="ln">14654 </span></a><span class="s0">presented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them.</span>
<a name="l14655"><span class="ln">14655 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly,</span>
<a name="l14656"><span class="ln">14656 </span></a><span class="s0">exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.  _She_ could not.</span>
<a name="l14657"><span class="ln">14657 </span></a><span class="s0">She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment</span>
<a name="l14658"><span class="ln">14658 </span></a><span class="s0">to _her_.  She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.--</span>
<a name="l14659"><span class="ln">14659 </span></a><span class="s0">How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates!  How directly,</span>
<a name="l14660"><span class="ln">14660 </span></a><span class="s0">how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not too</span>
<a name="l14661"><span class="ln">14661 </span></a><span class="s0">strongly for the offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from</span>
<a name="l14662"><span class="ln">14662 </span></a><span class="s0">any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.--</span>
<a name="l14663"><span class="ln">14663 </span></a><span class="s0">She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could</span>
<a name="l14664"><span class="ln">14664 </span></a><span class="s0">have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question;</span>
<a name="l14665"><span class="ln">14665 </span></a><span class="s0">but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,)</span>
<a name="l14666"><span class="ln">14666 </span></a><span class="s0">that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his</span>
<a name="l14667"><span class="ln">14667 </span></a><span class="s0">regard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the consequence</span>
<a name="l14668"><span class="ln">14668 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.</span>
<a name="l14669"><span class="ln">14669 </span></a><span class="s0">Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all,</span>
<a name="l14670"><span class="ln">14670 </span></a><span class="s0">she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue</span>
<a name="l14671"><span class="ln">14671 </span></a><span class="s0">the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l14672"><span class="ln">14672 </span></a><span class="s0">to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their</span>
<a name="l14673"><span class="ln">14673 </span></a><span class="s0">precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace</span>
<a name="l14674"><span class="ln">14674 </span></a><span class="s0">would be fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her.</span>
<a name="l14675"><span class="ln">14675 </span></a><span class="s0">It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with</span>
<a name="l14676"><span class="ln">14676 </span></a><span class="s0">what she felt for him.  Nothing should separate her from her father.</span>
<a name="l14677"><span class="ln">14677 </span></a><span class="s0">She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l14678"><span class="ln">14678 </span></a>
<a name="l14679"><span class="ln">14679 </span></a><span class="s0">It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed;</span>
<a name="l14680"><span class="ln">14680 </span></a><span class="s0">and she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at</span>
<a name="l14681"><span class="ln">14681 </span></a><span class="s0">least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should</span>
<a name="l14682"><span class="ln">14682 </span></a><span class="s0">see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly</span>
<a name="l14683"><span class="ln">14683 </span></a><span class="s0">as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching,</span>
<a name="l14684"><span class="ln">14684 </span></a><span class="s0">she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.--</span>
<a name="l14685"><span class="ln">14685 </span></a><span class="s0">He was expected back every day.  The power of observation would be</span>
<a name="l14686"><span class="ln">14686 </span></a><span class="s0">soon given--frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in</span>
<a name="l14687"><span class="ln">14687 </span></a><span class="s0">one course.  In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.--</span>
<a name="l14688"><span class="ln">14688 </span></a><span class="s0">It would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good,</span>
<a name="l14689"><span class="ln">14689 </span></a><span class="s0">to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced,</span>
<a name="l14690"><span class="ln">14690 </span></a><span class="s0">as long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing</span>
<a name="l14691"><span class="ln">14691 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's confidence.  To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote</span>
<a name="l14692"><span class="ln">14692 </span></a><span class="s0">to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not,</span>
<a name="l14693"><span class="ln">14693 </span></a><span class="s0">at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction,</span>
<a name="l14694"><span class="ln">14694 </span></a><span class="s0">that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better</span>
<a name="l14695"><span class="ln">14695 </span></a><span class="s0">be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before</span>
<a name="l14696"><span class="ln">14696 </span></a><span class="s0">they met again, except in the company of others--she objected only</span>
<a name="l14697"><span class="ln">14697 </span></a><span class="s0">to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten</span>
<a name="l14698"><span class="ln">14698 </span></a><span class="s0">the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved,</span>
<a name="l14699"><span class="ln">14699 </span></a><span class="s0">and was grateful.</span>
<a name="l14700"><span class="ln">14700 </span></a>
<a name="l14701"><span class="ln">14701 </span></a><span class="s0">This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's</span>
<a name="l14702"><span class="ln">14702 </span></a><span class="s0">thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,</span>
<a name="l14703"><span class="ln">14703 </span></a><span class="s0">sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had</span>
<a name="l14704"><span class="ln">14704 </span></a><span class="s0">been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her</span>
<a name="l14705"><span class="ln">14705 </span></a><span class="s0">way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself,</span>
<a name="l14706"><span class="ln">14706 </span></a><span class="s0">to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.</span>
<a name="l14707"><span class="ln">14707 </span></a>
<a name="l14708"><span class="ln">14708 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his</span>
<a name="l14709"><span class="ln">14709 </span></a><span class="s0">share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having</span>
<a name="l14710"><span class="ln">14710 </span></a><span class="s0">then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned</span>
<a name="l14711"><span class="ln">14711 </span></a><span class="s0">with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction,</span>
<a name="l14712"><span class="ln">14712 </span></a><span class="s0">than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all</span>
<a name="l14713"><span class="ln">14713 </span></a><span class="s0">the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.</span>
<a name="l14714"><span class="ln">14714 </span></a>
<a name="l14715"><span class="ln">14715 </span></a><span class="s0">A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while</span>
<a name="l14716"><span class="ln">14716 </span></a><span class="s0">her friend related.  Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit</span>
<a name="l14717"><span class="ln">14717 </span></a><span class="s0">in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had</span>
<a name="l14718"><span class="ln">14718 </span></a><span class="s0">wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write</span>
<a name="l14719"><span class="ln">14719 </span></a><span class="s0">to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till</span>
<a name="l14720"><span class="ln">14720 </span></a><span class="s0">a little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled</span>
<a name="l14721"><span class="ln">14721 </span></a><span class="s0">to the engagement's becoming known; as, considering every thing,</span>
<a name="l14722"><span class="ln">14722 </span></a><span class="s0">she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:--</span>
<a name="l14723"><span class="ln">14723 </span></a><span class="s0">but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious</span>
<a name="l14724"><span class="ln">14724 </span></a><span class="s0">to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not</span>
<a name="l14725"><span class="ln">14725 </span></a><span class="s0">conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were,</span>
<a name="l14726"><span class="ln">14726 </span></a><span class="s0">that it would be of any consequence; for &quot;such things,&quot; he observed,</span>
<a name="l14727"><span class="ln">14727 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;always got about.&quot;  Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had</span>
<a name="l14728"><span class="ln">14728 </span></a><span class="s0">very good reason for saying so.  They had gone, in short--and very</span>
<a name="l14729"><span class="ln">14729 </span></a><span class="s0">great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady.</span>
<a name="l14730"><span class="ln">14730 </span></a><span class="s0">She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action</span>
<a name="l14731"><span class="ln">14731 </span></a><span class="s0">had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.  The quiet,</span>
<a name="l14732"><span class="ln">14732 </span></a><span class="s0">heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight</span>
<a name="l14733"><span class="ln">14733 </span></a><span class="s0">of her daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,</span>
<a name="l14734"><span class="ln">14734 </span></a><span class="s0">had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.  They were</span>
<a name="l14735"><span class="ln">14735 </span></a><span class="s0">both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested</span>
<a name="l14736"><span class="ln">14736 </span></a><span class="s0">in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body,</span>
<a name="l14737"><span class="ln">14737 </span></a><span class="s0">and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work</span>
<a name="l14738"><span class="ln">14738 </span></a><span class="s0">for them.  Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea</span>
<a name="l14739"><span class="ln">14739 </span></a><span class="s0">for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and</span>
<a name="l14740"><span class="ln">14740 </span></a><span class="s0">declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the</span>
<a name="l14741"><span class="ln">14741 </span></a><span class="s0">course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,</span>
<a name="l14742"><span class="ln">14742 </span></a><span class="s0">overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse</span>
<a name="l14743"><span class="ln">14743 </span></a><span class="s0">on the important subject.  Apologies for her seemingly ungracious</span>
<a name="l14744"><span class="ln">14744 </span></a><span class="s0">silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the</span>
<a name="l14745"><span class="ln">14745 </span></a><span class="s0">gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston,</span>
<a name="l14746"><span class="ln">14746 </span></a><span class="s0">must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by,</span>
<a name="l14747"><span class="ln">14747 </span></a><span class="s0">they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state</span>
<a name="l14748"><span class="ln">14748 </span></a><span class="s0">of the engagement.  Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation</span>
<a name="l14749"><span class="ln">14749 </span></a><span class="s0">must be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own</span>
<a name="l14750"><span class="ln">14750 </span></a><span class="s0">mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased</span>
<a name="l14751"><span class="ln">14751 </span></a><span class="s0">with all that she had said on the subject.</span>
<a name="l14752"><span class="ln">14752 </span></a>
<a name="l14753"><span class="ln">14753 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment</span>
<a name="l14754"><span class="ln">14754 </span></a><span class="s0">of so many months,&quot; continued Mrs. Weston, &quot;she was energetic.</span>
<a name="l14755"><span class="ln">14755 </span></a><span class="s0">This was one of her expressions.  `I will not say, that since I</span>
<a name="l14756"><span class="ln">14756 </span></a><span class="s0">entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I</span>
<a name="l14757"><span class="ln">14757 </span></a><span class="s0">can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--</span>
<a name="l14758"><span class="ln">14758 </span></a><span class="s0">and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation</span>
<a name="l14759"><span class="ln">14759 </span></a><span class="s0">that I felt at my heart.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14760"><span class="ln">14760 </span></a>
<a name="l14761"><span class="ln">14761 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Poor girl!&quot; said Emma.  &quot;She thinks herself wrong, then, for having</span>
<a name="l14762"><span class="ln">14762 </span></a><span class="s0">consented to a private engagement?&quot;</span>
<a name="l14763"><span class="ln">14763 </span></a>
<a name="l14764"><span class="ln">14764 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Wrong!  No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed</span>
<a name="l14765"><span class="ln">14765 </span></a><span class="s0">to blame herself.  `The consequence,' said she, `has been a state</span>
<a name="l14766"><span class="ln">14766 </span></a><span class="s0">of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought.  But after all the</span>
<a name="l14767"><span class="ln">14767 </span></a><span class="s0">punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.</span>
<a name="l14768"><span class="ln">14768 </span></a><span class="s0">Pain is no expiation.  I never can be blameless.  I have been acting</span>
<a name="l14769"><span class="ln">14769 </span></a><span class="s0">contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every</span>
<a name="l14770"><span class="ln">14770 </span></a><span class="s0">thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my</span>
<a name="l14771"><span class="ln">14771 </span></a><span class="s0">conscience tells me ought not to be.'  `Do not imagine, madam,'</span>
<a name="l14772"><span class="ln">14772 </span></a><span class="s0">she continued, `that I was taught wrong.  Do not let any reflection</span>
<a name="l14773"><span class="ln">14773 </span></a><span class="s0">fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought</span>
<a name="l14774"><span class="ln">14774 </span></a><span class="s0">me up.  The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that,</span>
<a name="l14775"><span class="ln">14775 </span></a><span class="s0">with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give,</span>
<a name="l14776"><span class="ln">14776 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'&quot;</span>
<a name="l14777"><span class="ln">14777 </span></a>
<a name="l14778"><span class="ln">14778 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Poor girl!&quot; said Emma again.  &quot;She loves him then excessively,</span>
<a name="l14779"><span class="ln">14779 </span></a><span class="s0">I suppose.  It must have been from attachment only, that she could</span>
<a name="l14780"><span class="ln">14780 </span></a><span class="s0">be led to form the engagement.  Her affection must have overpowered</span>
<a name="l14781"><span class="ln">14781 </span></a><span class="s0">her judgment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14782"><span class="ln">14782 </span></a>
<a name="l14783"><span class="ln">14783 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14784"><span class="ln">14784 </span></a>
<a name="l14785"><span class="ln">14785 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am afraid,&quot; returned Emma, sighing, &quot;that I must often have</span>
<a name="l14786"><span class="ln">14786 </span></a><span class="s0">contributed to make her unhappy.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14787"><span class="ln">14787 </span></a>
<a name="l14788"><span class="ln">14788 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.  But she</span>
<a name="l14789"><span class="ln">14789 </span></a><span class="s0">probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding</span>
<a name="l14790"><span class="ln">14790 </span></a><span class="s0">to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before.</span>
<a name="l14791"><span class="ln">14791 </span></a><span class="s0">One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,&quot;</span>
<a name="l14792"><span class="ln">14792 </span></a><span class="s0">she said, &quot;was that of making her _unreasonable_.  The consciousness</span>
<a name="l14793"><span class="ln">14793 </span></a><span class="s0">of having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes,</span>
<a name="l14794"><span class="ln">14794 </span></a><span class="s0">and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been--</span>
<a name="l14795"><span class="ln">14795 </span></a><span class="s0">that had been--hard for him to bear.  `I did not make the allowances,'</span>
<a name="l14796"><span class="ln">14796 </span></a><span class="s0">said she, `which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits--</span>
<a name="l14797"><span class="ln">14797 </span></a><span class="s0">his delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness</span>
<a name="l14798"><span class="ln">14798 </span></a><span class="s0">of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure,</span>
<a name="l14799"><span class="ln">14799 </span></a><span class="s0">have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.'</span>
<a name="l14800"><span class="ln">14800 </span></a><span class="s0">She then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you</span>
<a name="l14801"><span class="ln">14801 </span></a><span class="s0">had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me</span>
<a name="l14802"><span class="ln">14802 </span></a><span class="s0">how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity,</span>
<a name="l14803"><span class="ln">14803 </span></a><span class="s0">to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every wish and</span>
<a name="l14804"><span class="ln">14804 </span></a><span class="s0">every endeavour to do her good.  She was sensible that you had never</span>
<a name="l14805"><span class="ln">14805 </span></a><span class="s0">received any proper acknowledgment from herself.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14806"><span class="ln">14806 </span></a>
<a name="l14807"><span class="ln">14807 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If I did not know her to be happy now,&quot; said Emma, seriously,</span>
<a name="l14808"><span class="ln">14808 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous</span>
<a name="l14809"><span class="ln">14809 </span></a><span class="s0">conscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh!</span>
<a name="l14810"><span class="ln">14810 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil</span>
<a name="l14811"><span class="ln">14811 </span></a><span class="s0">and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking herself,</span>
<a name="l14812"><span class="ln">14812 </span></a><span class="s0">and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten.</span>
<a name="l14813"><span class="ln">14813 </span></a><span class="s0">You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars.</span>
<a name="l14814"><span class="ln">14814 </span></a><span class="s0">They shew her to the greatest advantage.  I am sure she is very good--</span>
<a name="l14815"><span class="ln">14815 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope she will be very happy.  It is fit that the fortune</span>
<a name="l14816"><span class="ln">14816 </span></a><span class="s0">should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14817"><span class="ln">14817 </span></a>
<a name="l14818"><span class="ln">14818 </span></a><span class="s0">Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston.</span>
<a name="l14819"><span class="ln">14819 </span></a><span class="s0">She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more,</span>
<a name="l14820"><span class="ln">14820 </span></a><span class="s0">she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.</span>
<a name="l14821"><span class="ln">14821 </span></a><span class="s0">She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--</span>
<a name="l14822"><span class="ln">14822 </span></a><span class="s0">but she had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone</span>
<a name="l14823"><span class="ln">14823 </span></a><span class="s0">to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen;</span>
<a name="l14824"><span class="ln">14824 </span></a><span class="s0">and when Mrs. Weston ended with, &quot;We have not yet had the letter</span>
<a name="l14825"><span class="ln">14825 </span></a><span class="s0">we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,&quot;</span>
<a name="l14826"><span class="ln">14826 </span></a><span class="s0">she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged</span>
<a name="l14827"><span class="ln">14827 </span></a><span class="s0">to answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it</span>
<a name="l14828"><span class="ln">14828 </span></a><span class="s0">was which they were so anxious for.</span>
<a name="l14829"><span class="ln">14829 </span></a>
<a name="l14830"><span class="ln">14830 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Are you well, my Emma?&quot; was Mrs. Weston's parting question.</span>
<a name="l14831"><span class="ln">14831 </span></a>
<a name="l14832"><span class="ln">14832 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! perfectly.  I am always well, you know.  Be sure to give me</span>
<a name="l14833"><span class="ln">14833 </span></a><span class="s0">intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14834"><span class="ln">14834 </span></a>
<a name="l14835"><span class="ln">14835 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for</span>
<a name="l14836"><span class="ln">14836 </span></a><span class="s0">unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion,</span>
<a name="l14837"><span class="ln">14837 </span></a><span class="s0">and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax.  She bitterly</span>
<a name="l14838"><span class="ln">14838 </span></a><span class="s0">regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed</span>
<a name="l14839"><span class="ln">14839 </span></a><span class="s0">for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure,</span>
<a name="l14840"><span class="ln">14840 </span></a><span class="s0">the cause.  Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying</span>
<a name="l14841"><span class="ln">14841 </span></a><span class="s0">that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she</span>
<a name="l14842"><span class="ln">14842 </span></a><span class="s0">tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy;</span>
<a name="l14843"><span class="ln">14843 </span></a><span class="s0">had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith;</span>
<a name="l14844"><span class="ln">14844 </span></a><span class="s0">she must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain</span>
<a name="l14845"><span class="ln">14845 </span></a><span class="s0">which pressed on her now.--Birth, abilities, and education,</span>
<a name="l14846"><span class="ln">14846 </span></a><span class="s0">had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received</span>
<a name="l14847"><span class="ln">14847 </span></a><span class="s0">with gratitude; and the other--what was she?--Supposing even that</span>
<a name="l14848"><span class="ln">14848 </span></a><span class="s0">they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been</span>
<a name="l14849"><span class="ln">14849 </span></a><span class="s0">admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter--</span>
<a name="l14850"><span class="ln">14850 </span></a><span class="s0">which was most probable--still, in knowing her as she ought,</span>
<a name="l14851"><span class="ln">14851 </span></a><span class="s0">and as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable</span>
<a name="l14852"><span class="ln">14852 </span></a><span class="s0">suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had</span>
<a name="l14853"><span class="ln">14853 </span></a><span class="s0">not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so</span>
<a name="l14854"><span class="ln">14854 </span></a><span class="s0">unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made</span>
<a name="l14855"><span class="ln">14855 </span></a><span class="s0">a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings,</span>
<a name="l14856"><span class="ln">14856 </span></a><span class="s0">by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's.  Of all the sources</span>
<a name="l14857"><span class="ln">14857 </span></a><span class="s0">of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury,</span>
<a name="l14858"><span class="ln">14858 </span></a><span class="s0">she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst.</span>
<a name="l14859"><span class="ln">14859 </span></a><span class="s0">She must have been a perpetual enemy.  They never could have been</span>
<a name="l14860"><span class="ln">14860 </span></a><span class="s0">all three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace</span>
<a name="l14861"><span class="ln">14861 </span></a><span class="s0">in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been</span>
<a name="l14862"><span class="ln">14862 </span></a><span class="s0">the agony of a mind that would bear no more.</span>
<a name="l14863"><span class="ln">14863 </span></a>
<a name="l14864"><span class="ln">14864 </span></a><span class="s0">The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l14865"><span class="ln">14865 </span></a><span class="s0">The weather added what it could of gloom.  A cold stormy rain set in,</span>
<a name="l14866"><span class="ln">14866 </span></a><span class="s0">and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the</span>
<a name="l14867"><span class="ln">14867 </span></a><span class="s0">wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made</span>
<a name="l14868"><span class="ln">14868 </span></a><span class="s0">such cruel sights the longer visible.</span>
<a name="l14869"><span class="ln">14869 </span></a>
<a name="l14870"><span class="ln">14870 </span></a><span class="s0">The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably</span>
<a name="l14871"><span class="ln">14871 </span></a><span class="s0">comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side,</span>
<a name="l14872"><span class="ln">14872 </span></a><span class="s0">and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before.</span>
<a name="l14873"><span class="ln">14873 </span></a><span class="s0">It reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening</span>
<a name="l14874"><span class="ln">14874 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked</span>
<a name="l14875"><span class="ln">14875 </span></a><span class="s0">in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy.</span>
<a name="l14876"><span class="ln">14876 </span></a><span class="s0">Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those</span>
<a name="l14877"><span class="ln">14877 </span></a><span class="s0">sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over.  The picture which</span>
<a name="l14878"><span class="ln">14878 </span></a><span class="s0">she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter,</span>
<a name="l14879"><span class="ln">14879 </span></a><span class="s0">had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures</span>
<a name="l14880"><span class="ln">14880 </span></a><span class="s0">had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared would</span>
<a name="l14881"><span class="ln">14881 </span></a><span class="s0">experience no similar contradiction.  The prospect before her now,</span>
<a name="l14882"><span class="ln">14882 </span></a><span class="s0">was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--</span>
<a name="l14883"><span class="ln">14883 </span></a><span class="s0">that might not be even partially brightened.  If all took place</span>
<a name="l14884"><span class="ln">14884 </span></a><span class="s0">that might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must</span>
<a name="l14885"><span class="ln">14885 </span></a><span class="s0">be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the</span>
<a name="l14886"><span class="ln">14886 </span></a><span class="s0">spirits only of ruined happiness.</span>
<a name="l14887"><span class="ln">14887 </span></a>
<a name="l14888"><span class="ln">14888 </span></a><span class="s0">The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer</span>
<a name="l14889"><span class="ln">14889 </span></a><span class="s0">than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied</span>
<a name="l14890"><span class="ln">14890 </span></a><span class="s0">by it.  They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure,</span>
<a name="l14891"><span class="ln">14891 </span></a><span class="s0">her husband also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more;</span>
<a name="l14892"><span class="ln">14892 </span></a><span class="s0">and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease</span>
<a name="l14893"><span class="ln">14893 </span></a><span class="s0">to belong to Highbury.  They would be married, and settled either</span>
<a name="l14894"><span class="ln">14894 </span></a><span class="s0">at or near Enscombe.  All that were good would be withdrawn; and if</span>
<a name="l14895"><span class="ln">14895 </span></a><span class="s0">to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would</span>
<a name="l14896"><span class="ln">14896 </span></a><span class="s0">remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach?</span>
<a name="l14897"><span class="ln">14897 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!--</span>
<a name="l14898"><span class="ln">14898 </span></a><span class="s0">No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change</span>
<a name="l14899"><span class="ln">14899 </span></a><span class="s0">his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured?  And if he were</span>
<a name="l14900"><span class="ln">14900 </span></a><span class="s0">to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought</span>
<a name="l14901"><span class="ln">14901 </span></a><span class="s0">of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he wanted;</span>
<a name="l14902"><span class="ln">14902 </span></a><span class="s0">if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend,</span>
<a name="l14903"><span class="ln">14903 </span></a><span class="s0">the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence;</span>
<a name="l14904"><span class="ln">14904 </span></a><span class="s0">what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection never far</span>
<a name="l14905"><span class="ln">14905 </span></a><span class="s0">distant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?</span>
<a name="l14906"><span class="ln">14906 </span></a>
<a name="l14907"><span class="ln">14907 </span></a><span class="s0">When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain</span>
<a name="l14908"><span class="ln">14908 </span></a><span class="s0">from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room</span>
<a name="l14909"><span class="ln">14909 </span></a><span class="s0">for a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation</span>
<a name="l14910"><span class="ln">14910 </span></a><span class="s0">or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own</span>
<a name="l14911"><span class="ln">14911 </span></a><span class="s0">better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and</span>
<a name="l14912"><span class="ln">14912 </span></a><span class="s0">gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life</span>
<a name="l14913"><span class="ln">14913 </span></a><span class="s0">to the past, it would yet find her more rational, more acquainted</span>
<a name="l14914"><span class="ln">14914 </span></a><span class="s0">with herself, and leave her less to regret when it were gone.</span>
<a name="l14915"><span class="ln">14915 </span></a>

<a name="l14920"><span class="ln">14920 </span></a>
<a name="l14921"><span class="ln">14921 </span></a><span class="s0">The weather continued much the same all the following morning;</span>
<a name="l14922"><span class="ln">14922 </span></a><span class="s0">and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to</span>
<a name="l14923"><span class="ln">14923 </span></a><span class="s0">reign at Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind</span>
<a name="l14924"><span class="ln">14924 </span></a><span class="s0">changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off;</span>
<a name="l14925"><span class="ln">14925 </span></a><span class="s0">the sun appeared; it was summer again.  With all the eagerness</span>
<a name="l14926"><span class="ln">14926 </span></a><span class="s0">which such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors</span>
<a name="l14927"><span class="ln">14927 </span></a><span class="s0">as soon as possible.  Never had the exquisite sight, smell,</span>
<a name="l14928"><span class="ln">14928 </span></a><span class="s0">sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm,</span>
<a name="l14929"><span class="ln">14929 </span></a><span class="s0">been more attractive to her.  She longed for the serenity they might</span>
<a name="l14930"><span class="ln">14930 </span></a><span class="s0">gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after dinner,</span>
<a name="l14931"><span class="ln">14931 </span></a><span class="s0">with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time ill</span>
<a name="l14932"><span class="ln">14932 </span></a><span class="s0">hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened,</span>
<a name="l14933"><span class="ln">14933 </span></a><span class="s0">and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she</span>
<a name="l14934"><span class="ln">14934 </span></a><span class="s0">saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming</span>
<a name="l14935"><span class="ln">14935 </span></a><span class="s0">towards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned</span>
<a name="l14936"><span class="ln">14936 </span></a><span class="s0">from London.  She had been thinking of him the moment before,</span>
<a name="l14937"><span class="ln">14937 </span></a><span class="s0">as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for</span>
<a name="l14938"><span class="ln">14938 </span></a><span class="s0">the quickest arrangement of mind.  She must be collected and calm.</span>
<a name="l14939"><span class="ln">14939 </span></a><span class="s0">In half a minute they were together.  The &quot;How d'ye do's&quot; were quiet</span>
<a name="l14940"><span class="ln">14940 </span></a><span class="s0">and constrained on each side.  She asked after their mutual friends;</span>
<a name="l14941"><span class="ln">14941 </span></a><span class="s0">they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning.</span>
<a name="l14942"><span class="ln">14942 </span></a><span class="s0">He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her,</span>
<a name="l14943"><span class="ln">14943 </span></a><span class="s0">she found.  &quot;He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he</span>
<a name="l14944"><span class="ln">14944 </span></a><span class="s0">was not wanted there, preferred being out of doors.&quot;--She thought</span>
<a name="l14945"><span class="ln">14945 </span></a><span class="s0">he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible</span>
<a name="l14946"><span class="ln">14946 </span></a><span class="s0">cause for it, suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been</span>
<a name="l14947"><span class="ln">14947 </span></a><span class="s0">communicating his plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner</span>
<a name="l14948"><span class="ln">14948 </span></a><span class="s0">in which they had been received.</span>
<a name="l14949"><span class="ln">14949 </span></a>
<a name="l14950"><span class="ln">14950 </span></a><span class="s0">They walked together.  He was silent.  She thought he was often</span>
<a name="l14951"><span class="ln">14951 </span></a><span class="s0">looking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it</span>
<a name="l14952"><span class="ln">14952 </span></a><span class="s0">suited her to give.  And this belief produced another dread.</span>
<a name="l14953"><span class="ln">14953 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet;</span>
<a name="l14954"><span class="ln">14954 </span></a><span class="s0">he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not,</span>
<a name="l14955"><span class="ln">14955 </span></a><span class="s0">could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject.</span>
<a name="l14956"><span class="ln">14956 </span></a><span class="s0">He must do it all himself.  Yet she could not bear this silence.</span>
<a name="l14957"><span class="ln">14957 </span></a><span class="s0">With him it was most unnatural.  She considered--resolved--and, trying</span>
<a name="l14958"><span class="ln">14958 </span></a><span class="s0">to smile, began--</span>
<a name="l14959"><span class="ln">14959 </span></a>
<a name="l14960"><span class="ln">14960 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather</span>
<a name="l14961"><span class="ln">14961 </span></a><span class="s0">surprize you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14962"><span class="ln">14962 </span></a>
<a name="l14963"><span class="ln">14963 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Have I?&quot; said he quietly, and looking at her; &quot;of what nature?&quot;</span>
<a name="l14964"><span class="ln">14964 </span></a>
<a name="l14965"><span class="ln">14965 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14966"><span class="ln">14966 </span></a>
<a name="l14967"><span class="ln">14967 </span></a><span class="s0">After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,</span>
<a name="l14968"><span class="ln">14968 </span></a><span class="s0">he replied,</span>
<a name="l14969"><span class="ln">14969 </span></a>
<a name="l14970"><span class="ln">14970 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard</span>
<a name="l14971"><span class="ln">14971 </span></a><span class="s0">that already.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14972"><span class="ln">14972 </span></a>
<a name="l14973"><span class="ln">14973 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How is it possible?&quot; cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks</span>
<a name="l14974"><span class="ln">14974 </span></a><span class="s0">towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he</span>
<a name="l14975"><span class="ln">14975 </span></a><span class="s0">might have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.</span>
<a name="l14976"><span class="ln">14976 </span></a>
<a name="l14977"><span class="ln">14977 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning,</span>
<a name="l14978"><span class="ln">14978 </span></a><span class="s0">and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14979"><span class="ln">14979 </span></a>
<a name="l14980"><span class="ln">14980 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little</span>
<a name="l14981"><span class="ln">14981 </span></a><span class="s0">more composure,</span>
<a name="l14982"><span class="ln">14982 </span></a>
<a name="l14983"><span class="ln">14983 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have</span>
<a name="l14984"><span class="ln">14984 </span></a><span class="s0">had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give</span>
<a name="l14985"><span class="ln">14985 </span></a><span class="s0">me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking</span>
<a name="l14986"><span class="ln">14986 </span></a><span class="s0">voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.&quot;</span>
<a name="l14987"><span class="ln">14987 </span></a>
<a name="l14988"><span class="ln">14988 </span></a><span class="s0">For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious</span>
<a name="l14989"><span class="ln">14989 </span></a><span class="s0">of having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm</span>
<a name="l14990"><span class="ln">14990 </span></a><span class="s0">drawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him</span>
<a name="l14991"><span class="ln">14991 </span></a><span class="s0">thus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,</span>
<a name="l14992"><span class="ln">14992 </span></a>
<a name="l14993"><span class="ln">14993 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own</span>
<a name="l14994"><span class="ln">14994 </span></a><span class="s0">excellent sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know</span>
<a name="l14995"><span class="ln">14995 </span></a><span class="s0">you will not allow yourself--.&quot;  Her arm was pressed again,</span>
<a name="l14996"><span class="ln">14996 </span></a><span class="s0">as he added, in a more broken and subdued accent, &quot;The feelings</span>
<a name="l14997"><span class="ln">14997 </span></a><span class="s0">of the warmest friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!&quot;--</span>
<a name="l14998"><span class="ln">14998 </span></a><span class="s0">And in a louder, steadier tone, he concluded with, &quot;He will soon</span>
<a name="l14999"><span class="ln">14999 </span></a><span class="s0">be gone.  They will soon be in Yorkshire.  I am sorry for _her_.</span>
<a name="l15000"><span class="ln">15000 </span></a><span class="s0">She deserves a better fate.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15001"><span class="ln">15001 </span></a>
<a name="l15002"><span class="ln">15002 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the</span>
<a name="l15003"><span class="ln">15003 </span></a><span class="s0">flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,</span>
<a name="l15004"><span class="ln">15004 </span></a>
<a name="l15005"><span class="ln">15005 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--</span>
<a name="l15006"><span class="ln">15006 </span></a><span class="s0">I am not in want of that sort of compassion.  My blindness to what</span>
<a name="l15007"><span class="ln">15007 </span></a><span class="s0">was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always</span>
<a name="l15008"><span class="ln">15008 </span></a><span class="s0">be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many</span>
<a name="l15009"><span class="ln">15009 </span></a><span class="s0">things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I</span>
<a name="l15010"><span class="ln">15010 </span></a><span class="s0">have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15011"><span class="ln">15011 </span></a>
<a name="l15012"><span class="ln">15012 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Emma!&quot; cried he, looking eagerly at her, &quot;are you, indeed?&quot;--</span>
<a name="l15013"><span class="ln">15013 </span></a><span class="s0">but checking himself--&quot;No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am</span>
<a name="l15014"><span class="ln">15014 </span></a><span class="s0">pleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret,</span>
<a name="l15015"><span class="ln">15015 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes</span>
<a name="l15016"><span class="ln">15016 </span></a><span class="s0">the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your</span>
<a name="l15017"><span class="ln">15017 </span></a><span class="s0">affections were not farther entangled!--I could never, I confess,</span>
<a name="l15018"><span class="ln">15018 </span></a><span class="s0">from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt--</span>
<a name="l15019"><span class="ln">15019 </span></a><span class="s0">I could only be certain that there was a preference--and a preference</span>
<a name="l15020"><span class="ln">15020 </span></a><span class="s0">which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name</span>
<a name="l15021"><span class="ln">15021 </span></a><span class="s0">of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?--</span>
<a name="l15022"><span class="ln">15022 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15023"><span class="ln">15023 </span></a>
<a name="l15024"><span class="ln">15024 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Mr. Knightley,&quot; said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--</span>
<a name="l15025"><span class="ln">15025 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am in a very extraordinary situation.  I cannot let you continue in</span>
<a name="l15026"><span class="ln">15026 </span></a><span class="s0">your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression,</span>
<a name="l15027"><span class="ln">15027 </span></a><span class="s0">I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have</span>
<a name="l15028"><span class="ln">15028 </span></a><span class="s0">been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might</span>
<a name="l15029"><span class="ln">15029 </span></a><span class="s0">be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--</span>
<a name="l15030"><span class="ln">15030 </span></a><span class="s0">But I never have.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15031"><span class="ln">15031 </span></a>
<a name="l15032"><span class="ln">15032 </span></a><span class="s0">He listened in perfect silence.  She wished him to speak, but he</span>
<a name="l15033"><span class="ln">15033 </span></a><span class="s0">would not.  She supposed she must say more before she were entitled</span>
<a name="l15034"><span class="ln">15034 </span></a><span class="s0">to his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower</span>
<a name="l15035"><span class="ln">15035 </span></a><span class="s0">herself in his opinion.  She went on, however.</span>

<a name="l15037"><span class="ln">15037 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted</span>
<a name="l15038"><span class="ln">15038 </span></a><span class="s0">by his attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--</span>
<a name="l15039"><span class="ln">15039 </span></a><span class="s0">An old story, probably--a common case--and no more than has happened</span>
<a name="l15040"><span class="ln">15040 </span></a><span class="s0">to hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable</span>
<a name="l15041"><span class="ln">15041 </span></a><span class="s0">in one who sets up as I do for Understanding.  Many circumstances</span>
<a name="l15042"><span class="ln">15042 </span></a><span class="s0">assisted the temptation.  He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was</span>
<a name="l15043"><span class="ln">15043 </span></a><span class="s0">continually here--I always found him very pleasant--and, in short,</span>
<a name="l15044"><span class="ln">15044 </span></a><span class="s0">for (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously,</span>
<a name="l15045"><span class="ln">15045 </span></a><span class="s0">they all centre in this at last--my vanity was flattered, and I</span>
<a name="l15046"><span class="ln">15046 </span></a><span class="s0">allowed his attentions.  Latterly, however--for some time, indeed--</span>
<a name="l15047"><span class="ln">15047 </span></a><span class="s0">I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them</span>
<a name="l15048"><span class="ln">15048 </span></a><span class="s0">a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.</span>
<a name="l15049"><span class="ln">15049 </span></a><span class="s0">He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me.  I have never been</span>
<a name="l15050"><span class="ln">15050 </span></a><span class="s0">attached to him.  And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour.</span>
<a name="l15051"><span class="ln">15051 </span></a><span class="s0">He never wished to attach me.  It was merely a blind to conceal</span>
<a name="l15052"><span class="ln">15052 </span></a><span class="s0">his real situation with another.--It was his object to blind</span>
<a name="l15053"><span class="ln">15053 </span></a><span class="s0">all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually</span>
<a name="l15054"><span class="ln">15054 </span></a><span class="s0">blinded than myself--except that I was _not_ blinded--that it was my</span>
<a name="l15055"><span class="ln">15055 </span></a><span class="s0">good fortune--that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15056"><span class="ln">15056 </span></a>
<a name="l15057"><span class="ln">15057 </span></a><span class="s0">She had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her</span>
<a name="l15058"><span class="ln">15058 </span></a><span class="s0">conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far</span>
<a name="l15059"><span class="ln">15059 </span></a><span class="s0">as she could judge, deep in thought.  At last, and tolerably</span>
<a name="l15060"><span class="ln">15060 </span></a><span class="s0">in his usual tone, he said,</span>
<a name="l15061"><span class="ln">15061 </span></a>
<a name="l15062"><span class="ln">15062 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,</span>
<a name="l15063"><span class="ln">15063 </span></a><span class="s0">however, that I may have underrated him.  My acquaintance with</span>
<a name="l15064"><span class="ln">15064 </span></a><span class="s0">him has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated</span>
<a name="l15065"><span class="ln">15065 </span></a><span class="s0">him hitherto, he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has</span>
<a name="l15066"><span class="ln">15066 </span></a><span class="s0">a chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill--and for her sake,</span>
<a name="l15067"><span class="ln">15067 </span></a><span class="s0">whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct,</span>
<a name="l15068"><span class="ln">15068 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall certainly wish him well.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15069"><span class="ln">15069 </span></a>
<a name="l15070"><span class="ln">15070 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have no doubt of their being happy together,&quot; said Emma;</span>
<a name="l15071"><span class="ln">15071 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15072"><span class="ln">15072 </span></a>
<a name="l15073"><span class="ln">15073 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He is a most fortunate man!&quot; returned Mr. Knightley, with energy.</span>
<a name="l15074"><span class="ln">15074 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;So early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man</span>
<a name="l15075"><span class="ln">15075 </span></a><span class="s0">chuses a wife, he generally chuses ill.  At three-and-twenty</span>
<a name="l15076"><span class="ln">15076 </span></a><span class="s0">to have drawn such a prize!  What years of felicity that man,</span>
<a name="l15077"><span class="ln">15077 </span></a><span class="s0">in all human calculation, has before him!--Assured of the love of</span>
<a name="l15078"><span class="ln">15078 </span></a><span class="s0">such a woman--the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character</span>
<a name="l15079"><span class="ln">15079 </span></a><span class="s0">vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,--</span>
<a name="l15080"><span class="ln">15080 </span></a><span class="s0">equality of situation--I mean, as far as regards society, and all the</span>
<a name="l15081"><span class="ln">15081 </span></a><span class="s0">habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one--</span>
<a name="l15082"><span class="ln">15082 </span></a><span class="s0">and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted,</span>
<a name="l15083"><span class="ln">15083 </span></a><span class="s0">such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the</span>
<a name="l15084"><span class="ln">15084 </span></a><span class="s0">only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman</span>
<a name="l15085"><span class="ln">15085 </span></a><span class="s0">a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it,</span>
<a name="l15086"><span class="ln">15086 </span></a><span class="s0">where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must, I think, be the happiest</span>
<a name="l15087"><span class="ln">15087 </span></a><span class="s0">of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune.</span>
<a name="l15088"><span class="ln">15088 </span></a><span class="s0">Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman</span>
<a name="l15089"><span class="ln">15089 </span></a><span class="s0">at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her</span>
<a name="l15090"><span class="ln">15090 </span></a><span class="s0">by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought round</span>
<a name="l15091"><span class="ln">15091 </span></a><span class="s0">the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found</span>
<a name="l15092"><span class="ln">15092 </span></a><span class="s0">her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has</span>
<a name="l15093"><span class="ln">15093 </span></a><span class="s0">only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--</span>
<a name="l15094"><span class="ln">15094 </span></a><span class="s0">He had used every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--</span>
<a name="l15095"><span class="ln">15095 </span></a><span class="s0">He is a fortunate man indeed!&quot;</span>
<a name="l15096"><span class="ln">15096 </span></a>
<a name="l15097"><span class="ln">15097 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You speak as if you envied him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15098"><span class="ln">15098 </span></a>
<a name="l15099"><span class="ln">15099 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And I do envy him, Emma.  In one respect he is the object of my envy.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15100"><span class="ln">15100 </span></a>
<a name="l15101"><span class="ln">15101 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could say no more.  They seemed to be within half a sentence</span>
<a name="l15102"><span class="ln">15102 </span></a><span class="s0">of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject,</span>
<a name="l15103"><span class="ln">15103 </span></a><span class="s0">if possible.  She made her plan; she would speak of something</span>
<a name="l15104"><span class="ln">15104 </span></a><span class="s0">totally different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she</span>
<a name="l15105"><span class="ln">15105 </span></a><span class="s0">only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her,</span>
<a name="l15106"><span class="ln">15106 </span></a><span class="s0">by saying,</span>
<a name="l15107"><span class="ln">15107 </span></a>
<a name="l15108"><span class="ln">15108 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined,</span>
<a name="l15109"><span class="ln">15109 </span></a><span class="s0">I see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise.</span>
<a name="l15110"><span class="ln">15110 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it</span>
<a name="l15111"><span class="ln">15111 </span></a><span class="s0">unsaid the next moment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15112"><span class="ln">15112 </span></a>
<a name="l15113"><span class="ln">15113 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,&quot; she eagerly cried.</span>
<a name="l15114"><span class="ln">15114 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15115"><span class="ln">15115 </span></a>
<a name="l15116"><span class="ln">15116 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not</span>
<a name="l15117"><span class="ln">15117 </span></a><span class="s0">another syllable followed.</span>
<a name="l15118"><span class="ln">15118 </span></a>
<a name="l15119"><span class="ln">15119 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not bear to give him pain.  He was wishing to confide in her--</span>
<a name="l15120"><span class="ln">15120 </span></a><span class="s0">perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.</span>
<a name="l15121"><span class="ln">15121 </span></a><span class="s0">She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it;</span>
<a name="l15122"><span class="ln">15122 </span></a><span class="s0">she might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him</span>
<a name="l15123"><span class="ln">15123 </span></a><span class="s0">his own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision,</span>
<a name="l15124"><span class="ln">15124 </span></a><span class="s0">which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind</span>
<a name="l15125"><span class="ln">15125 </span></a><span class="s0">as his.--They had reached the house.</span>
<a name="l15126"><span class="ln">15126 </span></a>
<a name="l15127"><span class="ln">15127 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are going in, I suppose?&quot; said he.</span>
<a name="l15128"><span class="ln">15128 </span></a>
<a name="l15129"><span class="ln">15129 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No,&quot;--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner</span>
<a name="l15130"><span class="ln">15130 </span></a><span class="s0">in which he still spoke--&quot;I should like to take another turn.</span>
<a name="l15131"><span class="ln">15131 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Perry is not gone.&quot;  And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--</span>
<a name="l15132"><span class="ln">15132 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid,</span>
<a name="l15133"><span class="ln">15133 </span></a><span class="s0">gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me</span>
<a name="l15134"><span class="ln">15134 </span></a><span class="s0">as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have</span>
<a name="l15135"><span class="ln">15135 </span></a><span class="s0">in contemplation--as a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will</span>
<a name="l15136"><span class="ln">15136 </span></a><span class="s0">hear whatever you like.  I will tell you exactly what I think.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15137"><span class="ln">15137 </span></a>
<a name="l15138"><span class="ln">15138 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;As a friend!&quot;--repeated Mr. Knightley.--&quot;Emma, that I fear is</span>
<a name="l15139"><span class="ln">15139 </span></a><span class="s0">a word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--</span>
<a name="l15140"><span class="ln">15140 </span></a><span class="s0">I have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your offer--</span>
<a name="l15141"><span class="ln">15141 </span></a><span class="s0">Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you</span>
<a name="l15142"><span class="ln">15142 </span></a><span class="s0">as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?&quot;</span>
<a name="l15143"><span class="ln">15143 </span></a>
<a name="l15144"><span class="ln">15144 </span></a><span class="s0">He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression</span>
<a name="l15145"><span class="ln">15145 </span></a><span class="s0">of his eyes overpowered her.</span>
<a name="l15146"><span class="ln">15146 </span></a>
<a name="l15147"><span class="ln">15147 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My dearest Emma,&quot; said he, &quot;for dearest you will always be,</span>
<a name="l15148"><span class="ln">15148 </span></a><span class="s0">whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest,</span>
<a name="l15149"><span class="ln">15149 </span></a><span class="s0">most beloved Emma--tell me at once.  Say `No,' if it is to be said.&quot;--</span>
<a name="l15150"><span class="ln">15150 </span></a><span class="s0">She could really say nothing.--&quot;You are silent,&quot; he cried,</span>
<a name="l15151"><span class="ln">15151 </span></a><span class="s0">with great animation; &quot;absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15152"><span class="ln">15152 </span></a>
<a name="l15153"><span class="ln">15153 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.</span>
<a name="l15154"><span class="ln">15154 </span></a><span class="s0">The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps</span>
<a name="l15155"><span class="ln">15155 </span></a><span class="s0">the most prominent feeling.</span>
<a name="l15156"><span class="ln">15156 </span></a>
<a name="l15157"><span class="ln">15157 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I cannot make speeches, Emma:&quot;  he soon resumed; and in a tone</span>
<a name="l15158"><span class="ln">15158 </span></a><span class="s0">of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was</span>
<a name="l15159"><span class="ln">15159 </span></a><span class="s0">tolerably convincing.--&quot;If I loved you less, I might be able</span>
<a name="l15160"><span class="ln">15160 </span></a><span class="s0">to talk about it more.  But you know what I am.--You hear nothing</span>
<a name="l15161"><span class="ln">15161 </span></a><span class="s0">but truth from me.--I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you</span>
<a name="l15162"><span class="ln">15162 </span></a><span class="s0">have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.--</span>
<a name="l15163"><span class="ln">15163 </span></a><span class="s0">Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as</span>
<a name="l15164"><span class="ln">15164 </span></a><span class="s0">you have borne with them.  The manner, perhaps, may have as little</span>
<a name="l15165"><span class="ln">15165 </span></a><span class="s0">to recommend them.  God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.--</span>
<a name="l15166"><span class="ln">15166 </span></a><span class="s0">But you understand me.--Yes, you see, you understand my feelings--</span>
<a name="l15167"><span class="ln">15167 </span></a><span class="s0">and will return them if you can.  At present, I ask only to hear,</span>
<a name="l15168"><span class="ln">15168 </span></a><span class="s0">once to hear your voice.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15169"><span class="ln">15169 </span></a>
<a name="l15170"><span class="ln">15170 </span></a><span class="s0">While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful</span>
<a name="l15171"><span class="ln">15171 </span></a><span class="s0">velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--</span>
<a name="l15172"><span class="ln">15172 </span></a><span class="s0">to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that</span>
<a name="l15173"><span class="ln">15173 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion,</span>
<a name="l15174"><span class="ln">15174 </span></a><span class="s0">as complete a delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing;</span>
<a name="l15175"><span class="ln">15175 </span></a><span class="s0">that she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying</span>
<a name="l15176"><span class="ln">15176 </span></a><span class="s0">relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her</span>
<a name="l15177"><span class="ln">15177 </span></a><span class="s0">own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance,</span>
<a name="l15178"><span class="ln">15178 </span></a><span class="s0">her discouragement, had been all received as discouragement</span>
<a name="l15179"><span class="ln">15179 </span></a><span class="s0">from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions,</span>
<a name="l15180"><span class="ln">15180 </span></a><span class="s0">with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to</span>
<a name="l15181"><span class="ln">15181 </span></a><span class="s0">rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and to resolve</span>
<a name="l15182"><span class="ln">15182 </span></a><span class="s0">that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service she could</span>
<a name="l15183"><span class="ln">15183 </span></a><span class="s0">now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment</span>
<a name="l15184"><span class="ln">15184 </span></a><span class="s0">which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection</span>
<a name="l15185"><span class="ln">15185 </span></a><span class="s0">from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two--</span>
<a name="l15186"><span class="ln">15186 </span></a><span class="s0">or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him</span>
<a name="l15187"><span class="ln">15187 </span></a><span class="s0">at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he</span>
<a name="l15188"><span class="ln">15188 </span></a><span class="s0">could not marry them both, Emma had it not.  She felt for Harriet,</span>
<a name="l15189"><span class="ln">15189 </span></a><span class="s0">with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad,</span>
<a name="l15190"><span class="ln">15190 </span></a><span class="s0">opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain.</span>
<a name="l15191"><span class="ln">15191 </span></a><span class="s0">She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to</span>
<a name="l15192"><span class="ln">15192 </span></a><span class="s0">her for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings,</span>
<a name="l15193"><span class="ln">15193 </span></a><span class="s0">and as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such</span>
<a name="l15194"><span class="ln">15194 </span></a><span class="s0">alliance for him, as most unequal and degrading.  Her way was clear,</span>
<a name="l15195"><span class="ln">15195 </span></a><span class="s0">though not quite smooth.--She spoke then, on being so entreated.--</span>
<a name="l15196"><span class="ln">15196 </span></a><span class="s0">What did she say?--Just what she ought, of course.  A lady always does.--</span>
<a name="l15197"><span class="ln">15197 </span></a><span class="s0">She said enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invite him</span>
<a name="l15198"><span class="ln">15198 </span></a><span class="s0">to say more himself.  He _had_ despaired at one period; he had received</span>
<a name="l15199"><span class="ln">15199 </span></a><span class="s0">such an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed</span>
<a name="l15200"><span class="ln">15200 </span></a><span class="s0">every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had</span>
<a name="l15201"><span class="ln">15201 </span></a><span class="s0">perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn,</span>
<a name="l15202"><span class="ln">15202 </span></a><span class="s0">her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to,</span>
<a name="l15203"><span class="ln">15203 </span></a><span class="s0">might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency;</span>
<a name="l15204"><span class="ln">15204 </span></a><span class="s0">but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no</span>
<a name="l15205"><span class="ln">15205 </span></a><span class="s0">farther explanation.</span>
<a name="l15206"><span class="ln">15206 </span></a>
<a name="l15207"><span class="ln">15207 </span></a><span class="s0">Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;</span>
<a name="l15208"><span class="ln">15208 </span></a><span class="s0">seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised,</span>
<a name="l15209"><span class="ln">15209 </span></a><span class="s0">or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct</span>
<a name="l15210"><span class="ln">15210 </span></a><span class="s0">is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--</span>
<a name="l15211"><span class="ln">15211 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than</span>
<a name="l15212"><span class="ln">15212 </span></a><span class="s0">she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.</span>
<a name="l15213"><span class="ln">15213 </span></a>
<a name="l15214"><span class="ln">15214 </span></a><span class="s0">He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence.</span>
<a name="l15215"><span class="ln">15215 </span></a><span class="s0">He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it.</span>
<a name="l15216"><span class="ln">15216 </span></a><span class="s0">He had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's</span>
<a name="l15217"><span class="ln">15217 </span></a><span class="s0">engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring,</span>
<a name="l15218"><span class="ln">15218 </span></a><span class="s0">if she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest</span>
<a name="l15219"><span class="ln">15219 </span></a><span class="s0">had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard,</span>
<a name="l15220"><span class="ln">15220 </span></a><span class="s0">on his feelings.  The delightful assurance of her total indifference</span>
<a name="l15221"><span class="ln">15221 </span></a><span class="s0">towards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged</span>
<a name="l15222"><span class="ln">15222 </span></a><span class="s0">from him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain</span>
<a name="l15223"><span class="ln">15223 </span></a><span class="s0">her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope--he had only,</span>
<a name="l15224"><span class="ln">15224 </span></a><span class="s0">in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be</span>
<a name="l15225"><span class="ln">15225 </span></a><span class="s0">told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior</span>
<a name="l15226"><span class="ln">15226 </span></a><span class="s0">hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.--</span>
<a name="l15227"><span class="ln">15227 </span></a><span class="s0">The affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create,</span>
<a name="l15228"><span class="ln">15228 </span></a><span class="s0">if he could, was already his!--Within half an hour, he had passed</span>
<a name="l15229"><span class="ln">15229 </span></a><span class="s0">from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like</span>
<a name="l15230"><span class="ln">15230 </span></a><span class="s0">perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.</span>
<a name="l15231"><span class="ln">15231 </span></a>
<a name="l15232"><span class="ln">15232 </span></a><span class="s0">_Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the</span>
<a name="l15233"><span class="ln">15233 </span></a><span class="s0">same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each</span>
<a name="l15234"><span class="ln">15234 </span></a><span class="s0">the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side,</span>
<a name="l15235"><span class="ln">15235 </span></a><span class="s0">there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival,</span>
<a name="l15236"><span class="ln">15236 </span></a><span class="s0">or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love</span>
<a name="l15237"><span class="ln">15237 </span></a><span class="s0">with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period,</span>
<a name="l15238"><span class="ln">15238 </span></a><span class="s0">one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other.</span>
<a name="l15239"><span class="ln">15239 </span></a><span class="s0">It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from</span>
<a name="l15240"><span class="ln">15240 </span></a><span class="s0">the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away.</span>
<a name="l15241"><span class="ln">15241 </span></a><span class="s0">He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted,</span>
<a name="l15242"><span class="ln">15242 </span></a><span class="s0">encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.--</span>
<a name="l15243"><span class="ln">15243 </span></a><span class="s0">But he had gone to a wrong place.  There was too much domestic</span>
<a name="l15244"><span class="ln">15244 </span></a><span class="s0">happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it;</span>
<a name="l15245"><span class="ln">15245 </span></a><span class="s0">Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking</span>
<a name="l15246"><span class="ln">15246 </span></a><span class="s0">inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him,</span>
<a name="l15247"><span class="ln">15247 </span></a><span class="s0">for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had</span>
<a name="l15248"><span class="ln">15248 </span></a><span class="s0">stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's</span>
<a name="l15249"><span class="ln">15249 </span></a><span class="s0">post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the</span>
<a name="l15250"><span class="ln">15250 </span></a><span class="s0">gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel,</span>
<a name="l15251"><span class="ln">15251 </span></a><span class="s0">having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma,</span>
<a name="l15252"><span class="ln">15252 </span></a><span class="s0">was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,</span>
<a name="l15253"><span class="ln">15253 </span></a><span class="s0">that he could stay no longer.  He had ridden home through the rain;</span>
<a name="l15254"><span class="ln">15254 </span></a><span class="s0">and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest</span>
<a name="l15255"><span class="ln">15255 </span></a><span class="s0">and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults,</span>
<a name="l15256"><span class="ln">15256 </span></a><span class="s0">bore the discovery.</span>
<a name="l15257"><span class="ln">15257 </span></a>
<a name="l15258"><span class="ln">15258 </span></a><span class="s0">He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--</span>
<a name="l15259"><span class="ln">15259 </span></a><span class="s0">He heard her declare that she had never loved him.  Frank Churchill's</span>
<a name="l15260"><span class="ln">15260 </span></a><span class="s0">character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,</span>
<a name="l15261"><span class="ln">15261 </span></a><span class="s0">when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought</span>
<a name="l15262"><span class="ln">15262 </span></a><span class="s0">of Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort</span>
<a name="l15263"><span class="ln">15263 </span></a><span class="s0">of fellow.</span>
<a name="l15264"><span class="ln">15264 </span></a>

<a name="l15268"><span class="ln">15268 </span></a>
<a name="l15269"><span class="ln">15269 </span></a>
<a name="l15270"><span class="ln">15270 </span></a><span class="s0">What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house</span>
<a name="l15271"><span class="ln">15271 </span></a><span class="s0">from what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope</span>
<a name="l15272"><span class="ln">15272 </span></a><span class="s0">for a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite</span>
<a name="l15273"><span class="ln">15273 </span></a><span class="s0">flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed</span>
<a name="l15274"><span class="ln">15274 </span></a><span class="s0">must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.</span>
<a name="l15275"><span class="ln">15275 </span></a>
<a name="l15276"><span class="ln">15276 </span></a><span class="s0">They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--</span>
<a name="l15277"><span class="ln">15277 </span></a><span class="s0">how often it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen</span>
<a name="l15278"><span class="ln">15278 </span></a><span class="s0">on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful</span>
<a name="l15279"><span class="ln">15279 </span></a><span class="s0">effect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits,</span>
<a name="l15280"><span class="ln">15280 </span></a><span class="s0">never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could</span>
<a name="l15281"><span class="ln">15281 </span></a><span class="s0">summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house,</span>
<a name="l15282"><span class="ln">15282 </span></a><span class="s0">or even the attentive daughter.</span>
<a name="l15283"><span class="ln">15283 </span></a>
<a name="l15284"><span class="ln">15284 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him</span>
<a name="l15285"><span class="ln">15285 </span></a><span class="s0">in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so</span>
<a name="l15286"><span class="ln">15286 </span></a><span class="s0">anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he</span>
<a name="l15287"><span class="ln">15287 </span></a><span class="s0">have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs;</span>
<a name="l15288"><span class="ln">15288 </span></a><span class="s0">but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil,</span>
<a name="l15289"><span class="ln">15289 </span></a><span class="s0">without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in</span>
<a name="l15290"><span class="ln">15290 </span></a><span class="s0">the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably</span>
<a name="l15291"><span class="ln">15291 </span></a><span class="s0">all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked</span>
<a name="l15292"><span class="ln">15292 </span></a><span class="s0">on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they</span>
<a name="l15293"><span class="ln">15293 </span></a><span class="s0">could have told him in return.</span>
<a name="l15294"><span class="ln">15294 </span></a>
<a name="l15295"><span class="ln">15295 </span></a><span class="s0">As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;</span>
<a name="l15296"><span class="ln">15296 </span></a><span class="s0">but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised</span>
<a name="l15297"><span class="ln">15297 </span></a><span class="s0">and subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was</span>
<a name="l15298"><span class="ln">15298 </span></a><span class="s0">the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious</span>
<a name="l15299"><span class="ln">15299 </span></a><span class="s0">points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness</span>
<a name="l15300"><span class="ln">15300 </span></a><span class="s0">must have some alloy.  Her father--and Harriet.  She could not be</span>
<a name="l15301"><span class="ln">15301 </span></a><span class="s0">alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims;</span>
<a name="l15302"><span class="ln">15302 </span></a><span class="s0">and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question.</span>
<a name="l15303"><span class="ln">15303 </span></a><span class="s0">With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.</span>
<a name="l15304"><span class="ln">15304 </span></a><span class="s0">She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short</span>
<a name="l15305"><span class="ln">15305 </span></a><span class="s0">parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution</span>
<a name="l15306"><span class="ln">15306 </span></a><span class="s0">of never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it,</span>
<a name="l15307"><span class="ln">15307 </span></a><span class="s0">as a sin of thought.  While he lived, it must be only an engagement;</span>
<a name="l15308"><span class="ln">15308 </span></a><span class="s0">but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of</span>
<a name="l15309"><span class="ln">15309 </span></a><span class="s0">drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--</span>
<a name="l15310"><span class="ln">15310 </span></a><span class="s0">How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--</span>
<a name="l15311"><span class="ln">15311 </span></a><span class="s0">how to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make</span>
<a name="l15312"><span class="ln">15312 </span></a><span class="s0">her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?--</span>
<a name="l15313"><span class="ln">15313 </span></a><span class="s0">On these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great--</span>
<a name="l15314"><span class="ln">15314 </span></a><span class="s0">and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter</span>
<a name="l15315"><span class="ln">15315 </span></a><span class="s0">reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.--</span>
<a name="l15316"><span class="ln">15316 </span></a><span class="s0">She could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a</span>
<a name="l15317"><span class="ln">15317 </span></a><span class="s0">meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter;</span>
<a name="l15318"><span class="ln">15318 </span></a><span class="s0">that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just</span>
<a name="l15319"><span class="ln">15319 </span></a><span class="s0">now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more--</span>
<a name="l15320"><span class="ln">15320 </span></a><span class="s0">nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation</span>
<a name="l15321"><span class="ln">15321 </span></a><span class="s0">for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;</span>
<a name="l15322"><span class="ln">15322 </span></a><span class="s0">and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--</span>
<a name="l15323"><span class="ln">15323 </span></a><span class="s0">She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited</span>
<a name="l15324"><span class="ln">15324 </span></a><span class="s0">by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--</span>
<a name="l15325"><span class="ln">15325 </span></a><span class="s0">At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself,</span>
<a name="l15326"><span class="ln">15326 </span></a><span class="s0">from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting</span>
<a name="l15327"><span class="ln">15327 </span></a><span class="s0">of the evil day, when they must all be together again.</span>
<a name="l15328"><span class="ln">15328 </span></a>
<a name="l15329"><span class="ln">15329 </span></a><span class="s0">She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment</span>
<a name="l15330"><span class="ln">15330 </span></a><span class="s0">which left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l15331"><span class="ln">15331 </span></a><span class="s0">in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon;</span>
<a name="l15332"><span class="ln">15332 </span></a><span class="s0">and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again</span>
<a name="l15333"><span class="ln">15333 </span></a><span class="s0">with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate</span>
<a name="l15334"><span class="ln">15334 </span></a><span class="s0">her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.</span>
<a name="l15335"><span class="ln">15335 </span></a>
<a name="l15336"><span class="ln">15336 </span></a><span class="s0">He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have</span>
<a name="l15337"><span class="ln">15337 </span></a><span class="s0">the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter</span>
<a name="l15338"><span class="ln">15338 </span></a><span class="s0">was brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed</span>
<a name="l15339"><span class="ln">15339 </span></a><span class="s0">what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--</span>
<a name="l15340"><span class="ln">15340 </span></a><span class="s0">She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted</span>
<a name="l15341"><span class="ln">15341 </span></a><span class="s0">no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself--</span>
<a name="l15342"><span class="ln">15342 </span></a><span class="s0">and as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was</span>
<a name="l15343"><span class="ln">15343 </span></a><span class="s0">incapable of it.--It must be waded through, however.  She opened</span>
<a name="l15344"><span class="ln">15344 </span></a><span class="s0">the packet; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself,</span>
<a name="l15345"><span class="ln">15345 </span></a><span class="s0">ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.</span>
<a name="l15346"><span class="ln">15346 </span></a>

<a name="l15368"><span class="ln">15368 </span></a><span class="s0">You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of even</span>
<a name="l15369"><span class="ln">15369 </span></a><span class="s0">all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.--</span>
<a name="l15370"><span class="ln">15370 </span></a><span class="s0">But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent.</span>
<a name="l15371"><span class="ln">15371 </span></a><span class="s0">My courage rises while I write.  It is very difficult for the</span>
<a name="l15372"><span class="ln">15372 </span></a><span class="s0">prosperous to be humble.  I have already met with such success</span>
<a name="l15373"><span class="ln">15373 </span></a><span class="s0">in two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking</span>
<a name="l15374"><span class="ln">15374 </span></a><span class="s0">myself too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have</span>
<a name="l15375"><span class="ln">15375 </span></a><span class="s0">had any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend</span>
<a name="l15376"><span class="ln">15376 </span></a><span class="s0">the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls;</span>
<a name="l15377"><span class="ln">15377 </span></a><span class="s0">you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept</span>
<a name="l15378"><span class="ln">15378 </span></a><span class="s0">at all hazards.  This was the fact.  My right to place myself</span>
<a name="l15379"><span class="ln">15379 </span></a><span class="s0">in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.</span>
<a name="l15380"><span class="ln">15380 </span></a><span class="s0">I shall not discuss it here.  For my temptation to _think_ it a right,</span>
<a name="l15381"><span class="ln">15381 </span></a><span class="s0">I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,</span>
<a name="l15382"><span class="ln">15382 </span></a><span class="s0">and casements above, in Highbury.  I dared not address her openly;</span>
<a name="l15383"><span class="ln">15383 </span></a><span class="s0">my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well</span>
<a name="l15384"><span class="ln">15384 </span></a><span class="s0">known to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail,</span>
<a name="l15385"><span class="ln">15385 </span></a><span class="s0">before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female</span>
<a name="l15386"><span class="ln">15386 </span></a><span class="s0">mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--</span>
<a name="l15387"><span class="ln">15387 </span></a><span class="s0">Had she refused, I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say,</span>
<a name="l15388"><span class="ln">15388 </span></a><span class="s0">what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--</span>
<a name="l15389"><span class="ln">15389 </span></a><span class="s0">To any thing, every thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects,</span>
<a name="l15390"><span class="ln">15390 </span></a><span class="s0">sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness.</span>
<a name="l15391"><span class="ln">15391 </span></a><span class="s0">Every possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings</span>
<a name="l15392"><span class="ln">15392 </span></a><span class="s0">secured, in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence.</span>
<a name="l15393"><span class="ln">15393 </span></a><span class="s0">If you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam,</span>
<a name="l15394"><span class="ln">15394 </span></a><span class="s0">of being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting</span>
<a name="l15395"><span class="ln">15395 </span></a><span class="s0">a disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses</span>
<a name="l15396"><span class="ln">15396 </span></a><span class="s0">or lands can ever equal the value of.--See me, then, under these</span>
<a name="l15397"><span class="ln">15397 </span></a><span class="s0">circumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I</span>
<a name="l15398"><span class="ln">15398 </span></a><span class="s0">am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner paid.</span>
<a name="l15399"><span class="ln">15399 </span></a><span class="s0">You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax</span>
<a name="l15400"><span class="ln">15400 </span></a><span class="s0">was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person slighted, you will</span>
<a name="l15401"><span class="ln">15401 </span></a><span class="s0">forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion,</span>
<a name="l15402"><span class="ln">15402 </span></a><span class="s0">by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house,</span>
<a name="l15403"><span class="ln">15403 </span></a><span class="s0">so long I lost the blessing of knowing you.  My behaviour,</span>
<a name="l15404"><span class="ln">15404 </span></a><span class="s0">during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not,</span>
<a name="l15405"><span class="ln">15405 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point.</span>
<a name="l15406"><span class="ln">15406 </span></a><span class="s0">And now I come to the principal, the only important part of my</span>
<a name="l15407"><span class="ln">15407 </span></a><span class="s0">conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety,</span>
<a name="l15408"><span class="ln">15408 </span></a><span class="s0">or requires very solicitous explanation.  With the greatest respect,</span>
<a name="l15409"><span class="ln">15409 </span></a><span class="s0">and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father</span>
<a name="l15410"><span class="ln">15410 </span></a><span class="s0">perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.--</span>
<a name="l15411"><span class="ln">15411 </span></a><span class="s0">A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion,</span>
<a name="l15412"><span class="ln">15412 </span></a><span class="s0">and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour</span>
<a name="l15413"><span class="ln">15413 </span></a><span class="s0">to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--</span>
<a name="l15414"><span class="ln">15414 </span></a><span class="s0">In order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led</span>
<a name="l15415"><span class="ln">15415 </span></a><span class="s0">on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy</span>
<a name="l15416"><span class="ln">15416 </span></a><span class="s0">into which we were immediately thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss</span>
<a name="l15417"><span class="ln">15417 </span></a><span class="s0">Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but I am sure you will believe</span>
<a name="l15418"><span class="ln">15418 </span></a><span class="s0">the declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference,</span>
<a name="l15419"><span class="ln">15419 </span></a><span class="s0">I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.--</span>
<a name="l15420"><span class="ln">15420 </span></a><span class="s0">Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me</span>
<a name="l15421"><span class="ln">15421 </span></a><span class="s0">the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was</span>
<a name="l15422"><span class="ln">15422 </span></a><span class="s0">perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much</span>
<a name="l15423"><span class="ln">15423 </span></a><span class="s0">my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy,</span>
<a name="l15424"><span class="ln">15424 </span></a><span class="s0">friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.</span>
<a name="l15425"><span class="ln">15425 </span></a><span class="s0">We seemed to understand each other.  From our relative situation,</span>
<a name="l15426"><span class="ln">15426 </span></a><span class="s0">those attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss</span>
<a name="l15427"><span class="ln">15427 </span></a><span class="s0">Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of</span>
<a name="l15428"><span class="ln">15428 </span></a><span class="s0">that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her,</span>
<a name="l15429"><span class="ln">15429 </span></a><span class="s0">I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth,</span>
<a name="l15430"><span class="ln">15430 </span></a><span class="s0">and I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no</span>
<a name="l15431"><span class="ln">15431 </span></a><span class="s0">doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some degree.--</span>
<a name="l15432"><span class="ln">15432 </span></a><span class="s0">She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must</span>
<a name="l15433"><span class="ln">15433 </span></a><span class="s0">have penetrated a part.  I cannot doubt it.  You will find,</span>
<a name="l15434"><span class="ln">15434 </span></a><span class="s0">whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints,</span>
<a name="l15435"><span class="ln">15435 </span></a><span class="s0">that it did not take her wholly by surprize.  She frequently gave</span>
<a name="l15436"><span class="ln">15436 </span></a><span class="s0">me hints of it.  I remember her telling me at the ball, that I</span>
<a name="l15437"><span class="ln">15437 </span></a><span class="s0">owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--</span>
<a name="l15438"><span class="ln">15438 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted</span>
<a name="l15439"><span class="ln">15439 </span></a><span class="s0">by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss.</span>
<a name="l15440"><span class="ln">15440 </span></a><span class="s0">While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l15441"><span class="ln">15441 </span></a><span class="s0">I could deserve nothing from either.  Acquit me here, and procure</span>
<a name="l15442"><span class="ln">15442 </span></a><span class="s0">for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that</span>
<a name="l15443"><span class="ln">15443 </span></a><span class="s0">said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection,</span>
<a name="l15444"><span class="ln">15444 </span></a><span class="s0">as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.--</span>
<a name="l15445"><span class="ln">15445 </span></a><span class="s0">Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have</span>
<a name="l15446"><span class="ln">15446 </span></a><span class="s0">now a key to.  My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get</span>
<a name="l15447"><span class="ln">15447 </span></a><span class="s0">my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.</span>
<a name="l15448"><span class="ln">15448 </span></a><span class="s0">If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--</span>
<a name="l15449"><span class="ln">15449 </span></a><span class="s0">Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say,</span>
<a name="l15450"><span class="ln">15450 </span></a><span class="s0">that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would</span>
<a name="l15451"><span class="ln">15451 </span></a><span class="s0">never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--</span>
<a name="l15452"><span class="ln">15452 </span></a><span class="s0">The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,</span>
<a name="l15453"><span class="ln">15453 </span></a><span class="s0">my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to.</span>
<a name="l15454"><span class="ln">15454 </span></a><span class="s0">You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.--</span>
<a name="l15455"><span class="ln">15455 </span></a><span class="s0">No description can describe her.  She must tell you herself what she is--</span>
<a name="l15456"><span class="ln">15456 </span></a><span class="s0">yet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would</span>
<a name="l15457"><span class="ln">15457 </span></a><span class="s0">so designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter,</span>
<a name="l15458"><span class="ln">15458 </span></a><span class="s0">which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.--</span>
<a name="l15459"><span class="ln">15459 </span></a><span class="s0">She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains,</span>
<a name="l15460"><span class="ln">15460 </span></a><span class="s0">I dare not depend.  I want to have your opinion of her looks.</span>
<a name="l15461"><span class="ln">15461 </span></a><span class="s0">I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.</span>
<a name="l15462"><span class="ln">15462 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps it is paid already.  Let me hear from you without delay;</span>
<a name="l15463"><span class="ln">15463 </span></a><span class="s0">I am impatient for a thousand particulars.  Remember how few</span>
<a name="l15464"><span class="ln">15464 </span></a><span class="s0">minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state:</span>
<a name="l15465"><span class="ln">15465 </span></a><span class="s0">and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness</span>
<a name="l15466"><span class="ln">15466 </span></a><span class="s0">or misery.  When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with,</span>
<a name="l15467"><span class="ln">15467 </span></a><span class="s0">of her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad</span>
<a name="l15468"><span class="ln">15468 </span></a><span class="s0">with joy:  but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her,</span>
<a name="l15469"><span class="ln">15469 </span></a><span class="s0">and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger.</span>
<a name="l15470"><span class="ln">15470 </span></a><span class="s0">If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet.</span>
<a name="l15471"><span class="ln">15471 </span></a><span class="s0">My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add</span>
<a name="l15472"><span class="ln">15472 </span></a><span class="s0">to this long letter.  You have not heard all that you ought to hear.</span>
<a name="l15473"><span class="ln">15473 </span></a><span class="s0">I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness,</span>
<a name="l15474"><span class="ln">15474 </span></a><span class="s0">and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out,</span>
<a name="l15475"><span class="ln">15475 </span></a><span class="s0">needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you</span>
<a name="l15476"><span class="ln">15476 </span></a><span class="s0">will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects,</span>
<a name="l15477"><span class="ln">15477 </span></a><span class="s0">I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the</span>
<a name="l15478"><span class="ln">15478 </span></a><span class="s0">very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.</span>
<a name="l15479"><span class="ln">15479 </span></a><span class="s0">I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have</span>
<a name="l15480"><span class="ln">15480 </span></a><span class="s0">felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.--</span>
<a name="l15481"><span class="ln">15481 </span></a><span class="s0">But I had no choice.  The hasty engagement she had entered into with</span>
<a name="l15482"><span class="ln">15482 </span></a><span class="s0">that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly,</span>
<a name="l15483"><span class="ln">15483 </span></a><span class="s0">to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country,</span>
<a name="l15484"><span class="ln">15484 </span></a><span class="s0">and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter</span>
<a name="l15485"><span class="ln">15485 </span></a><span class="s0">what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect</span>
<a name="l15486"><span class="ln">15486 </span></a><span class="s0">for me.  I behaved shamefully.  And here I can admit, that my manners</span>
<a name="l15487"><span class="ln">15487 </span></a><span class="s0">to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable.</span>
<a name="l15488"><span class="ln">15488 </span></a><span class="s0">_She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of</span>
<a name="l15489"><span class="ln">15489 </span></a><span class="s0">concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased;</span>
<a name="l15490"><span class="ln">15490 </span></a><span class="s0">I thought unreasonably so:  I thought her, on a thousand occasions,</span>
<a name="l15491"><span class="ln">15491 </span></a><span class="s0">unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious:  I thought her even cold.</span>
<a name="l15492"><span class="ln">15492 </span></a><span class="s0">But she was always right.  If I had followed her judgment, and subdued</span>
<a name="l15493"><span class="ln">15493 </span></a><span class="s0">my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have</span>
<a name="l15494"><span class="ln">15494 </span></a><span class="s0">escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--</span>
<a name="l15495"><span class="ln">15495 </span></a><span class="s0">Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little</span>
<a name="l15496"><span class="ln">15496 </span></a><span class="s0">dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis.  I was late;</span>
<a name="l15497"><span class="ln">15497 </span></a><span class="s0">I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her,</span>
<a name="l15498"><span class="ln">15498 </span></a><span class="s0">but she would not suffer it.  She absolutely refused to allow me,</span>
<a name="l15499"><span class="ln">15499 </span></a><span class="s0">which I then thought most unreasonable.  Now, however, I see nothing</span>
<a name="l15500"><span class="ln">15500 </span></a><span class="s0">in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion.</span>
<a name="l15501"><span class="ln">15501 </span></a><span class="s0">While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one</span>
<a name="l15502"><span class="ln">15502 </span></a><span class="s0">hour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she</span>
<a name="l15503"><span class="ln">15503 </span></a><span class="s0">to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made</span>
<a name="l15504"><span class="ln">15504 </span></a><span class="s0">every previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together</span>
<a name="l15505"><span class="ln">15505 </span></a><span class="s0">between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.--</span>
<a name="l15506"><span class="ln">15506 </span></a><span class="s0">I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her affection.</span>
<a name="l15507"><span class="ln">15507 </span></a><span class="s0">I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by</span>
<a name="l15508"><span class="ln">15508 </span></a><span class="s0">such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her,</span>
<a name="l15509"><span class="ln">15509 </span></a><span class="s0">and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been</span>
<a name="l15510"><span class="ln">15510 </span></a><span class="s0">impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her</span>
<a name="l15511"><span class="ln">15511 </span></a><span class="s0">resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--</span>
<a name="l15512"><span class="ln">15512 </span></a><span class="s0">In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side,</span>
<a name="l15513"><span class="ln">15513 </span></a><span class="s0">abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond,</span>
<a name="l15514"><span class="ln">15514 </span></a><span class="s0">though I might have staid with you till the next morning,</span>
<a name="l15515"><span class="ln">15515 </span></a><span class="s0">merely because I would be as angry with her as possible.  Even then,</span>
<a name="l15516"><span class="ln">15516 </span></a><span class="s0">I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time;</span>
<a name="l15517"><span class="ln">15517 </span></a><span class="s0">but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went</span>
<a name="l15518"><span class="ln">15518 </span></a><span class="s0">away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall</span>
<a name="l15519"><span class="ln">15519 </span></a><span class="s0">always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party.</span>
<a name="l15520"><span class="ln">15520 </span></a><span class="s0">Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would</span>
<a name="l15521"><span class="ln">15521 </span></a><span class="s0">ever have thought well of me again.  Its effect upon her appears</span>
<a name="l15522"><span class="ln">15522 </span></a><span class="s0">in the immediate resolution it produced:  as soon as she found I</span>
<a name="l15523"><span class="ln">15523 </span></a><span class="s0">was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that</span>
<a name="l15524"><span class="ln">15524 </span></a><span class="s0">officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her,</span>
<a name="l15525"><span class="ln">15525 </span></a><span class="s0">by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred.</span>
<a name="l15526"><span class="ln">15526 </span></a><span class="s0">I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been</span>
<a name="l15527"><span class="ln">15527 </span></a><span class="s0">so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly</span>
<a name="l15528"><span class="ln">15528 </span></a><span class="s0">protest against the share of it which that woman has known.--</span>
<a name="l15529"><span class="ln">15529 </span></a><span class="s0">`Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself</span>
<a name="l15530"><span class="ln">15530 </span></a><span class="s0">in calling her by that name, even to you.  Think, then, what I must</span>
<a name="l15531"><span class="ln">15531 </span></a><span class="s0">have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all</span>
<a name="l15532"><span class="ln">15532 </span></a><span class="s0">the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of</span>
<a name="l15533"><span class="ln">15533 </span></a><span class="s0">imaginary superiority.  Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.--</span>
<a name="l15534"><span class="ln">15534 </span></a><span class="s0">She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely,</span>
<a name="l15535"><span class="ln">15535 </span></a><span class="s0">and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.--</span>
<a name="l15536"><span class="ln">15536 </span></a><span class="s0">_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_</span>
<a name="l15537"><span class="ln">15537 </span></a><span class="s0">_to_ _each_:  _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This letter reached me on the very</span>
<a name="l15538"><span class="ln">15538 </span></a><span class="s0">morning of my poor aunt's death.  I answered it within an hour;</span>
<a name="l15539"><span class="ln">15539 </span></a><span class="s0">but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business</span>
<a name="l15540"><span class="ln">15540 </span></a><span class="s0">falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all</span>
<a name="l15541"><span class="ln">15541 </span></a><span class="s0">the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk;</span>
<a name="l15542"><span class="ln">15542 </span></a><span class="s0">and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines,</span>
<a name="l15543"><span class="ln">15543 </span></a><span class="s0">to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather</span>
<a name="l15544"><span class="ln">15544 </span></a><span class="s0">disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily;</span>
<a name="l15545"><span class="ln">15545 </span></a><span class="s0">but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--</span>
<a name="l15546"><span class="ln">15546 </span></a><span class="s0">too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor;</span>
<a name="l15547"><span class="ln">15547 </span></a><span class="s0">and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters</span>
<a name="l15548"><span class="ln">15548 </span></a><span class="s0">all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post,</span>
<a name="l15549"><span class="ln">15549 </span></a><span class="s0">stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply</span>
<a name="l15550"><span class="ln">15550 </span></a><span class="s0">to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could</span>
<a name="l15551"><span class="ln">15551 </span></a><span class="s0">not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both</span>
<a name="l15552"><span class="ln">15552 </span></a><span class="s0">to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible,</span>
<a name="l15553"><span class="ln">15553 </span></a><span class="s0">she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested,</span>
<a name="l15554"><span class="ln">15554 </span></a><span class="s0">that if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them</span>
<a name="l15555"><span class="ln">15555 </span></a><span class="s0">to Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period</span>
<a name="l15556"><span class="ln">15556 </span></a><span class="s0">to her at--:  in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge's,</span>
<a name="l15557"><span class="ln">15557 </span></a><span class="s0">near Bristol, stared me in the face.  I knew the name, the place,</span>
<a name="l15558"><span class="ln">15558 </span></a><span class="s0">I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing.</span>
<a name="l15559"><span class="ln">15559 </span></a><span class="s0">It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character</span>
<a name="l15560"><span class="ln">15560 </span></a><span class="s0">which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained,</span>
<a name="l15561"><span class="ln">15561 </span></a><span class="s0">as to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive</span>
<a name="l15562"><span class="ln">15562 </span></a><span class="s0">of its anxious delicacy.  For the world would not she have seemed</span>
<a name="l15563"><span class="ln">15563 </span></a><span class="s0">to threaten me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually</span>
<a name="l15564"><span class="ln">15564 </span></a><span class="s0">detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--</span>
<a name="l15565"><span class="ln">15565 </span></a><span class="s0">What was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle.</span>
<a name="l15566"><span class="ln">15566 </span></a><span class="s0">Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.--</span>
<a name="l15567"><span class="ln">15567 </span></a><span class="s0">I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened</span>
<a name="l15568"><span class="ln">15568 </span></a><span class="s0">away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,</span>
<a name="l15569"><span class="ln">15569 </span></a><span class="s0">wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!</span>
<a name="l15570"><span class="ln">15570 </span></a><span class="s0">with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness</span>
<a name="l15571"><span class="ln">15571 </span></a><span class="s0">in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be</span>
<a name="l15572"><span class="ln">15572 </span></a><span class="s0">of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must</span>
<a name="l15573"><span class="ln">15573 </span></a><span class="s0">have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while</span>
<a name="l15574"><span class="ln">15574 </span></a><span class="s0">all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury,</span>
<a name="l15575"><span class="ln">15575 </span></a><span class="s0">and saw how ill I had made her.  Do not pity me till I saw her wan,</span>
<a name="l15576"><span class="ln">15576 </span></a><span class="s0">sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my</span>
<a name="l15577"><span class="ln">15577 </span></a><span class="s0">knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance</span>
<a name="l15578"><span class="ln">15578 </span></a><span class="s0">of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was</span>
<a name="l15579"><span class="ln">15579 </span></a><span class="s0">not disappointed either in the object of my journey.  A great deal</span>
<a name="l15580"><span class="ln">15580 </span></a><span class="s0">of very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away.</span>
<a name="l15581"><span class="ln">15581 </span></a><span class="s0">But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever,</span>
<a name="l15582"><span class="ln">15582 </span></a><span class="s0">and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between us again.  Now, my</span>
<a name="l15583"><span class="ln">15583 </span></a><span class="s0">dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude before.</span>
<a name="l15584"><span class="ln">15584 </span></a><span class="s0">A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have</span>
<a name="l15585"><span class="ln">15585 </span></a><span class="s0">ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart</span>
<a name="l15586"><span class="ln">15586 </span></a><span class="s0">will dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier</span>
<a name="l15587"><span class="ln">15587 </span></a><span class="s0">than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me</span>
<a name="l15588"><span class="ln">15588 </span></a><span class="s0">the child of good fortune.  I hope she is right.--In one respect,</span>
<a name="l15589"><span class="ln">15589 </span></a><span class="s0">my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe</span>
<a name="l15590"><span class="ln">15590 </span></a><span class="s0">myself,</span>
<a name="l15591"><span class="ln">15591 </span></a>                    <span class="s0">Your obliged and affectionate Son,</span>

<a name="l15599"><span class="ln">15599 </span></a><span class="s0">This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings.  She was obliged,</span>
<a name="l15600"><span class="ln">15600 </span></a><span class="s0">in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do</span>
<a name="l15601"><span class="ln">15601 </span></a><span class="s0">it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold.  As soon as she</span>
<a name="l15602"><span class="ln">15602 </span></a><span class="s0">came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating</span>
<a name="l15603"><span class="ln">15603 </span></a><span class="s0">to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable;</span>
<a name="l15604"><span class="ln">15604 </span></a><span class="s0">and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself,</span>
<a name="l15605"><span class="ln">15605 </span></a><span class="s0">by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the</span>
<a name="l15606"><span class="ln">15606 </span></a><span class="s0">very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at</span>
<a name="l15607"><span class="ln">15607 </span></a><span class="s0">that moment.  She never stopt till she had gone through the whole;</span>
<a name="l15608"><span class="ln">15608 </span></a><span class="s0">and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong,</span>
<a name="l15609"><span class="ln">15609 </span></a><span class="s0">yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had suffered,</span>
<a name="l15610"><span class="ln">15610 </span></a><span class="s0">and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l15611"><span class="ln">15611 </span></a><span class="s0">and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself,</span>
<a name="l15612"><span class="ln">15612 </span></a><span class="s0">that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room,</span>
<a name="l15613"><span class="ln">15613 </span></a><span class="s0">she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.</span>
<a name="l15614"><span class="ln">15614 </span></a>
<a name="l15615"><span class="ln">15615 </span></a><span class="s0">She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,</span>
<a name="l15616"><span class="ln">15616 </span></a><span class="s0">she desired him to read it.  She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing</span>
<a name="l15617"><span class="ln">15617 </span></a><span class="s0">it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l15618"><span class="ln">15618 </span></a><span class="s0">had seen so much to blame in his conduct.</span>
<a name="l15619"><span class="ln">15619 </span></a>
<a name="l15620"><span class="ln">15620 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I shall be very glad to look it over,&quot; said he; &quot;but it seems long.</span>
<a name="l15621"><span class="ln">15621 </span></a><span class="s0">I will take it home with me at night.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15622"><span class="ln">15622 </span></a>
<a name="l15623"><span class="ln">15623 </span></a><span class="s0">But that would not do.  Mr. Weston was to call in the evening,</span>
<a name="l15624"><span class="ln">15624 </span></a><span class="s0">and she must return it by him.</span>
<a name="l15625"><span class="ln">15625 </span></a>
<a name="l15626"><span class="ln">15626 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I would rather be talking to you,&quot; he replied; &quot;but as it seems</span>
<a name="l15627"><span class="ln">15627 </span></a><span class="s0">a matter of justice, it shall be done.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15628"><span class="ln">15628 </span></a>
<a name="l15629"><span class="ln">15629 </span></a><span class="s0">He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, &quot;Had I been offered</span>
<a name="l15630"><span class="ln">15630 </span></a><span class="s0">the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few</span>
<a name="l15631"><span class="ln">15631 </span></a><span class="s0">months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15632"><span class="ln">15632 </span></a>
<a name="l15633"><span class="ln">15633 </span></a><span class="s0">He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then,</span>
<a name="l15634"><span class="ln">15634 </span></a><span class="s0">with a smile, observed, &quot;Humph! a fine complimentary opening:</span>
<a name="l15635"><span class="ln">15635 </span></a><span class="s0">But it is his way.  One man's style must not be the rule of another's.</span>
<a name="l15636"><span class="ln">15636 </span></a><span class="s0">We will not be severe.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15637"><span class="ln">15637 </span></a>
<a name="l15638"><span class="ln">15638 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It will be natural for me,&quot; he added shortly afterwards, &quot;to speak my</span>
<a name="l15639"><span class="ln">15639 </span></a><span class="s0">opinion aloud as I read.  By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.</span>
<a name="l15640"><span class="ln">15640 </span></a><span class="s0">It will not be so great a loss of time:  but if you dislike it--&quot;</span>
<a name="l15641"><span class="ln">15641 </span></a>
<a name="l15642"><span class="ln">15642 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not at all.  I should wish it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15643"><span class="ln">15643 </span></a>
<a name="l15644"><span class="ln">15644 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.</span>
<a name="l15645"><span class="ln">15645 </span></a>
<a name="l15646"><span class="ln">15646 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He trifles here,&quot; said he, &quot;as to the temptation.  He knows</span>
<a name="l15647"><span class="ln">15647 </span></a><span class="s0">he is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought</span>
<a name="l15648"><span class="ln">15648 </span></a><span class="s0">not to have formed the engagement.--`His father's disposition:'--</span>
<a name="l15649"><span class="ln">15649 </span></a><span class="s0">he is unjust, however, to his father.  Mr. Weston's sanguine</span>
<a name="l15650"><span class="ln">15650 </span></a><span class="s0">temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions;</span>
<a name="l15651"><span class="ln">15651 </span></a><span class="s0">but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured</span>
<a name="l15652"><span class="ln">15652 </span></a><span class="s0">to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15653"><span class="ln">15653 </span></a>
<a name="l15654"><span class="ln">15654 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And I have not forgotten,&quot; said Emma, &quot;how sure you were that he</span>
<a name="l15655"><span class="ln">15655 </span></a><span class="s0">might have come sooner if he would.  You pass it over very handsomely--</span>
<a name="l15656"><span class="ln">15656 </span></a><span class="s0">but you were perfectly right.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15657"><span class="ln">15657 </span></a>
<a name="l15658"><span class="ln">15658 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--</span>
<a name="l15659"><span class="ln">15659 </span></a><span class="s0">had _you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15660"><span class="ln">15660 </span></a>
<a name="l15661"><span class="ln">15661 </span></a><span class="s0">When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole</span>
<a name="l15662"><span class="ln">15662 </span></a><span class="s0">of it aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look;</span>
<a name="l15663"><span class="ln">15663 </span></a><span class="s0">a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation;</span>
<a name="l15664"><span class="ln">15664 </span></a><span class="s0">or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however,</span>
<a name="l15665"><span class="ln">15665 </span></a><span class="s0">seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus--</span>
<a name="l15666"><span class="ln">15666 </span></a>
<a name="l15667"><span class="ln">15667 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most</span>
<a name="l15668"><span class="ln">15668 </span></a><span class="s0">dangerous game.  Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--</span>
<a name="l15669"><span class="ln">15669 </span></a><span class="s0">No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his</span>
<a name="l15670"><span class="ln">15670 </span></a><span class="s0">own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.--</span>
<a name="l15671"><span class="ln">15671 </span></a><span class="s0">Fancying you to have fathomed his secret.  Natural enough!--</span>
<a name="l15672"><span class="ln">15672 </span></a><span class="s0">his own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it</span>
<a name="l15673"><span class="ln">15673 </span></a><span class="s0">in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding!</span>
<a name="l15674"><span class="ln">15674 </span></a><span class="s0">My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the</span>
<a name="l15675"><span class="ln">15675 </span></a><span class="s0">beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?&quot;</span>
<a name="l15676"><span class="ln">15676 </span></a>
<a name="l15677"><span class="ln">15677 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,</span>
<a name="l15678"><span class="ln">15678 </span></a><span class="s0">which she could not give any sincere explanation of.</span>
<a name="l15679"><span class="ln">15679 </span></a>
<a name="l15680"><span class="ln">15680 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You had better go on,&quot; said she.</span>
<a name="l15681"><span class="ln">15681 </span></a>
<a name="l15682"><span class="ln">15682 </span></a><span class="s0">He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, &quot;the pianoforte!</span>
<a name="l15683"><span class="ln">15683 </span></a><span class="s0">Ah!  That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young</span>
<a name="l15684"><span class="ln">15684 </span></a><span class="s0">to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much</span>
<a name="l15685"><span class="ln">15685 </span></a><span class="s0">exceed the pleasure.  A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot</span>
<a name="l15686"><span class="ln">15686 </span></a><span class="s0">comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection</span>
<a name="l15687"><span class="ln">15687 </span></a><span class="s0">which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did</span>
<a name="l15688"><span class="ln">15688 </span></a><span class="s0">know that she would have prevented the instrument's coming if she could.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15689"><span class="ln">15689 </span></a>
<a name="l15690"><span class="ln">15690 </span></a><span class="s0">After this, he made some progress without any pause.</span>

<a name="l15692"><span class="ln">15692 </span></a><span class="s0">was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.</span>
<a name="l15693"><span class="ln">15693 </span></a>
<a name="l15694"><span class="ln">15694 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I perfectly agree with you, sir,&quot;--was then his remark.</span>
<a name="l15695"><span class="ln">15695 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You did behave very shamefully.  You never wrote a truer line.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15696"><span class="ln">15696 </span></a><span class="s0">And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis</span>
<a name="l15697"><span class="ln">15697 </span></a><span class="s0">of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct</span>
<a name="l15698"><span class="ln">15698 </span></a><span class="s0">opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he made a fuller pause</span>
<a name="l15699"><span class="ln">15699 </span></a><span class="s0">to say, &quot;This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself,</span>
<a name="l15700"><span class="ln">15700 </span></a><span class="s0">for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness,</span>
<a name="l15701"><span class="ln">15701 </span></a><span class="s0">and it should have been his first object to prevent her from</span>
<a name="l15702"><span class="ln">15702 </span></a><span class="s0">suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with,</span>
<a name="l15703"><span class="ln">15703 </span></a><span class="s0">in carrying on the correspondence, than he could.  He should have</span>
<a name="l15704"><span class="ln">15704 </span></a><span class="s0">respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers</span>
<a name="l15705"><span class="ln">15705 </span></a><span class="s0">were all reasonable.  We must look to her one fault, and remember</span>
<a name="l15706"><span class="ln">15706 </span></a><span class="s0">that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement,</span>
<a name="l15707"><span class="ln">15707 </span></a><span class="s0">to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15708"><span class="ln">15708 </span></a>
<a name="l15709"><span class="ln">15709 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party,</span>
<a name="l15710"><span class="ln">15710 </span></a><span class="s0">and grew uncomfortable.  Her own behaviour had been so very improper!</span>
<a name="l15711"><span class="ln">15711 </span></a><span class="s0">She was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look.</span>
<a name="l15712"><span class="ln">15712 </span></a><span class="s0">It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without</span>
<a name="l15713"><span class="ln">15713 </span></a><span class="s0">the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her,</span>
<a name="l15714"><span class="ln">15714 </span></a><span class="s0">instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance</span>
<a name="l15715"><span class="ln">15715 </span></a><span class="s0">of Box Hill seemed to exist.</span>
<a name="l15716"><span class="ln">15716 </span></a>
<a name="l15717"><span class="ln">15717 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends,</span>
<a name="l15718"><span class="ln">15718 </span></a><span class="s0">the Eltons,&quot; was his next observation.--&quot;His feelings are natural.--</span>
<a name="l15719"><span class="ln">15719 </span></a><span class="s0">What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt</span>
<a name="l15720"><span class="ln">15720 </span></a><span class="s0">the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each--</span>
<a name="l15721"><span class="ln">15721 </span></a><span class="s0">she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of</span>
<a name="l15722"><span class="ln">15722 </span></a><span class="s0">his behaviour!--Well, he must be a most extraordinary--&quot;</span>
<a name="l15723"><span class="ln">15723 </span></a>
<a name="l15724"><span class="ln">15724 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15725"><span class="ln">15725 </span></a>
<a name="l15726"><span class="ln">15726 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope he does,&quot; replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.</span>
<a name="l15727"><span class="ln">15727 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;`Smallridge!'--What does this mean?  What is all this?&quot;</span>
<a name="l15728"><span class="ln">15728 </span></a>
<a name="l15729"><span class="ln">15729 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--</span>
<a name="l15730"><span class="ln">15730 </span></a><span class="s0">a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and,</span>
<a name="l15731"><span class="ln">15731 </span></a><span class="s0">by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?&quot;</span>
<a name="l15732"><span class="ln">15732 </span></a>
<a name="l15733"><span class="ln">15733 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even</span>
<a name="l15734"><span class="ln">15734 </span></a><span class="s0">of Mrs. Elton.  Only one page more.  I shall soon have done.</span>
<a name="l15735"><span class="ln">15735 </span></a><span class="s0">What a letter the man writes!&quot;</span>
<a name="l15736"><span class="ln">15736 </span></a>
<a name="l15737"><span class="ln">15737 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15738"><span class="ln">15738 </span></a>
<a name="l15739"><span class="ln">15739 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Well, there _is_ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding</span>
<a name="l15740"><span class="ln">15740 </span></a><span class="s0">her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of her.</span>
<a name="l15741"><span class="ln">15741 </span></a><span class="s0">`Dearer, much dearer than ever.'  I hope he may long continue to feel</span>
<a name="l15742"><span class="ln">15742 </span></a><span class="s0">all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker,</span>
<a name="l15743"><span class="ln">15743 </span></a><span class="s0">with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve.'</span>
<a name="l15744"><span class="ln">15744 </span></a><span class="s0">Come, he knows himself there.  `Miss Woodhouse calls me the child</span>
<a name="l15745"><span class="ln">15745 </span></a><span class="s0">of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--</span>
<a name="l15746"><span class="ln">15746 </span></a><span class="s0">And a fine ending--and there is the letter.  The child of good fortune!</span>
<a name="l15747"><span class="ln">15747 </span></a><span class="s0">That was your name for him, was it?&quot;</span>
<a name="l15748"><span class="ln">15748 </span></a>
<a name="l15749"><span class="ln">15749 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am;</span>
<a name="l15750"><span class="ln">15750 </span></a><span class="s0">but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better</span>
<a name="l15751"><span class="ln">15751 </span></a><span class="s0">of him for it.  I hope it does him some service with you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15752"><span class="ln">15752 </span></a>
<a name="l15753"><span class="ln">15753 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, certainly it does.  He has had great faults, faults of</span>
<a name="l15754"><span class="ln">15754 </span></a><span class="s0">inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his</span>
<a name="l15755"><span class="ln">15755 </span></a><span class="s0">opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves:</span>
<a name="l15756"><span class="ln">15756 </span></a><span class="s0">but still as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax,</span>
<a name="l15757"><span class="ln">15757 </span></a><span class="s0">and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly</span>
<a name="l15758"><span class="ln">15758 </span></a><span class="s0">with her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve,</span>
<a name="l15759"><span class="ln">15759 </span></a><span class="s0">and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle</span>
<a name="l15760"><span class="ln">15760 </span></a><span class="s0">that it wants.  And now, let me talk to you of something else.</span>
<a name="l15761"><span class="ln">15761 </span></a><span class="s0">I have another person's interest at present so much at heart,</span>
<a name="l15762"><span class="ln">15762 </span></a><span class="s0">that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.  Ever since I</span>
<a name="l15763"><span class="ln">15763 </span></a><span class="s0">left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on</span>
<a name="l15764"><span class="ln">15764 </span></a><span class="s0">one subject.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15765"><span class="ln">15765 </span></a>
<a name="l15766"><span class="ln">15766 </span></a><span class="s0">The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English,</span>
<a name="l15767"><span class="ln">15767 </span></a><span class="s0">such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with,</span>
<a name="l15768"><span class="ln">15768 </span></a><span class="s0">how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the</span>
<a name="l15769"><span class="ln">15769 </span></a><span class="s0">happiness of her father.  Emma's answer was ready at the first word.</span>
<a name="l15770"><span class="ln">15770 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible</span>
<a name="l15771"><span class="ln">15771 </span></a><span class="s0">for her.  She could never quit him.&quot;  Part only of this answer,</span>
<a name="l15772"><span class="ln">15772 </span></a><span class="s0">however, was admitted.  The impossibility of her quitting her father,</span>
<a name="l15773"><span class="ln">15773 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility</span>
<a name="l15774"><span class="ln">15774 </span></a><span class="s0">of any other change, he could not agree to.  He had been thinking</span>
<a name="l15775"><span class="ln">15775 </span></a><span class="s0">it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce</span>
<a name="l15776"><span class="ln">15776 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe</span>
<a name="l15777"><span class="ln">15777 </span></a><span class="s0">it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer</span>
<a name="l15778"><span class="ln">15778 </span></a><span class="s0">him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion,</span>
<a name="l15779"><span class="ln">15779 </span></a><span class="s0">that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort,</span>
<a name="l15780"><span class="ln">15780 </span></a><span class="s0">perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded.  Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l15781"><span class="ln">15781 </span></a><span class="s0">taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted.</span>
<a name="l15782"><span class="ln">15782 </span></a><span class="s0">But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted</span>
<a name="l15783"><span class="ln">15783 </span></a><span class="s0">his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;</span>
<a name="l15784"><span class="ln">15784 </span></a><span class="s0">it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as</span>
<a name="l15785"><span class="ln">15785 </span></a><span class="s0">her father's happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield</span>
<a name="l15786"><span class="ln">15786 </span></a><span class="s0">to continue her home, it should be his likewise.</span>
<a name="l15787"><span class="ln">15787 </span></a>
<a name="l15788"><span class="ln">15788 </span></a><span class="s0">Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own</span>
<a name="l15789"><span class="ln">15789 </span></a><span class="s0">passing thoughts.  Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it;</span>
<a name="l15790"><span class="ln">15790 </span></a><span class="s0">but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her.</span>
<a name="l15791"><span class="ln">15791 </span></a><span class="s0">She was sensible of all the affection it evinced.  She felt that,</span>
<a name="l15792"><span class="ln">15792 </span></a><span class="s0">in quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence</span>
<a name="l15793"><span class="ln">15793 </span></a><span class="s0">of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father,</span>
<a name="l15794"><span class="ln">15794 </span></a><span class="s0">and in no house of his own, there would be much, very much,</span>
<a name="l15795"><span class="ln">15795 </span></a><span class="s0">to be borne with.  She promised to think of it, and advised him</span>
<a name="l15796"><span class="ln">15796 </span></a><span class="s0">to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection</span>
<a name="l15797"><span class="ln">15797 </span></a><span class="s0">could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject.  He had</span>
<a name="l15798"><span class="ln">15798 </span></a><span class="s0">given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration;</span>
<a name="l15799"><span class="ln">15799 </span></a><span class="s0">he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning,</span>
<a name="l15800"><span class="ln">15800 </span></a><span class="s0">to have his thoughts to himself.</span>
<a name="l15801"><span class="ln">15801 </span></a>
<a name="l15802"><span class="ln">15802 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,&quot; cried Emma.  &quot;I am</span>
<a name="l15803"><span class="ln">15803 </span></a><span class="s0">sure William Larkins will not like it.  You must get his consent</span>
<a name="l15804"><span class="ln">15804 </span></a><span class="s0">before you ask mine.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15805"><span class="ln">15805 </span></a>
<a name="l15806"><span class="ln">15806 </span></a><span class="s0">She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover,</span>
<a name="l15807"><span class="ln">15807 </span></a><span class="s0">to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.</span>
<a name="l15808"><span class="ln">15808 </span></a>
<a name="l15809"><span class="ln">15809 </span></a><span class="s0">It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view</span>
<a name="l15810"><span class="ln">15810 </span></a><span class="s0">in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never</span>
<a name="l15811"><span class="ln">15811 </span></a><span class="s0">struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights</span>
<a name="l15812"><span class="ln">15812 </span></a><span class="s0">as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded.</span>
<a name="l15813"><span class="ln">15813 </span></a><span class="s0">Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy;</span>
<a name="l15814"><span class="ln">15814 </span></a><span class="s0">and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it,</span>
<a name="l15815"><span class="ln">15815 </span></a><span class="s0">and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent</span>
<a name="l15816"><span class="ln">15816 </span></a><span class="s0">dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else,</span>
<a name="l15817"><span class="ln">15817 </span></a><span class="s0">which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of</span>
<a name="l15818"><span class="ln">15818 </span></a><span class="s0">the sister and the aunt.</span>
<a name="l15819"><span class="ln">15819 </span></a>
<a name="l15820"><span class="ln">15820 </span></a><span class="s0">This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--</span>
<a name="l15821"><span class="ln">15821 </span></a><span class="s0">the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.</span>
<a name="l15822"><span class="ln">15822 </span></a><span class="s0">His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase,</span>
<a name="l15823"><span class="ln">15823 </span></a><span class="s0">their mutual good to outweigh every drawback.  Such a companion</span>
<a name="l15824"><span class="ln">15824 </span></a><span class="s0">for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--</span>
<a name="l15825"><span class="ln">15825 </span></a><span class="s0">Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be</span>
<a name="l15826"><span class="ln">15826 </span></a><span class="s0">giving increase of melancholy!</span>
<a name="l15827"><span class="ln">15827 </span></a>
<a name="l15828"><span class="ln">15828 </span></a><span class="s0">She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every</span>
<a name="l15829"><span class="ln">15829 </span></a><span class="s0">blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings</span>
<a name="l15830"><span class="ln">15830 </span></a><span class="s0">of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.</span>
<a name="l15831"><span class="ln">15831 </span></a><span class="s0">The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself,</span>
<a name="l15832"><span class="ln">15832 </span></a><span class="s0">poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a</span>
<a name="l15833"><span class="ln">15833 </span></a><span class="s0">distance from.  She would be a loser in every way.  Emma could not</span>
<a name="l15834"><span class="ln">15834 </span></a><span class="s0">deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment.</span>
<a name="l15835"><span class="ln">15835 </span></a><span class="s0">In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;</span>
<a name="l15836"><span class="ln">15836 </span></a><span class="s0">but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity</span>
<a name="l15837"><span class="ln">15837 </span></a><span class="s0">that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.</span>
<a name="l15838"><span class="ln">15838 </span></a>
<a name="l15839"><span class="ln">15839 </span></a><span class="s0">In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,</span>
<a name="l15840"><span class="ln">15840 </span></a><span class="s0">supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.</span>
<a name="l15841"><span class="ln">15841 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--</span>
<a name="l15842"><span class="ln">15842 </span></a><span class="s0">not like Mr. Elton.  Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling,</span>
<a name="l15843"><span class="ln">15843 </span></a><span class="s0">so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be</span>
<a name="l15844"><span class="ln">15844 </span></a><span class="s0">less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even</span>
<a name="l15845"><span class="ln">15845 </span></a><span class="s0">of Harriet, that she could be in love with more than _three_ men</span>
<a name="l15846"><span class="ln">15846 </span></a><span class="s0">in one year.</span>
<a name="l15847"><span class="ln">15847 </span></a>

<a name="l15851"><span class="ln">15851 </span></a>
<a name="l15852"><span class="ln">15852 </span></a>
<a name="l15853"><span class="ln">15853 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous</span>
<a name="l15854"><span class="ln">15854 </span></a><span class="s0">as herself to avoid a meeting.  Their intercourse was painful</span>
<a name="l15855"><span class="ln">15855 </span></a><span class="s0">enough by letter.  How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!</span>
<a name="l15856"><span class="ln">15856 </span></a>
<a name="l15857"><span class="ln">15857 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,</span>
<a name="l15858"><span class="ln">15858 </span></a><span class="s0">without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied</span>
<a name="l15859"><span class="ln">15859 </span></a><span class="s0">there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in</span>
<a name="l15860"><span class="ln">15860 </span></a><span class="s0">her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--</span>
<a name="l15861"><span class="ln">15861 </span></a><span class="s0">It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an</span>
<a name="l15862"><span class="ln">15862 </span></a><span class="s0">angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.</span>
<a name="l15863"><span class="ln">15863 </span></a>
<a name="l15864"><span class="ln">15864 </span></a><span class="s0">She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;</span>
<a name="l15865"><span class="ln">15865 </span></a><span class="s0">and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,</span>
<a name="l15866"><span class="ln">15866 </span></a><span class="s0">without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.</span>
<a name="l15867"><span class="ln">15867 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.</span>
<a name="l15868"><span class="ln">15868 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill</span>
<a name="l15869"><span class="ln">15869 </span></a><span class="s0">health was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a</span>
<a name="l15870"><span class="ln">15870 </span></a><span class="s0">dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet</span>
<a name="l15871"><span class="ln">15871 </span></a><span class="s0">under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side,</span>
<a name="l15872"><span class="ln">15872 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.--</span>
<a name="l15873"><span class="ln">15873 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was</span>
<a name="l15874"><span class="ln">15874 </span></a><span class="s0">to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged,</span>
<a name="l15875"><span class="ln">15875 </span></a><span class="s0">it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.</span>
<a name="l15876"><span class="ln">15876 </span></a>
<a name="l15877"><span class="ln">15877 </span></a><span class="s0">Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she</span>
<a name="l15878"><span class="ln">15878 </span></a><span class="s0">could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by</span>
<a name="l15879"><span class="ln">15879 </span></a><span class="s0">that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful,</span>
<a name="l15880"><span class="ln">15880 </span></a><span class="s0">which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was</span>
<a name="l15881"><span class="ln">15881 </span></a><span class="s0">near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,</span>
<a name="l15882"><span class="ln">15882 </span></a><span class="s0">be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.</span>
<a name="l15883"><span class="ln">15883 </span></a>
<a name="l15884"><span class="ln">15884 </span></a><span class="s0">The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps</span>
<a name="l15885"><span class="ln">15885 </span></a><span class="s0">an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not</span>
<a name="l15886"><span class="ln">15886 </span></a><span class="s0">think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,</span>
<a name="l15887"><span class="ln">15887 </span></a><span class="s0">which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.</span>
<a name="l15888"><span class="ln">15888 </span></a>
<a name="l15889"><span class="ln">15889 </span></a><span class="s0">She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place</span>
<a name="l15890"><span class="ln">15890 </span></a><span class="s0">in her mind which Harriet had occupied.  There was a communication</span>
<a name="l15891"><span class="ln">15891 </span></a><span class="s0">before her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--</span>
<a name="l15892"><span class="ln">15892 </span></a><span class="s0">the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would</span>
<a name="l15893"><span class="ln">15893 </span></a><span class="s0">have nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer</span>
<a name="l15894"><span class="ln">15894 </span></a><span class="s0">the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.  No additional</span>
<a name="l15895"><span class="ln">15895 </span></a><span class="s0">agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved--</span>
<a name="l15896"><span class="ln">15896 </span></a><span class="s0">and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the</span>
<a name="l15897"><span class="ln">15897 </span></a><span class="s0">appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,</span>
<a name="l15898"><span class="ln">15898 </span></a><span class="s0">to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.</span>
<a name="l15899"><span class="ln">15899 </span></a>
<a name="l15900"><span class="ln">15900 </span></a><span class="s0">She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half</span>
<a name="l15901"><span class="ln">15901 </span></a><span class="s0">an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--</span>
<a name="l15902"><span class="ln">15902 </span></a><span class="s0">She ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of</span>
<a name="l15903"><span class="ln">15903 </span></a><span class="s0">their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.</span>
<a name="l15904"><span class="ln">15904 </span></a><span class="s0">It would be a _secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a</span>
<a name="l15905"><span class="ln">15905 </span></a><span class="s0">similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with</span>
<a name="l15906"><span class="ln">15906 </span></a><span class="s0">which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.</span>
<a name="l15907"><span class="ln">15907 </span></a>
<a name="l15908"><span class="ln">15908 </span></a><span class="s0">She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had</span>
<a name="l15909"><span class="ln">15909 </span></a><span class="s0">not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor</span>
<a name="l15910"><span class="ln">15910 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,</span>
<a name="l15911"><span class="ln">15911 </span></a><span class="s0">though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--</span>
<a name="l15912"><span class="ln">15912 </span></a><span class="s0">The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured</span>
<a name="l15913"><span class="ln">15913 </span></a><span class="s0">of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--</span>
<a name="l15914"><span class="ln">15914 </span></a><span class="s0">She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor</span>
<a name="l15915"><span class="ln">15915 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard</span>
<a name="l15916"><span class="ln">15916 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing but the instant reply of, &quot;Beg her to walk up;&quot;--and a moment</span>
<a name="l15917"><span class="ln">15917 </span></a><span class="s0">afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly</span>
<a name="l15918"><span class="ln">15918 </span></a><span class="s0">forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--</span>
<a name="l15919"><span class="ln">15919 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.</span>
<a name="l15920"><span class="ln">15920 </span></a><span class="s0">There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every</span>
<a name="l15921"><span class="ln">15921 </span></a><span class="s0">thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--</span>
<a name="l15922"><span class="ln">15922 </span></a><span class="s0">She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very</span>
<a name="l15923"><span class="ln">15923 </span></a><span class="s0">feeling tone,</span>
<a name="l15924"><span class="ln">15924 </span></a>
<a name="l15925"><span class="ln">15925 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible</span>
<a name="l15926"><span class="ln">15926 </span></a><span class="s0">for me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being</span>
<a name="l15927"><span class="ln">15927 </span></a><span class="s0">so entirely without words.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15928"><span class="ln">15928 </span></a>
<a name="l15929"><span class="ln">15929 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,</span>
<a name="l15930"><span class="ln">15930 </span></a><span class="s0">if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not</span>
<a name="l15931"><span class="ln">15931 </span></a><span class="s0">checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly</span>
<a name="l15932"><span class="ln">15932 </span></a><span class="s0">and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest</span>
<a name="l15933"><span class="ln">15933 </span></a><span class="s0">shake of the hand.</span>
<a name="l15934"><span class="ln">15934 </span></a>
<a name="l15935"><span class="ln">15935 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.  Miss Bates was out,</span>
<a name="l15936"><span class="ln">15936 </span></a><span class="s0">which accounted for the previous tranquillity.  Emma could have</span>
<a name="l15937"><span class="ln">15937 </span></a><span class="s0">wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience</span>
<a name="l15938"><span class="ln">15938 </span></a><span class="s0">with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,</span>
<a name="l15939"><span class="ln">15939 </span></a><span class="s0">she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.</span>
<a name="l15940"><span class="ln">15940 </span></a>
<a name="l15941"><span class="ln">15941 </span></a><span class="s0">She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts,</span>
<a name="l15942"><span class="ln">15942 </span></a><span class="s0">and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits;</span>
<a name="l15943"><span class="ln">15943 </span></a><span class="s0">it was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself</span>
<a name="l15944"><span class="ln">15944 </span></a><span class="s0">acquainted with what was still a secret to other people.</span>
<a name="l15945"><span class="ln">15945 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face;</span>
<a name="l15946"><span class="ln">15946 </span></a><span class="s0">and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing</span>
<a name="l15947"><span class="ln">15947 </span></a><span class="s0">to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort</span>
<a name="l15948"><span class="ln">15948 </span></a><span class="s0">of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently</span>
<a name="l15949"><span class="ln">15949 </span></a><span class="s0">been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple</span>
<a name="l15950"><span class="ln">15950 </span></a><span class="s0">and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,</span>
<a name="l15951"><span class="ln">15951 </span></a>
<a name="l15952"><span class="ln">15952 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We can finish this some other time, you know.  You and I shall</span>
<a name="l15953"><span class="ln">15953 </span></a><span class="s0">not want opportunities.  And, in fact, you have heard all the</span>
<a name="l15954"><span class="ln">15954 </span></a><span class="s0">essential already.  I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits</span>
<a name="l15955"><span class="ln">15955 </span></a><span class="s0">our apology, and is not offended.  You see how delightfully</span>
<a name="l15956"><span class="ln">15956 </span></a><span class="s0">she writes.  Oh! she is a sweet creature!  You would have doated</span>
<a name="l15957"><span class="ln">15957 </span></a><span class="s0">on her, had you gone.--But not a word more.  Let us be discreet--</span>
<a name="l15958"><span class="ln">15958 </span></a><span class="s0">quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines--</span>
<a name="l15959"><span class="ln">15959 </span></a><span class="s0">I forget the poem at this moment:</span>
<a name="l15960"><span class="ln">15960 </span></a>
<a name="l15961"><span class="ln">15961 </span></a>        <span class="s0">&quot;For when a lady's in the case,</span>
<a name="l15962"><span class="ln">15962 </span></a>        <span class="s0">&quot;You know all other things give place.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15963"><span class="ln">15963 </span></a>
<a name="l15964"><span class="ln">15964 </span></a><span class="s0">Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word</span>
<a name="l15965"><span class="ln">15965 </span></a><span class="s0">to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I?  But I want</span>
<a name="l15966"><span class="ln">15966 </span></a><span class="s0">to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see,</span>
<a name="l15967"><span class="ln">15967 </span></a><span class="s0">has quite appeased her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15968"><span class="ln">15968 </span></a>
<a name="l15969"><span class="ln">15969 </span></a><span class="s0">And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look</span>
<a name="l15970"><span class="ln">15970 </span></a><span class="s0">at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,</span>
<a name="l15971"><span class="ln">15971 </span></a>
<a name="l15972"><span class="ln">15972 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as</span>
<a name="l15973"><span class="ln">15973 </span></a><span class="s0">a minister of state.  I managed it extremely well.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15974"><span class="ln">15974 </span></a>
<a name="l15975"><span class="ln">15975 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not doubt.  It was a palpable display, repeated on every</span>
<a name="l15976"><span class="ln">15976 </span></a><span class="s0">possible occasion.  When they had all talked a little while in harmony</span>
<a name="l15977"><span class="ln">15977 </span></a><span class="s0">of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,</span>
<a name="l15978"><span class="ln">15978 </span></a>
<a name="l15979"><span class="ln">15979 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is</span>
<a name="l15980"><span class="ln">15980 </span></a><span class="s0">charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the</span>
<a name="l15981"><span class="ln">15981 </span></a><span class="s0">highest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)</span>
<a name="l15982"><span class="ln">15982 </span></a><span class="s0">Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--</span>
<a name="l15983"><span class="ln">15983 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!&quot;--</span>
<a name="l15984"><span class="ln">15984 </span></a><span class="s0">And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,</span>
<a name="l15985"><span class="ln">15985 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have;</span>
<a name="l15986"><span class="ln">15986 </span></a><span class="s0">not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no;</span>
<a name="l15987"><span class="ln">15987 </span></a><span class="s0">Perry shall have all the credit.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15988"><span class="ln">15988 </span></a>
<a name="l15989"><span class="ln">15989 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,&quot;</span>
<a name="l15990"><span class="ln">15990 </span></a><span class="s0">she shortly afterwards began, &quot;since the party to Box Hill.</span>
<a name="l15991"><span class="ln">15991 </span></a><span class="s0">Very pleasant party.  But yet I think there was something wanting.</span>
<a name="l15992"><span class="ln">15992 </span></a><span class="s0">Things did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon</span>
<a name="l15993"><span class="ln">15993 </span></a><span class="s0">the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might</span>
<a name="l15994"><span class="ln">15994 </span></a><span class="s0">be mistaken.  However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one</span>
<a name="l15995"><span class="ln">15995 </span></a><span class="s0">to go again.  What say you both to our collecting the same party,</span>
<a name="l15996"><span class="ln">15996 </span></a><span class="s0">and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?--</span>
<a name="l15997"><span class="ln">15997 </span></a><span class="s0">It must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,</span>
<a name="l15998"><span class="ln">15998 </span></a><span class="s0">not _one_ exception.&quot;</span>
<a name="l15999"><span class="ln">15999 </span></a>
<a name="l16000"><span class="ln">16000 </span></a><span class="s0">Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted</span>
<a name="l16001"><span class="ln">16001 </span></a><span class="s0">by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,</span>
<a name="l16002"><span class="ln">16002 </span></a><span class="s0">from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.</span>
<a name="l16003"><span class="ln">16003 </span></a>
<a name="l16004"><span class="ln">16004 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible</span>
<a name="l16005"><span class="ln">16005 </span></a><span class="s0">to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--</span>
<a name="l16006"><span class="ln">16006 </span></a><span class="s0">that is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--</span>
<a name="l16007"><span class="ln">16007 </span></a><span class="s0">How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--</span>
<a name="l16008"><span class="ln">16008 </span></a><span class="s0">Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--</span>
<a name="l16009"><span class="ln">16009 </span></a><span class="s0">Charming young man!--that is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--</span>
<a name="l16010"><span class="ln">16010 </span></a><span class="s0">such attention to Jane!&quot;--And from her great, her more than commonly</span>
<a name="l16011"><span class="ln">16011 </span></a><span class="s0">thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed</span>
<a name="l16012"><span class="ln">16012 </span></a><span class="s0">that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane,</span>
<a name="l16013"><span class="ln">16013 </span></a><span class="s0">from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.--</span>
<a name="l16014"><span class="ln">16014 </span></a><span class="s0">After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess,</span>
<a name="l16015"><span class="ln">16015 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,</span>
<a name="l16016"><span class="ln">16016 </span></a>
<a name="l16017"><span class="ln">16017 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,</span>
<a name="l16018"><span class="ln">16018 </span></a><span class="s0">that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise;</span>
<a name="l16019"><span class="ln">16019 </span></a><span class="s0">but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.</span>
<a name="l16020"><span class="ln">16020 </span></a><span class="s0">He promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16021"><span class="ln">16021 </span></a>
<a name="l16022"><span class="ln">16022 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--</span>
<a name="l16023"><span class="ln">16023 </span></a><span class="s0">That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like</span>
<a name="l16024"><span class="ln">16024 </span></a><span class="s0">morning visits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16025"><span class="ln">16025 </span></a>
<a name="l16026"><span class="ln">16026 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning</span>
<a name="l16027"><span class="ln">16027 </span></a><span class="s0">to night.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretence</span>
<a name="l16028"><span class="ln">16028 </span></a><span class="s0">or other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens,</span>
<a name="l16029"><span class="ln">16029 </span></a><span class="s0">are always wanting his opinion.  They seem not able to do any thing</span>
<a name="l16030"><span class="ln">16030 </span></a><span class="s0">without him.--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than I.--</span>
<a name="l16031"><span class="ln">16031 </span></a><span class="s0">I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument,</span>
<a name="l16032"><span class="ln">16032 </span></a><span class="s0">if I had half so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I</span>
<a name="l16033"><span class="ln">16033 </span></a><span class="s0">absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe</span>
<a name="l16034"><span class="ln">16034 </span></a><span class="s0">I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However, he is coming,</span>
<a name="l16035"><span class="ln">16035 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you:  yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.&quot;  And putting</span>
<a name="l16036"><span class="ln">16036 </span></a><span class="s0">up her hand to screen her words from Emma--&quot;A congratulatory visit,</span>
<a name="l16037"><span class="ln">16037 </span></a><span class="s0">you know.--Oh! yes, quite indispensable.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16038"><span class="ln">16038 </span></a>
<a name="l16039"><span class="ln">16039 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!--</span>
<a name="l16040"><span class="ln">16040 </span></a>
<a name="l16041"><span class="ln">16041 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself</span>
<a name="l16042"><span class="ln">16042 </span></a><span class="s0">from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together</span>
<a name="l16043"><span class="ln">16043 </span></a><span class="s0">in deep consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16044"><span class="ln">16044 </span></a>
<a name="l16045"><span class="ln">16045 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, &quot;Is Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l16046"><span class="ln">16046 </span></a><span class="s0">gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16047"><span class="ln">16047 </span></a>
<a name="l16048"><span class="ln">16048 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting.</span>
<a name="l16049"><span class="ln">16049 </span></a><span class="s0">Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only</span>
<a name="l16050"><span class="ln">16050 </span></a><span class="s0">of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing</span>
<a name="l16051"><span class="ln">16051 </span></a><span class="s0">their own way.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16052"><span class="ln">16052 </span></a>
<a name="l16053"><span class="ln">16053 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Have not you mistaken the day?&quot; said Emma.  &quot;I am almost certain</span>
<a name="l16054"><span class="ln">16054 </span></a><span class="s0">that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley</span>
<a name="l16055"><span class="ln">16055 </span></a><span class="s0">was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16056"><span class="ln">16056 </span></a>
<a name="l16057"><span class="ln">16057 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,&quot; was the abrupt answer,</span>
<a name="l16058"><span class="ln">16058 </span></a><span class="s0">which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--</span>
<a name="l16059"><span class="ln">16059 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do believe,&quot; she continued, &quot;this is the most troublesome parish</span>
<a name="l16060"><span class="ln">16060 </span></a><span class="s0">that ever was.  We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16061"><span class="ln">16061 </span></a>
<a name="l16062"><span class="ln">16062 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Your parish there was small,&quot; said Jane.</span>
<a name="l16063"><span class="ln">16063 </span></a>
<a name="l16064"><span class="ln">16064 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject</span>
<a name="l16065"><span class="ln">16065 </span></a><span class="s0">talked of.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16066"><span class="ln">16066 </span></a>
<a name="l16067"><span class="ln">16067 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard</span>
<a name="l16068"><span class="ln">16068 </span></a><span class="s0">you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;</span>
<a name="l16069"><span class="ln">16069 </span></a><span class="s0">the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16070"><span class="ln">16070 </span></a>
<a name="l16071"><span class="ln">16071 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! you clever creature, that's very true.  What a thinking brain</span>
<a name="l16072"><span class="ln">16072 </span></a><span class="s0">you have!  I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make,</span>
<a name="l16073"><span class="ln">16073 </span></a><span class="s0">if we could be shaken together.  My liveliness and your solidity</span>
<a name="l16074"><span class="ln">16074 </span></a><span class="s0">would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however,</span>
<a name="l16075"><span class="ln">16075 </span></a><span class="s0">that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--</span>
<a name="l16076"><span class="ln">16076 </span></a><span class="s0">not a word, if you please.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16077"><span class="ln">16077 </span></a>
<a name="l16078"><span class="ln">16078 </span></a><span class="s0">It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,</span>
<a name="l16079"><span class="ln">16079 </span></a><span class="s0">not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.</span>
<a name="l16080"><span class="ln">16080 </span></a><span class="s0">The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted,</span>
<a name="l16081"><span class="ln">16081 </span></a><span class="s0">was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.</span>
<a name="l16082"><span class="ln">16082 </span></a>
<a name="l16083"><span class="ln">16083 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton made his appearance.  His lady greeted him with some</span>
<a name="l16084"><span class="ln">16084 </span></a><span class="s0">of her sparkling vivacity.</span>
<a name="l16085"><span class="ln">16085 </span></a>
<a name="l16086"><span class="ln">16086 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an</span>
<a name="l16087"><span class="ln">16087 </span></a><span class="s0">encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--</span>
<a name="l16088"><span class="ln">16088 </span></a><span class="s0">But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.</span>
<a name="l16089"><span class="ln">16089 </span></a><span class="s0">You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.--</span>
<a name="l16090"><span class="ln">16090 </span></a><span class="s0">Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies</span>
<a name="l16091"><span class="ln">16091 </span></a><span class="s0">a sample of true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know,</span>
<a name="l16092"><span class="ln">16092 </span></a><span class="s0">how soon it may be wanted?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16093"><span class="ln">16093 </span></a>
<a name="l16094"><span class="ln">16094 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.</span>
<a name="l16095"><span class="ln">16095 </span></a><span class="s0">His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent</span>
<a name="l16096"><span class="ln">16096 </span></a><span class="s0">object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering,</span>
<a name="l16097"><span class="ln">16097 </span></a><span class="s0">and the walk he had had for nothing.</span>
<a name="l16098"><span class="ln">16098 </span></a>
<a name="l16099"><span class="ln">16099 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;When I got to Donwell,&quot; said he, &quot;Knightley could not be found.</span>
<a name="l16100"><span class="ln">16100 </span></a><span class="s0">Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,</span>
<a name="l16101"><span class="ln">16101 </span></a><span class="s0">and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home</span>
<a name="l16102"><span class="ln">16102 </span></a><span class="s0">till one.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16103"><span class="ln">16103 </span></a>
<a name="l16104"><span class="ln">16104 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Donwell!&quot; cried his wife.--&quot;My dear Mr. E., you have not been</span>
<a name="l16105"><span class="ln">16105 </span></a><span class="s0">to Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16106"><span class="ln">16106 </span></a>
<a name="l16107"><span class="ln">16107 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley</span>
<a name="l16108"><span class="ln">16108 </span></a><span class="s0">to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--</span>
<a name="l16109"><span class="ln">16109 </span></a><span class="s0">I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,)</span>
<a name="l16110"><span class="ln">16110 </span></a><span class="s0">which made it so much the worse.  And then not to find him at home!</span>
<a name="l16111"><span class="ln">16111 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you I am not at all pleased.  And no apology left, no message</span>
<a name="l16112"><span class="ln">16112 </span></a><span class="s0">for me.  The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--</span>
<a name="l16113"><span class="ln">16113 </span></a><span class="s0">Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone.</span>
<a name="l16114"><span class="ln">16114 </span></a><span class="s0">Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--</span>
<a name="l16115"><span class="ln">16115 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you</span>
<a name="l16116"><span class="ln">16116 </span></a><span class="s0">explain it?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16117"><span class="ln">16117 </span></a>
<a name="l16118"><span class="ln">16118 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,</span>
<a name="l16119"><span class="ln">16119 </span></a><span class="s0">indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.</span>
<a name="l16120"><span class="ln">16120 </span></a>
<a name="l16121"><span class="ln">16121 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I cannot imagine,&quot; said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife</span>
<a name="l16122"><span class="ln">16122 </span></a><span class="s0">ought to do,) &quot;I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you,</span>
<a name="l16123"><span class="ln">16123 </span></a><span class="s0">of all people in the world!  The very last person whom one should expect</span>
<a name="l16124"><span class="ln">16124 </span></a><span class="s0">to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you,</span>
<a name="l16125"><span class="ln">16125 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--</span>
<a name="l16126"><span class="ln">16126 </span></a><span class="s0">and his servants forgot it.  Depend upon it, that was the case:</span>
<a name="l16127"><span class="ln">16127 </span></a><span class="s0">and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,</span>
<a name="l16128"><span class="ln">16128 </span></a><span class="s0">I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I</span>
<a name="l16129"><span class="ln">16129 </span></a><span class="s0">would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard</span>
<a name="l16130"><span class="ln">16130 </span></a><span class="s0">for any consideration.  And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds</span>
<a name="l16131"><span class="ln">16131 </span></a><span class="s0">her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never</span>
<a name="l16132"><span class="ln">16132 </span></a><span class="s0">sent it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16133"><span class="ln">16133 </span></a>
<a name="l16134"><span class="ln">16134 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I met William Larkins,&quot; continued Mr. Elton, &quot;as I got near</span>
<a name="l16135"><span class="ln">16135 </span></a><span class="s0">the house, and he told me I should not find his master at home,</span>
<a name="l16136"><span class="ln">16136 </span></a><span class="s0">but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour.</span>
<a name="l16137"><span class="ln">16137 </span></a><span class="s0">He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he</span>
<a name="l16138"><span class="ln">16138 </span></a><span class="s0">could hardly ever get the speech of him.  I have nothing to do with</span>
<a name="l16139"><span class="ln">16139 </span></a><span class="s0">William's wants, but it really is of very great importance that _I_</span>
<a name="l16140"><span class="ln">16140 </span></a><span class="s0">should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore,</span>
<a name="l16141"><span class="ln">16141 </span></a><span class="s0">of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk</span>
<a name="l16142"><span class="ln">16142 </span></a><span class="s0">to no purpose.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16143"><span class="ln">16143 </span></a>
<a name="l16144"><span class="ln">16144 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly.</span>
<a name="l16145"><span class="ln">16145 </span></a><span class="s0">In all probability she was at this very time waited for there;</span>
<a name="l16146"><span class="ln">16146 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression</span>
<a name="l16147"><span class="ln">16147 </span></a><span class="s0">towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.</span>
<a name="l16148"><span class="ln">16148 </span></a>
<a name="l16149"><span class="ln">16149 </span></a><span class="s0">She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined</span>
<a name="l16150"><span class="ln">16150 </span></a><span class="s0">to attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs;</span>
<a name="l16151"><span class="ln">16151 </span></a><span class="s0">it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of,</span>
<a name="l16152"><span class="ln">16152 </span></a><span class="s0">to say,</span>
<a name="l16153"><span class="ln">16153 </span></a>
<a name="l16154"><span class="ln">16154 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.</span>
<a name="l16155"><span class="ln">16155 </span></a><span class="s0">Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been</span>
<a name="l16156"><span class="ln">16156 </span></a><span class="s0">tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more</span>
<a name="l16157"><span class="ln">16157 </span></a><span class="s0">openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should</span>
<a name="l16158"><span class="ln">16158 </span></a><span class="s0">certainly have been impertinent.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16159"><span class="ln">16159 </span></a>
<a name="l16160"><span class="ln">16160 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought</span>
<a name="l16161"><span class="ln">16161 </span></a><span class="s0">infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her</span>
<a name="l16162"><span class="ln">16162 </span></a><span class="s0">usual composure--&quot;there would have been no danger.  The danger</span>
<a name="l16163"><span class="ln">16163 </span></a><span class="s0">would have been of my wearying you.  You could not have gratified</span>
<a name="l16164"><span class="ln">16164 </span></a><span class="s0">me more than by expressing an interest--.  Indeed, Miss Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l16165"><span class="ln">16165 </span></a><span class="s0">(speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which I</span>
<a name="l16166"><span class="ln">16166 </span></a><span class="s0">have of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly</span>
<a name="l16167"><span class="ln">16167 </span></a><span class="s0">consoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good</span>
<a name="l16168"><span class="ln">16168 </span></a><span class="s0">opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a</span>
<a name="l16169"><span class="ln">16169 </span></a><span class="s0">degree as to--I have not time for half that I could wish to say.</span>
<a name="l16170"><span class="ln">16170 </span></a><span class="s0">I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself.</span>
<a name="l16171"><span class="ln">16171 </span></a><span class="s0">I feel it so very due.  But, unfortunately--in short, if your</span>
<a name="l16172"><span class="ln">16172 </span></a><span class="s0">compassion does not stand my friend--&quot;</span>
<a name="l16173"><span class="ln">16173 </span></a>
<a name="l16174"><span class="ln">16174 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,&quot; cried Emma warmly,</span>
<a name="l16175"><span class="ln">16175 </span></a><span class="s0">and taking her hand.  &quot;You owe me no apologies; and every body to</span>
<a name="l16176"><span class="ln">16176 </span></a><span class="s0">whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied,</span>
<a name="l16177"><span class="ln">16177 </span></a><span class="s0">so delighted even--&quot;</span>
<a name="l16178"><span class="ln">16178 </span></a>
<a name="l16179"><span class="ln">16179 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--</span>
<a name="l16180"><span class="ln">16180 </span></a><span class="s0">So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life</span>
<a name="l16181"><span class="ln">16181 </span></a><span class="s0">of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16182"><span class="ln">16182 </span></a>
<a name="l16183"><span class="ln">16183 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Pray say no more.  I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.</span>
<a name="l16184"><span class="ln">16184 </span></a><span class="s0">Let us forgive each other at once.  We must do whatever is to be</span>
<a name="l16185"><span class="ln">16185 </span></a><span class="s0">done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there.</span>
<a name="l16186"><span class="ln">16186 </span></a><span class="s0">I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16187"><span class="ln">16187 </span></a>
<a name="l16188"><span class="ln">16188 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16189"><span class="ln">16189 </span></a>
<a name="l16190"><span class="ln">16190 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--</span>
<a name="l16191"><span class="ln">16191 </span></a><span class="s0">just as I begin to know you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16192"><span class="ln">16192 </span></a>
<a name="l16193"><span class="ln">16193 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet.</span>
<a name="l16194"><span class="ln">16194 </span></a><span class="s0">I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16195"><span class="ln">16195 </span></a>
<a name="l16196"><span class="ln">16196 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,&quot; replied Emma,</span>
<a name="l16197"><span class="ln">16197 </span></a><span class="s0">smiling--&quot;but, excuse me, it must be thought of.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16198"><span class="ln">16198 </span></a>
<a name="l16199"><span class="ln">16199 </span></a><span class="s0">The smile was returned as Jane answered,</span>

<a name="l16202"><span class="ln">16202 </span></a><span class="s0">to you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living</span>
<a name="l16203"><span class="ln">16203 </span></a><span class="s0">with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled.  There must be</span>
<a name="l16204"><span class="ln">16204 </span></a><span class="s0">three months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over,</span>
<a name="l16205"><span class="ln">16205 </span></a><span class="s0">I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for.&quot;</span>

<a name="l16207"><span class="ln">16207 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.--</span>
<a name="l16208"><span class="ln">16208 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!--</span>

<a name="l16214"><span class="ln">16214 </span></a>
<a name="l16215"><span class="ln">16215 </span></a>
<a name="l16216"><span class="ln">16216 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety;</span>
<a name="l16217"><span class="ln">16217 </span></a><span class="s0">and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased</span>
<a name="l16218"><span class="ln">16218 </span></a><span class="s0">to Emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl.</span>
<a name="l16219"><span class="ln">16219 </span></a><span class="s0">She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston.  She would</span>
<a name="l16220"><span class="ln">16220 </span></a><span class="s0">not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match</span>
<a name="l16221"><span class="ln">16221 </span></a><span class="s0">for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's sons; but she was</span>
<a name="l16222"><span class="ln">16222 </span></a><span class="s0">convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best.</span>
<a name="l16223"><span class="ln">16223 </span></a><span class="s0">It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older--</span>
<a name="l16224"><span class="ln">16224 </span></a><span class="s0">and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have</span>
<a name="l16225"><span class="ln">16225 </span></a><span class="s0">his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks</span>
<a name="l16226"><span class="ln">16226 </span></a><span class="s0">and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--</span>
<a name="l16227"><span class="ln">16227 </span></a><span class="s0">no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it</span>
<a name="l16228"><span class="ln">16228 </span></a><span class="s0">would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach,</span>
<a name="l16229"><span class="ln">16229 </span></a><span class="s0">should not have their powers in exercise again.</span>
<a name="l16230"><span class="ln">16230 </span></a>
<a name="l16231"><span class="ln">16231 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,&quot;</span>
<a name="l16232"><span class="ln">16232 </span></a><span class="s0">she continued--&quot;like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis,</span>
<a name="l16233"><span class="ln">16233 </span></a><span class="s0">in Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see</span>
<a name="l16234"><span class="ln">16234 </span></a><span class="s0">her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16235"><span class="ln">16235 </span></a>
<a name="l16236"><span class="ln">16236 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That is,&quot; replied Mr. Knightley, &quot;she will indulge her even more</span>
<a name="l16237"><span class="ln">16237 </span></a><span class="s0">than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all.</span>
<a name="l16238"><span class="ln">16238 </span></a><span class="s0">It will be the only difference.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16239"><span class="ln">16239 </span></a>
<a name="l16240"><span class="ln">16240 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Poor child!&quot; cried Emma; &quot;at that rate, what will become of her?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16241"><span class="ln">16241 </span></a>
<a name="l16242"><span class="ln">16242 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands.  She will be disagreeable</span>
<a name="l16243"><span class="ln">16243 </span></a><span class="s0">in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older.  I am losing</span>
<a name="l16244"><span class="ln">16244 </span></a><span class="s0">all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma.</span>
<a name="l16245"><span class="ln">16245 </span></a><span class="s0">I, who am owing all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible</span>
<a name="l16246"><span class="ln">16246 </span></a><span class="s0">ingratitude in me to be severe on them?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16247"><span class="ln">16247 </span></a>
<a name="l16248"><span class="ln">16248 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma laughed, and replied:  &quot;But I had the assistance of all</span>
<a name="l16249"><span class="ln">16249 </span></a><span class="s0">your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people.</span>
<a name="l16250"><span class="ln">16250 </span></a><span class="s0">I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16251"><span class="ln">16251 </span></a>
<a name="l16252"><span class="ln">16252 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Do you?--I have no doubt.  Nature gave you understanding:--</span>
<a name="l16253"><span class="ln">16253 </span></a><span class="s0">Miss Taylor gave you principles.  You must have done well.</span>
<a name="l16254"><span class="ln">16254 </span></a><span class="s0">My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good.  It was</span>
<a name="l16255"><span class="ln">16255 </span></a><span class="s0">very natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?--</span>
<a name="l16256"><span class="ln">16256 </span></a><span class="s0">and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done</span>
<a name="l16257"><span class="ln">16257 </span></a><span class="s0">in a disagreeable manner.  I do not believe I did you any good.</span>
<a name="l16258"><span class="ln">16258 </span></a><span class="s0">The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest</span>
<a name="l16259"><span class="ln">16259 </span></a><span class="s0">affection to me.  I could not think about you so much without doating</span>
<a name="l16260"><span class="ln">16260 </span></a><span class="s0">on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,</span>
<a name="l16261"><span class="ln">16261 </span></a><span class="s0">have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16262"><span class="ln">16262 </span></a>
<a name="l16263"><span class="ln">16263 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am sure you were of use to me,&quot; cried Emma.  &quot;I was very often</span>
<a name="l16264"><span class="ln">16264 </span></a><span class="s0">influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time.</span>
<a name="l16265"><span class="ln">16265 </span></a><span class="s0">I am very sure you did me good.  And if poor little Anna Weston is</span>
<a name="l16266"><span class="ln">16266 </span></a><span class="s0">to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much</span>
<a name="l16267"><span class="ln">16267 </span></a><span class="s0">for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her</span>
<a name="l16268"><span class="ln">16268 </span></a><span class="s0">when she is thirteen.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16269"><span class="ln">16269 </span></a>
<a name="l16270"><span class="ln">16270 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one</span>
<a name="l16271"><span class="ln">16271 </span></a><span class="s0">of your saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so;</span>
<a name="l16272"><span class="ln">16272 </span></a><span class="s0">papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which,</span>
<a name="l16273"><span class="ln">16273 </span></a><span class="s0">you knew, I did not approve.  In such cases my interference was giving</span>
<a name="l16274"><span class="ln">16274 </span></a><span class="s0">you two bad feelings instead of one.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16275"><span class="ln">16275 </span></a>
<a name="l16276"><span class="ln">16276 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold</span>
<a name="l16277"><span class="ln">16277 </span></a><span class="s0">my speeches in such affectionate remembrance.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16278"><span class="ln">16278 </span></a>
<a name="l16279"><span class="ln">16279 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;`Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and,</span>
<a name="l16280"><span class="ln">16280 </span></a><span class="s0">from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal.</span>
<a name="l16281"><span class="ln">16281 </span></a><span class="s0">I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16282"><span class="ln">16282 </span></a>
<a name="l16283"><span class="ln">16283 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable fits,</span>
<a name="l16284"><span class="ln">16284 </span></a><span class="s0">about ten years ago.  I did it because I thought it would offend you;</span>
<a name="l16285"><span class="ln">16285 </span></a><span class="s0">but, as you made no objection, I never did it again.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16286"><span class="ln">16286 </span></a>
<a name="l16287"><span class="ln">16287 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And cannot you call me `George' now?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16288"><span class="ln">16288 </span></a>
<a name="l16289"><span class="ln">16289 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.'</span>
<a name="l16290"><span class="ln">16290 </span></a><span class="s0">I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton,</span>
<a name="l16291"><span class="ln">16291 </span></a><span class="s0">by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,&quot; she added presently,</span>
<a name="l16292"><span class="ln">16292 </span></a><span class="s0">laughing and blushing--&quot;I will promise to call you once by your</span>
<a name="l16293"><span class="ln">16293 </span></a><span class="s0">Christian name.  I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess</span>
<a name="l16294"><span class="ln">16294 </span></a><span class="s0">where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16295"><span class="ln">16295 </span></a>
<a name="l16296"><span class="ln">16296 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one</span>
<a name="l16297"><span class="ln">16297 </span></a><span class="s0">important service which his better sense would have rendered her,</span>
<a name="l16298"><span class="ln">16298 </span></a><span class="s0">to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all</span>
<a name="l16299"><span class="ln">16299 </span></a><span class="s0">her womanly follies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith;</span>
<a name="l16300"><span class="ln">16300 </span></a><span class="s0">but it was too tender a subject.--She could not enter on it.--</span>
<a name="l16301"><span class="ln">16301 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them.  This, on his side,</span>
<a name="l16302"><span class="ln">16302 </span></a><span class="s0">might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma</span>
<a name="l16303"><span class="ln">16303 </span></a><span class="s0">was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion,</span>
<a name="l16304"><span class="ln">16304 </span></a><span class="s0">from some appearances, that their friendship were declining.</span>
<a name="l16305"><span class="ln">16305 </span></a><span class="s0">She was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances,</span>
<a name="l16306"><span class="ln">16306 </span></a><span class="s0">they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her</span>
<a name="l16307"><span class="ln">16307 </span></a><span class="s0">intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did,</span>
<a name="l16308"><span class="ln">16308 </span></a><span class="s0">on Isabella's letters.  He might observe that it was so.  The pain</span>
<a name="l16309"><span class="ln">16309 </span></a><span class="s0">of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little</span>
<a name="l16310"><span class="ln">16310 </span></a><span class="s0">inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.</span>
<a name="l16311"><span class="ln">16311 </span></a>
<a name="l16312"><span class="ln">16312 </span></a><span class="s0">Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could</span>
<a name="l16313"><span class="ln">16313 </span></a><span class="s0">be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,</span>
<a name="l16314"><span class="ln">16314 </span></a><span class="s0">which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to</span>
<a name="l16315"><span class="ln">16315 </span></a><span class="s0">be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not</span>
<a name="l16316"><span class="ln">16316 </span></a><span class="s0">appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.--</span>
<a name="l16317"><span class="ln">16317 </span></a><span class="s0">Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet</span>
<a name="l16318"><span class="ln">16318 </span></a><span class="s0">had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have</span>
<a name="l16319"><span class="ln">16319 </span></a><span class="s0">escaped her.  Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on,</span>
<a name="l16320"><span class="ln">16320 </span></a><span class="s0">by Harriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be</span>
<a name="l16321"><span class="ln">16321 </span></a><span class="s0">a month at least.  Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down</span>
<a name="l16322"><span class="ln">16322 </span></a><span class="s0">in August, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.</span>
<a name="l16323"><span class="ln">16323 </span></a>
<a name="l16324"><span class="ln">16324 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;John does not even mention your friend,&quot; said Mr. Knightley.</span>
<a name="l16325"><span class="ln">16325 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Here is his answer, if you like to see it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16326"><span class="ln">16326 </span></a>
<a name="l16327"><span class="ln">16327 </span></a><span class="s0">It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.</span>
<a name="l16328"><span class="ln">16328 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive</span>
<a name="l16329"><span class="ln">16329 </span></a><span class="s0">to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing</span>
<a name="l16330"><span class="ln">16330 </span></a><span class="s0">that her friend was unmentioned.</span>
<a name="l16331"><span class="ln">16331 </span></a>
<a name="l16332"><span class="ln">16332 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;John enters like a brother into my happiness,&quot; continued Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l16333"><span class="ln">16333 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,</span>
<a name="l16334"><span class="ln">16334 </span></a><span class="s0">likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from</span>
<a name="l16335"><span class="ln">16335 </span></a><span class="s0">making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather</span>
<a name="l16336"><span class="ln">16336 </span></a><span class="s0">cool in her praise.  But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16337"><span class="ln">16337 </span></a>
<a name="l16338"><span class="ln">16338 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He writes like a sensible man,&quot; replied Emma, when she had read</span>
<a name="l16339"><span class="ln">16339 </span></a><span class="s0">the letter.  &quot;I honour his sincerity.  It is very plain that he</span>
<a name="l16340"><span class="ln">16340 </span></a><span class="s0">considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side,</span>
<a name="l16341"><span class="ln">16341 </span></a><span class="s0">but that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy</span>
<a name="l16342"><span class="ln">16342 </span></a><span class="s0">of your affection, as you think me already.  Had he said any thing</span>
<a name="l16343"><span class="ln">16343 </span></a><span class="s0">to bear a different construction, I should not have believed him.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16344"><span class="ln">16344 </span></a>
<a name="l16345"><span class="ln">16345 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;My Emma, he means no such thing.  He only means--&quot;</span>
<a name="l16346"><span class="ln">16346 </span></a>
<a name="l16347"><span class="ln">16347 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,&quot;</span>
<a name="l16348"><span class="ln">16348 </span></a><span class="s0">interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--&quot;much less, perhaps,</span>
<a name="l16349"><span class="ln">16349 </span></a><span class="s0">than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve</span>
<a name="l16350"><span class="ln">16350 </span></a><span class="s0">on the subject.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16351"><span class="ln">16351 </span></a>
<a name="l16352"><span class="ln">16352 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Emma, my dear Emma--&quot;</span>
<a name="l16353"><span class="ln">16353 </span></a>
<a name="l16354"><span class="ln">16354 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried with more thorough gaiety, &quot;if you fancy your</span>
<a name="l16355"><span class="ln">16355 </span></a><span class="s0">brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in</span>
<a name="l16356"><span class="ln">16356 </span></a><span class="s0">the secret, and hear his opinion.  Depend upon it, he will be much</span>
<a name="l16357"><span class="ln">16357 </span></a><span class="s0">farther from doing _you_ justice.  He will think all the happiness,</span>
<a name="l16358"><span class="ln">16358 </span></a><span class="s0">all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit</span>
<a name="l16359"><span class="ln">16359 </span></a><span class="s0">on mine.  I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him at once.--</span>
<a name="l16360"><span class="ln">16360 </span></a><span class="s0">His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16361"><span class="ln">16361 </span></a>
<a name="l16362"><span class="ln">16362 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah!&quot; he cried, &quot;I wish your father might be half as easily convinced</span>
<a name="l16363"><span class="ln">16363 </span></a><span class="s0">as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,</span>
<a name="l16364"><span class="ln">16364 </span></a><span class="s0">to be happy together.  I am amused by one part of John's letter--</span>
<a name="l16365"><span class="ln">16365 </span></a><span class="s0">did you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take</span>
<a name="l16366"><span class="ln">16366 </span></a><span class="s0">him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing</span>
<a name="l16367"><span class="ln">16367 </span></a><span class="s0">something of the kind.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16368"><span class="ln">16368 </span></a>
<a name="l16369"><span class="ln">16369 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having</span>
<a name="l16370"><span class="ln">16370 </span></a><span class="s0">some thoughts of marrying.  He had no idea of me.  He seems perfectly</span>
<a name="l16371"><span class="ln">16371 </span></a><span class="s0">unprepared for that.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16372"><span class="ln">16372 </span></a>
<a name="l16373"><span class="ln">16373 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into</span>
<a name="l16374"><span class="ln">16374 </span></a><span class="s0">my feelings.  What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious</span>
<a name="l16375"><span class="ln">16375 </span></a><span class="s0">of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare</span>
<a name="l16376"><span class="ln">16376 </span></a><span class="s0">him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.--</span>
<a name="l16377"><span class="ln">16377 </span></a><span class="s0">But it was so, I suppose.  I dare say there was a difference when I</span>
<a name="l16378"><span class="ln">16378 </span></a><span class="s0">was staying with them the other day.  I believe I did not play</span>
<a name="l16379"><span class="ln">16379 </span></a><span class="s0">with the children quite so much as usual.  I remember one evening</span>
<a name="l16380"><span class="ln">16380 </span></a><span class="s0">the poor boys saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.'&quot;</span>
<a name="l16381"><span class="ln">16381 </span></a>
<a name="l16382"><span class="ln">16382 </span></a><span class="s0">The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons'</span>
<a name="l16383"><span class="ln">16383 </span></a><span class="s0">reception of it tried.  As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently</span>
<a name="l16384"><span class="ln">16384 </span></a><span class="s0">recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view</span>
<a name="l16385"><span class="ln">16385 </span></a><span class="s0">that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause,</span>
<a name="l16386"><span class="ln">16386 </span></a><span class="s0">resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--</span>
<a name="l16387"><span class="ln">16387 </span></a><span class="s0">But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself</span>
<a name="l16388"><span class="ln">16388 </span></a><span class="s0">to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it</span>
<a name="l16389"><span class="ln">16389 </span></a><span class="s0">came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must</span>
<a name="l16390"><span class="ln">16390 </span></a><span class="s0">have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time,</span>
<a name="l16391"><span class="ln">16391 </span></a><span class="s0">and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced</span>
<a name="l16392"><span class="ln">16392 </span></a><span class="s0">to speak, and to speak cheerfully too.  She must not make it a more</span>
<a name="l16393"><span class="ln">16393 </span></a><span class="s0">decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.</span>
<a name="l16394"><span class="ln">16394 </span></a><span class="s0">She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits</span>
<a name="l16395"><span class="ln">16395 </span></a><span class="s0">she could command, she prepared him first for something strange,</span>
<a name="l16396"><span class="ln">16396 </span></a><span class="s0">and then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation</span>
<a name="l16397"><span class="ln">16397 </span></a><span class="s0">could be obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with</span>
<a name="l16398"><span class="ln">16398 </span></a><span class="s0">no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--</span>
<a name="l16399"><span class="ln">16399 </span></a><span class="s0">she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield</span>
<a name="l16400"><span class="ln">16400 </span></a><span class="s0">would receive the constant addition of that person's company</span>
<a name="l16401"><span class="ln">16401 </span></a><span class="s0">whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,</span>
<a name="l16402"><span class="ln">16402 </span></a><span class="s0">best in the world.</span>
<a name="l16403"><span class="ln">16403 </span></a>
<a name="l16404"><span class="ln">16404 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried</span>
<a name="l16405"><span class="ln">16405 </span></a><span class="s0">earnestly to dissuade her from it.  She was reminded, more than once,</span>
<a name="l16406"><span class="ln">16406 </span></a><span class="s0">of having always said she would never marry, and assured that it</span>
<a name="l16407"><span class="ln">16407 </span></a><span class="s0">would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of</span>
<a name="l16408"><span class="ln">16408 </span></a><span class="s0">poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.  Emma hung</span>
<a name="l16409"><span class="ln">16409 </span></a><span class="s0">about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that</span>
<a name="l16410"><span class="ln">16410 </span></a><span class="s0">he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages</span>
<a name="l16411"><span class="ln">16411 </span></a><span class="s0">taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change:</span>
<a name="l16412"><span class="ln">16412 </span></a><span class="s0">but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there;</span>
<a name="l16413"><span class="ln">16413 </span></a><span class="s0">she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but</span>
<a name="l16414"><span class="ln">16414 </span></a><span class="s0">for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal</span>
<a name="l16415"><span class="ln">16415 </span></a><span class="s0">the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once</span>
<a name="l16416"><span class="ln">16416 </span></a><span class="s0">got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?--</span>
<a name="l16417"><span class="ln">16417 </span></a><span class="s0">He would not deny that he did, she was sure.--Whom did he ever want</span>
<a name="l16418"><span class="ln">16418 </span></a><span class="s0">to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him,</span>
<a name="l16419"><span class="ln">16419 </span></a><span class="s0">who so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?--</span>
<a name="l16420"><span class="ln">16420 </span></a><span class="s0">Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?--Would not he</span>
<a name="l16421"><span class="ln">16421 </span></a><span class="s0">like to have him always on the spot?--Yes.  That was all very true.</span>
<a name="l16422"><span class="ln">16422 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see</span>
<a name="l16423"><span class="ln">16423 </span></a><span class="s0">him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could</span>
<a name="l16424"><span class="ln">16424 </span></a><span class="s0">not they go on as they had done?</span>
<a name="l16425"><span class="ln">16425 </span></a>
<a name="l16426"><span class="ln">16426 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,</span>
<a name="l16427"><span class="ln">16427 </span></a><span class="s0">the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--</span>
<a name="l16428"><span class="ln">16428 </span></a><span class="s0">To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's,</span>
<a name="l16429"><span class="ln">16429 </span></a><span class="s0">whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome;</span>
<a name="l16430"><span class="ln">16430 </span></a><span class="s0">and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--</span>
<a name="l16431"><span class="ln">16431 </span></a><span class="s0">They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters</span>
<a name="l16432"><span class="ln">16432 </span></a><span class="s0">of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready,</span>
<a name="l16433"><span class="ln">16433 </span></a><span class="s0">on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most</span>
<a name="l16434"><span class="ln">16434 </span></a><span class="s0">serviceable light--first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one--</span>
<a name="l16435"><span class="ln">16435 </span></a><span class="s0">well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations</span>
<a name="l16436"><span class="ln">16436 </span></a><span class="s0">to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be;</span>
<a name="l16437"><span class="ln">16437 </span></a><span class="s0">and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that</span>
<a name="l16438"><span class="ln">16438 </span></a><span class="s0">it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself</span>
<a name="l16439"><span class="ln">16439 </span></a><span class="s0">which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other--</span>
<a name="l16440"><span class="ln">16440 </span></a><span class="s0">in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very bad</span>
<a name="l16441"><span class="ln">16441 </span></a><span class="s0">if the marriage did take place.</span>
<a name="l16442"><span class="ln">16442 </span></a>
<a name="l16443"><span class="ln">16443 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she</span>
<a name="l16444"><span class="ln">16444 </span></a><span class="s0">said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,</span>
<a name="l16445"><span class="ln">16445 </span></a><span class="s0">never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her;</span>
<a name="l16446"><span class="ln">16446 </span></a><span class="s0">but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had</span>
<a name="l16447"><span class="ln">16447 </span></a><span class="s0">no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard</span>
<a name="l16448"><span class="ln">16448 </span></a><span class="s0">for Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma;</span>
<a name="l16449"><span class="ln">16449 </span></a><span class="s0">and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable</span>
<a name="l16450"><span class="ln">16450 </span></a><span class="s0">a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance,</span>
<a name="l16451"><span class="ln">16451 </span></a><span class="s0">so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed</span>
<a name="l16452"><span class="ln">16452 </span></a><span class="s0">as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature,</span>
<a name="l16453"><span class="ln">16453 </span></a><span class="s0">and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having</span>
<a name="l16454"><span class="ln">16454 </span></a><span class="s0">thought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men</span>
<a name="l16455"><span class="ln">16455 </span></a><span class="s0">in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own</span>
<a name="l16456"><span class="ln">16456 </span></a><span class="s0">home for Hartfield!  And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear</span>
<a name="l16457"><span class="ln">16457 </span></a><span class="s0">with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--</span>
<a name="l16458"><span class="ln">16458 </span></a><span class="s0">The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always</span>
<a name="l16459"><span class="ln">16459 </span></a><span class="s0">felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank</span>
<a name="l16460"><span class="ln">16460 </span></a><span class="s0">and Emma.  How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had</span>
<a name="l16461"><span class="ln">16461 </span></a><span class="s0">been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than</span>
<a name="l16462"><span class="ln">16462 </span></a><span class="s0">by herself--but even he had never been able to finish the subject</span>
<a name="l16463"><span class="ln">16463 </span></a><span class="s0">better than by saying--&quot;Those matters will take care of themselves;</span>
<a name="l16464"><span class="ln">16464 </span></a><span class="s0">the young people will find a way.&quot;  But here there was nothing to be</span>
<a name="l16465"><span class="ln">16465 </span></a><span class="s0">shifted off in a wild speculation on the future.  It was all right,</span>
<a name="l16466"><span class="ln">16466 </span></a><span class="s0">all open, all equal.  No sacrifice on any side worth the name.</span>
<a name="l16467"><span class="ln">16467 </span></a><span class="s0">It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself,</span>
<a name="l16468"><span class="ln">16468 </span></a><span class="s0">and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.</span>
<a name="l16469"><span class="ln">16469 </span></a>
<a name="l16470"><span class="ln">16470 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections</span>
<a name="l16471"><span class="ln">16471 </span></a><span class="s0">as these, was one of the happiest women in the world.  If any thing</span>
<a name="l16472"><span class="ln">16472 </span></a><span class="s0">could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would</span>
<a name="l16473"><span class="ln">16473 </span></a><span class="s0">soon have outgrown its first set of caps.</span>
<a name="l16474"><span class="ln">16474 </span></a>
<a name="l16475"><span class="ln">16475 </span></a><span class="s0">The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread;</span>
<a name="l16476"><span class="ln">16476 </span></a><span class="s0">and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes</span>
<a name="l16477"><span class="ln">16477 </span></a><span class="s0">were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--</span>
<a name="l16478"><span class="ln">16478 </span></a><span class="s0">He saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all</span>
<a name="l16479"><span class="ln">16479 </span></a><span class="s0">the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing;</span>
<a name="l16480"><span class="ln">16480 </span></a><span class="s0">and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he</span>
<a name="l16481"><span class="ln">16481 </span></a><span class="s0">had always foreseen it.</span>
<a name="l16482"><span class="ln">16482 </span></a>
<a name="l16483"><span class="ln">16483 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is to be a secret, I conclude,&quot; said he.  &quot;These matters are</span>
<a name="l16484"><span class="ln">16484 </span></a><span class="s0">always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them.</span>
<a name="l16485"><span class="ln">16485 </span></a><span class="s0">Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has</span>
<a name="l16486"><span class="ln">16486 </span></a><span class="s0">any suspicion.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16487"><span class="ln">16487 </span></a>
<a name="l16488"><span class="ln">16488 </span></a><span class="s0">He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on</span>
<a name="l16489"><span class="ln">16489 </span></a><span class="s0">that point.  He told her the news.  Was not she like a daughter,</span>
<a name="l16490"><span class="ln">16490 </span></a><span class="s0">his eldest daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present,</span>
<a name="l16491"><span class="ln">16491 </span></a><span class="s0">it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton,</span>
<a name="l16492"><span class="ln">16492 </span></a><span class="s0">immediately afterwards.  It was no more than the principals were</span>
<a name="l16493"><span class="ln">16493 </span></a><span class="s0">prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known</span>
<a name="l16494"><span class="ln">16494 </span></a><span class="s0">at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking</span>
<a name="l16495"><span class="ln">16495 </span></a><span class="s0">of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle,</span>
<a name="l16496"><span class="ln">16496 </span></a><span class="s0">with great sagacity.</span>
<a name="l16497"><span class="ln">16497 </span></a>
<a name="l16498"><span class="ln">16498 </span></a><span class="s0">In general, it was a very well approved match.  Some might think him,</span>
<a name="l16499"><span class="ln">16499 </span></a><span class="s0">and others might think her, the most in luck.  One set might</span>
<a name="l16500"><span class="ln">16500 </span></a><span class="s0">recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield</span>
<a name="l16501"><span class="ln">16501 </span></a><span class="s0">for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements</span>
<a name="l16502"><span class="ln">16502 </span></a><span class="s0">among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious</span>
<a name="l16503"><span class="ln">16503 </span></a><span class="s0">objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There,</span>
<a name="l16504"><span class="ln">16504 </span></a><span class="s0">the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.  Mr. Elton</span>
<a name="l16505"><span class="ln">16505 </span></a><span class="s0">cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped &quot;the</span>
<a name="l16506"><span class="ln">16506 </span></a><span class="s0">young lady's pride would now be contented;&quot; and supposed &quot;she had</span>
<a name="l16507"><span class="ln">16507 </span></a><span class="s0">always meant to catch Knightley if she could;&quot; and, on the point</span>
<a name="l16508"><span class="ln">16508 </span></a><span class="s0">of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, &quot;Rather he than I!&quot;--</span>
<a name="l16509"><span class="ln">16509 </span></a><span class="s0">But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--&quot;Poor Knightley!</span>
<a name="l16510"><span class="ln">16510 </span></a><span class="s0">poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned;</span>
<a name="l16511"><span class="ln">16511 </span></a><span class="s0">for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.--</span>
<a name="l16512"><span class="ln">16512 </span></a><span class="s0">How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love--</span>
<a name="l16513"><span class="ln">16513 </span></a><span class="s0">not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all</span>
<a name="l16514"><span class="ln">16514 </span></a><span class="s0">pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine</span>
<a name="l16515"><span class="ln">16515 </span></a><span class="s0">with them whenever they asked him!  But that would be all over now.--</span>
<a name="l16516"><span class="ln">16516 </span></a><span class="s0">Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_.</span>
<a name="l16517"><span class="ln">16517 </span></a><span class="s0">Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on</span>
<a name="l16518"><span class="ln">16518 </span></a><span class="s0">every thing.--Extremely disagreeable!  But she was not at all sorry</span>
<a name="l16519"><span class="ln">16519 </span></a><span class="s0">that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan,</span>
<a name="l16520"><span class="ln">16520 </span></a><span class="s0">living together.  It would never do.  She knew a family near Maple</span>
<a name="l16521"><span class="ln">16521 </span></a><span class="s0">Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end</span>
<a name="l16522"><span class="ln">16522 </span></a><span class="s0">of the first quarter.</span>

<a name="l16528"><span class="ln">16528 </span></a>
<a name="l16529"><span class="ln">16529 </span></a><span class="s0">Time passed on.  A few more to-morrows, and the party from London</span>
<a name="l16530"><span class="ln">16530 </span></a><span class="s0">would be arriving.  It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking</span>
<a name="l16531"><span class="ln">16531 </span></a><span class="s0">of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and</span>
<a name="l16532"><span class="ln">16532 </span></a><span class="s0">grieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts</span>
<a name="l16533"><span class="ln">16533 </span></a><span class="s0">were put by.  After the first chat of pleasure he was silent;</span>
<a name="l16534"><span class="ln">16534 </span></a><span class="s0">and then, in a graver tone, began with,</span>

<a name="l16538"><span class="ln">16538 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Good or bad?&quot; said she, quickly, looking up in his face.</span>
<a name="l16539"><span class="ln">16539 </span></a>
<a name="l16540"><span class="ln">16540 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do not know which it ought to be called.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16541"><span class="ln">16541 </span></a>
<a name="l16542"><span class="ln">16542 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance.  You are trying</span>
<a name="l16543"><span class="ln">16543 </span></a><span class="s0">not to smile.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16544"><span class="ln">16544 </span></a>
<a name="l16545"><span class="ln">16545 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am afraid,&quot; said he, composing his features, &quot;I am very much afraid,</span>
<a name="l16546"><span class="ln">16546 </span></a><span class="s0">my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16547"><span class="ln">16547 </span></a>
<a name="l16548"><span class="ln">16548 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which</span>
<a name="l16549"><span class="ln">16549 </span></a><span class="s0">pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16550"><span class="ln">16550 </span></a>
<a name="l16551"><span class="ln">16551 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;There is one subject,&quot; he replied, &quot;I hope but one, on which</span>
<a name="l16552"><span class="ln">16552 </span></a><span class="s0">we do not think alike.&quot;  He paused a moment, again smiling,</span>
<a name="l16553"><span class="ln">16553 </span></a><span class="s0">with his eyes fixed on her face.  &quot;Does nothing occur to you?--</span>
<a name="l16554"><span class="ln">16554 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16555"><span class="ln">16555 </span></a>
<a name="l16556"><span class="ln">16556 </span></a><span class="s0">Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,</span>
<a name="l16557"><span class="ln">16557 </span></a><span class="s0">though she knew not what.</span>
<a name="l16558"><span class="ln">16558 </span></a>
<a name="l16559"><span class="ln">16559 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Have you heard from her yourself this morning?&quot; cried he.</span>
<a name="l16560"><span class="ln">16560 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You have, I believe, and know the whole.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16561"><span class="ln">16561 </span></a>
<a name="l16562"><span class="ln">16562 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16563"><span class="ln">16563 </span></a>
<a name="l16564"><span class="ln">16564 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is.</span>
<a name="l16565"><span class="ln">16565 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16566"><span class="ln">16566 </span></a>
<a name="l16567"><span class="ln">16567 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--</span>
<a name="l16568"><span class="ln">16568 </span></a><span class="s0">and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, &quot;No, this is impossible!&quot;</span>
<a name="l16569"><span class="ln">16569 </span></a><span class="s0">but her lips were closed.</span>
<a name="l16570"><span class="ln">16570 </span></a>
<a name="l16571"><span class="ln">16571 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is so, indeed,&quot; continued Mr. Knightley; &quot;I have it from Robert</span>
<a name="l16572"><span class="ln">16572 </span></a><span class="s0">Martin himself.  He left me not half an hour ago.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16573"><span class="ln">16573 </span></a>
<a name="l16574"><span class="ln">16574 </span></a><span class="s0">She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.</span>
<a name="l16575"><span class="ln">16575 </span></a>
<a name="l16576"><span class="ln">16576 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were</span>
<a name="l16577"><span class="ln">16577 </span></a><span class="s0">the same.  But in time they will.  Time, you may be sure, will make</span>
<a name="l16578"><span class="ln">16578 </span></a><span class="s0">one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile,</span>
<a name="l16579"><span class="ln">16579 </span></a><span class="s0">we need not talk much on the subject.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16580"><span class="ln">16580 </span></a>
<a name="l16581"><span class="ln">16581 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You mistake me, you quite mistake me,&quot; she replied, exerting herself.</span>
<a name="l16582"><span class="ln">16582 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,</span>
<a name="l16583"><span class="ln">16583 </span></a><span class="s0">but I cannot believe it.  It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean</span>
<a name="l16584"><span class="ln">16584 </span></a><span class="s0">to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.  You cannot</span>
<a name="l16585"><span class="ln">16585 </span></a><span class="s0">mean that he has even proposed to her again--yet.  You only mean,</span>
<a name="l16586"><span class="ln">16586 </span></a><span class="s0">that he intends it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16587"><span class="ln">16587 </span></a>
<a name="l16588"><span class="ln">16588 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I mean that he has done it,&quot; answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling</span>
<a name="l16589"><span class="ln">16589 </span></a><span class="s0">but determined decision, &quot;and been accepted.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16590"><span class="ln">16590 </span></a>
<a name="l16591"><span class="ln">16591 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Good God!&quot; she cried.--&quot;Well!&quot;--Then having recourse to her workbasket,</span>
<a name="l16592"><span class="ln">16592 </span></a><span class="s0">in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the</span>
<a name="l16593"><span class="ln">16593 </span></a><span class="s0">exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she</span>
<a name="l16594"><span class="ln">16594 </span></a><span class="s0">must be expressing, she added, &quot;Well, now tell me every thing;</span>
<a name="l16595"><span class="ln">16595 </span></a><span class="s0">make this intelligible to me.  How, where, when?--Let me know it all.</span>
<a name="l16596"><span class="ln">16596 </span></a><span class="s0">I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy,</span>
<a name="l16597"><span class="ln">16597 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you.--How--how has it been possible?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16598"><span class="ln">16598 </span></a>
<a name="l16599"><span class="ln">16599 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is a very simple story.  He went to town on business three days ago,</span>
<a name="l16600"><span class="ln">16600 </span></a><span class="s0">and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting</span>
<a name="l16601"><span class="ln">16601 </span></a><span class="s0">to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers,</span>
<a name="l16602"><span class="ln">16602 </span></a><span class="s0">and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's.</span>
<a name="l16603"><span class="ln">16603 </span></a><span class="s0">They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party</span>
<a name="l16604"><span class="ln">16604 </span></a><span class="s0">was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith.</span>
<a name="l16605"><span class="ln">16605 </span></a><span class="s0">My friend Robert could not resist.  They called for him in their way;</span>
<a name="l16606"><span class="ln">16606 </span></a><span class="s0">were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with</span>
<a name="l16607"><span class="ln">16607 </span></a><span class="s0">them the next day--which he did--and in the course of that visit</span>
<a name="l16608"><span class="ln">16608 </span></a><span class="s0">(as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet;</span>
<a name="l16609"><span class="ln">16609 </span></a><span class="s0">and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance,</span>
<a name="l16610"><span class="ln">16610 </span></a><span class="s0">as happy even as he is deserving.  He came down by yesterday's coach,</span>
<a name="l16611"><span class="ln">16611 </span></a><span class="s0">and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report</span>
<a name="l16612"><span class="ln">16612 </span></a><span class="s0">his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own.</span>
<a name="l16613"><span class="ln">16613 </span></a><span class="s0">This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when.</span>
<a name="l16614"><span class="ln">16614 </span></a><span class="s0">Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.--</span>
<a name="l16615"><span class="ln">16615 </span></a><span class="s0">She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's</span>
<a name="l16616"><span class="ln">16616 </span></a><span class="s0">language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only</span>
<a name="l16617"><span class="ln">16617 </span></a><span class="s0">in the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed</span>
<a name="l16618"><span class="ln">16618 </span></a><span class="s0">for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did mention,</span>
<a name="l16619"><span class="ln">16619 </span></a><span class="s0">without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their</span>
<a name="l16620"><span class="ln">16620 </span></a><span class="s0">box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley</span>
<a name="l16621"><span class="ln">16621 </span></a><span class="s0">and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;</span>
<a name="l16622"><span class="ln">16622 </span></a><span class="s0">and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith</span>
<a name="l16623"><span class="ln">16623 </span></a><span class="s0">rather uneasy.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16624"><span class="ln">16624 </span></a>
<a name="l16625"><span class="ln">16625 </span></a><span class="s0">He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.  To speak,</span>
<a name="l16626"><span class="ln">16626 </span></a><span class="s0">she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree</span>
<a name="l16627"><span class="ln">16627 </span></a><span class="s0">of happiness.  She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.</span>
<a name="l16628"><span class="ln">16628 </span></a><span class="s0">Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while,</span>
<a name="l16629"><span class="ln">16629 </span></a><span class="s0">he added,</span>
<a name="l16630"><span class="ln">16630 </span></a>
<a name="l16631"><span class="ln">16631 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make</span>
<a name="l16632"><span class="ln">16632 </span></a><span class="s0">you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.</span>
<a name="l16633"><span class="ln">16633 </span></a><span class="s0">His situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies</span>
<a name="l16634"><span class="ln">16634 </span></a><span class="s0">your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better</span>
<a name="l16635"><span class="ln">16635 </span></a><span class="s0">of him as you know him more.  His good sense and good principles would</span>
<a name="l16636"><span class="ln">16636 </span></a><span class="s0">delight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your</span>
<a name="l16637"><span class="ln">16637 </span></a><span class="s0">friend in better hands.  His rank in society I would alter if I could,</span>
<a name="l16638"><span class="ln">16638 </span></a><span class="s0">which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me</span>
<a name="l16639"><span class="ln">16639 </span></a><span class="s0">about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16640"><span class="ln">16640 </span></a>
<a name="l16641"><span class="ln">16641 </span></a><span class="s0">He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself</span>
<a name="l16642"><span class="ln">16642 </span></a><span class="s0">not to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,</span>
<a name="l16643"><span class="ln">16643 </span></a>
<a name="l16644"><span class="ln">16644 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.  I think</span>
<a name="l16645"><span class="ln">16645 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet is doing extremely well.  _Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_.</span>
<a name="l16646"><span class="ln">16646 </span></a><span class="s0">In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are.</span>
<a name="l16647"><span class="ln">16647 </span></a><span class="s0">I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize.</span>
<a name="l16648"><span class="ln">16648 </span></a><span class="s0">You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly</span>
<a name="l16649"><span class="ln">16649 </span></a><span class="s0">unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more</span>
<a name="l16650"><span class="ln">16650 </span></a><span class="s0">determined against him, much more, than she was before.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16651"><span class="ln">16651 </span></a>
<a name="l16652"><span class="ln">16652 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You ought to know your friend best,&quot; replied Mr. Knightley;</span>
<a name="l16653"><span class="ln">16653 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl,</span>
<a name="l16654"><span class="ln">16654 </span></a><span class="s0">not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told</span>
<a name="l16655"><span class="ln">16655 </span></a><span class="s0">her he loved her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16656"><span class="ln">16656 </span></a>
<a name="l16657"><span class="ln">16657 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma could not help laughing as she answered, &quot;Upon my word,</span>
<a name="l16658"><span class="ln">16658 </span></a><span class="s0">I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l16659"><span class="ln">16659 </span></a><span class="s0">are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright</span>
<a name="l16660"><span class="ln">16660 </span></a><span class="s0">_accepted_ him.  I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--</span>
<a name="l16661"><span class="ln">16661 </span></a><span class="s0">Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things;</span>
<a name="l16662"><span class="ln">16662 </span></a><span class="s0">of business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you,</span>
<a name="l16663"><span class="ln">16663 </span></a><span class="s0">in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not</span>
<a name="l16664"><span class="ln">16664 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's hand that he was certain of--it was the dimensions of some</span>
<a name="l16665"><span class="ln">16665 </span></a><span class="s0">famous ox.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16666"><span class="ln">16666 </span></a>
<a name="l16667"><span class="ln">16667 </span></a><span class="s0">The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and</span>
<a name="l16668"><span class="ln">16668 </span></a><span class="s0">Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings,</span>
<a name="l16669"><span class="ln">16669 </span></a><span class="s0">and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently</span>
<a name="l16670"><span class="ln">16670 </span></a><span class="s0">passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words,</span>
<a name="l16671"><span class="ln">16671 </span></a><span class="s0">spoken with such emphasis, &quot;No, I hope I know better than to think</span>
<a name="l16672"><span class="ln">16672 </span></a><span class="s0">of Robert Martin,&quot; that she was really expecting the intelligence</span>
<a name="l16673"><span class="ln">16673 </span></a><span class="s0">to prove, in some measure, premature.  It could not be otherwise.</span>
<a name="l16674"><span class="ln">16674 </span></a>
<a name="l16675"><span class="ln">16675 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Do you dare say this?&quot; cried Mr. Knightley.  &quot;Do you dare to suppose</span>
<a name="l16676"><span class="ln">16676 </span></a><span class="s0">me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--</span>
<a name="l16677"><span class="ln">16677 </span></a><span class="s0">What do you deserve?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16678"><span class="ln">16678 </span></a>
<a name="l16679"><span class="ln">16679 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh!  I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put</span>
<a name="l16680"><span class="ln">16680 </span></a><span class="s0">up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain,</span>
<a name="l16681"><span class="ln">16681 </span></a><span class="s0">direct answer.  Are you quite sure that you understand the terms</span>
<a name="l16682"><span class="ln">16682 </span></a><span class="s0">on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16683"><span class="ln">16683 </span></a>
<a name="l16684"><span class="ln">16684 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am quite sure,&quot; he replied, speaking very distinctly, &quot;that he</span>
<a name="l16685"><span class="ln">16685 </span></a><span class="s0">told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,</span>
<a name="l16686"><span class="ln">16686 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you</span>
<a name="l16687"><span class="ln">16687 </span></a><span class="s0">a proof that it must be so.  He asked my opinion as to what he</span>
<a name="l16688"><span class="ln">16688 </span></a><span class="s0">was now to do.  He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he</span>
<a name="l16689"><span class="ln">16689 </span></a><span class="s0">could apply for information of her relations or friends.  Could I</span>
<a name="l16690"><span class="ln">16690 </span></a><span class="s0">mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard?</span>
<a name="l16691"><span class="ln">16691 </span></a><span class="s0">I assured him that I could not.  Then, he said, he would endeavour</span>
<a name="l16692"><span class="ln">16692 </span></a><span class="s0">to see her in the course of this day.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16693"><span class="ln">16693 </span></a>
<a name="l16694"><span class="ln">16694 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I am perfectly satisfied,&quot; replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,</span>
<a name="l16695"><span class="ln">16695 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;and most sincerely wish them happy.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16696"><span class="ln">16696 </span></a>
<a name="l16697"><span class="ln">16697 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16698"><span class="ln">16698 </span></a>
<a name="l16699"><span class="ln">16699 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16700"><span class="ln">16700 </span></a>
<a name="l16701"><span class="ln">16701 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all</span>
<a name="l16702"><span class="ln">16702 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet's good qualities.  I have taken some pains for your sake,</span>
<a name="l16703"><span class="ln">16703 </span></a><span class="s0">and for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe</span>
<a name="l16704"><span class="ln">16704 </span></a><span class="s0">as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.</span>
<a name="l16705"><span class="ln">16705 </span></a><span class="s0">I have often talked to her a good deal.  You must have seen that</span>
<a name="l16706"><span class="ln">16706 </span></a><span class="s0">I did.  Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me</span>
<a name="l16707"><span class="ln">16707 </span></a><span class="s0">of pleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all</span>
<a name="l16708"><span class="ln">16708 </span></a><span class="s0">my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,</span>
<a name="l16709"><span class="ln">16709 </span></a><span class="s0">with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing</span>
<a name="l16710"><span class="ln">16710 </span></a><span class="s0">her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.--</span>
<a name="l16711"><span class="ln">16711 </span></a><span class="s0">Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16712"><span class="ln">16712 </span></a>
<a name="l16713"><span class="ln">16713 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Me!&quot; cried Emma, shaking her head.--&quot;Ah! poor Harriet!&quot;</span>
<a name="l16714"><span class="ln">16714 </span></a>
<a name="l16715"><span class="ln">16715 </span></a><span class="s0">She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little</span>
<a name="l16716"><span class="ln">16716 </span></a><span class="s0">more praise than she deserved.</span>
<a name="l16717"><span class="ln">16717 </span></a>
<a name="l16718"><span class="ln">16718 </span></a><span class="s0">Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of</span>
<a name="l16719"><span class="ln">16719 </span></a><span class="s0">her father.  She was not sorry.  She wanted to be alone.  Her mind</span>
<a name="l16720"><span class="ln">16720 </span></a><span class="s0">was in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her</span>
<a name="l16721"><span class="ln">16721 </span></a><span class="s0">to be collected.  She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits;</span>
<a name="l16722"><span class="ln">16722 </span></a><span class="s0">and till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed</span>
<a name="l16723"><span class="ln">16723 </span></a><span class="s0">and reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.</span>
<a name="l16724"><span class="ln">16724 </span></a>
<a name="l16725"><span class="ln">16725 </span></a><span class="s0">Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put</span>
<a name="l16726"><span class="ln">16726 </span></a><span class="s0">the horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls;</span>
<a name="l16727"><span class="ln">16727 </span></a><span class="s0">and she had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.</span>
<a name="l16728"><span class="ln">16728 </span></a>
<a name="l16729"><span class="ln">16729 </span></a><span class="s0">The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations</span>
<a name="l16730"><span class="ln">16730 </span></a><span class="s0">may be imagined.  The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the</span>
<a name="l16731"><span class="ln">16731 </span></a><span class="s0">prospect of Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming</span>
<a name="l16732"><span class="ln">16732 </span></a><span class="s0">too happy for security.--What had she to wish for?  Nothing, but to</span>
<a name="l16733"><span class="ln">16733 </span></a><span class="s0">grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been</span>
<a name="l16734"><span class="ln">16734 </span></a><span class="s0">ever so superior to her own.  Nothing, but that the lessons</span>
<a name="l16735"><span class="ln">16735 </span></a><span class="s0">of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.</span>
<a name="l16736"><span class="ln">16736 </span></a>
<a name="l16737"><span class="ln">16737 </span></a><span class="s0">Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;</span>
<a name="l16738"><span class="ln">16738 </span></a><span class="s0">and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst</span>
<a name="l16739"><span class="ln">16739 </span></a><span class="s0">of them.  She must laugh at such a close!  Such an end of the doleful</span>
<a name="l16740"><span class="ln">16740 </span></a><span class="s0">disappointment of five weeks back!  Such a heart--such a Harriet!</span>
<a name="l16741"><span class="ln">16741 </span></a>
<a name="l16742"><span class="ln">16742 </span></a><span class="s0">Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would</span>
<a name="l16743"><span class="ln">16743 </span></a><span class="s0">be a pleasure.  It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.</span>
<a name="l16744"><span class="ln">16744 </span></a>
<a name="l16745"><span class="ln">16745 </span></a><span class="s0">High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,</span>
<a name="l16746"><span class="ln">16746 </span></a><span class="s0">was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from</span>
<a name="l16747"><span class="ln">16747 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley would soon be over.  The disguise, equivocation,</span>
<a name="l16748"><span class="ln">16748 </span></a><span class="s0">mystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over.</span>
<a name="l16749"><span class="ln">16749 </span></a><span class="s0">She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect</span>
<a name="l16750"><span class="ln">16750 </span></a><span class="s0">confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.</span>
<a name="l16751"><span class="ln">16751 </span></a>
<a name="l16752"><span class="ln">16752 </span></a><span class="s0">In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;</span>
<a name="l16753"><span class="ln">16753 </span></a><span class="s0">not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;</span>
<a name="l16754"><span class="ln">16754 </span></a><span class="s0">and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable</span>
<a name="l16755"><span class="ln">16755 </span></a><span class="s0">persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,</span>
<a name="l16756"><span class="ln">16756 </span></a><span class="s0">or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.</span>
<a name="l16757"><span class="ln">16757 </span></a>
<a name="l16758"><span class="ln">16758 </span></a><span class="s0">They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--</span>
<a name="l16759"><span class="ln">16759 </span></a><span class="s0">but hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l16760"><span class="ln">16760 </span></a><span class="s0">received the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse</span>
<a name="l16761"><span class="ln">16761 </span></a><span class="s0">was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.</span>
<a name="l16762"><span class="ln">16762 </span></a>
<a name="l16763"><span class="ln">16763 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,&quot; said Mrs. Weston.  &quot;I was just</span>
<a name="l16764"><span class="ln">16764 </span></a><span class="s0">going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive</span>
<a name="l16765"><span class="ln">16765 </span></a><span class="s0">this morning.  He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been</span>
<a name="l16766"><span class="ln">16766 </span></a><span class="s0">persuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16767"><span class="ln">16767 </span></a>
<a name="l16768"><span class="ln">16768 </span></a><span class="s0">In half a minute they were in the room.  Emma was extremely glad</span>
<a name="l16769"><span class="ln">16769 </span></a><span class="s0">to see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of</span>
<a name="l16770"><span class="ln">16770 </span></a><span class="s0">embarrassing recollections on each side.  They met readily and smiling,</span>
<a name="l16771"><span class="ln">16771 </span></a><span class="s0">but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;</span>
<a name="l16772"><span class="ln">16772 </span></a><span class="s0">and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank</span>
<a name="l16773"><span class="ln">16773 </span></a><span class="s0">in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,</span>
<a name="l16774"><span class="ln">16774 </span></a><span class="s0">which she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more,</span>
<a name="l16775"><span class="ln">16775 </span></a><span class="s0">and of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.</span>
<a name="l16776"><span class="ln">16776 </span></a><span class="s0">When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby</span>
<a name="l16777"><span class="ln">16777 </span></a><span class="s0">was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--</span>
<a name="l16778"><span class="ln">16778 </span></a><span class="s0">or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her</span>
<a name="l16779"><span class="ln">16779 </span></a><span class="s0">and say,</span>
<a name="l16780"><span class="ln">16780 </span></a>
<a name="l16781"><span class="ln">16781 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving</span>
<a name="l16782"><span class="ln">16782 </span></a><span class="s0">message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters.  I hope time has not made</span>
<a name="l16783"><span class="ln">16783 </span></a><span class="s0">you less willing to pardon.  I hope you do not retract what you</span>
<a name="l16784"><span class="ln">16784 </span></a><span class="s0">then said.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16785"><span class="ln">16785 </span></a>
<a name="l16786"><span class="ln">16786 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;No, indeed,&quot; cried Emma, most happy to begin, &quot;not in the least.</span>
<a name="l16787"><span class="ln">16787 </span></a><span class="s0">I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give</span>
<a name="l16788"><span class="ln">16788 </span></a><span class="s0">you joy in person.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16789"><span class="ln">16789 </span></a>
<a name="l16790"><span class="ln">16790 </span></a><span class="s0">He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak</span>
<a name="l16791"><span class="ln">16791 </span></a><span class="s0">with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.</span>
<a name="l16792"><span class="ln">16792 </span></a>
<a name="l16793"><span class="ln">16793 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Is not she looking well?&quot; said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.</span>
<a name="l16794"><span class="ln">16794 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and</span>
<a name="l16795"><span class="ln">16795 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston doat upon her.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16796"><span class="ln">16796 </span></a>
<a name="l16797"><span class="ln">16797 </span></a><span class="s0">But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,</span>
<a name="l16798"><span class="ln">16798 </span></a><span class="s0">after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named</span>
<a name="l16799"><span class="ln">16799 </span></a><span class="s0">the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced</span>
<a name="l16800"><span class="ln">16800 </span></a><span class="s0">in her hearing.</span>
<a name="l16801"><span class="ln">16801 </span></a>
<a name="l16802"><span class="ln">16802 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I can never think of it,&quot; she cried, &quot;without extreme shame.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16803"><span class="ln">16803 </span></a>
<a name="l16804"><span class="ln">16804 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;The shame,&quot; he answered, &quot;is all mine, or ought to be.  But is it</span>
<a name="l16805"><span class="ln">16805 </span></a><span class="s0">possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.  Early, I know,</span>
<a name="l16806"><span class="ln">16806 </span></a><span class="s0">you had none.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16807"><span class="ln">16807 </span></a>
<a name="l16808"><span class="ln">16808 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I never had the smallest, I assure you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16809"><span class="ln">16809 </span></a>
<a name="l16810"><span class="ln">16810 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;That appears quite wonderful.  I was once very near--and I wish I had--</span>
<a name="l16811"><span class="ln">16811 </span></a><span class="s0">it would have been better.  But though I was always doing wrong things,</span>
<a name="l16812"><span class="ln">16812 </span></a><span class="s0">they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--</span>
<a name="l16813"><span class="ln">16813 </span></a><span class="s0">It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond</span>
<a name="l16814"><span class="ln">16814 </span></a><span class="s0">of secrecy and told you every thing.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16815"><span class="ln">16815 </span></a>
<a name="l16816"><span class="ln">16816 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;It is not now worth a regret,&quot; said Emma.</span>
<a name="l16817"><span class="ln">16817 </span></a>
<a name="l16818"><span class="ln">16818 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have some hope,&quot; resumed he, &quot;of my uncle's being persuaded</span>
<a name="l16819"><span class="ln">16819 </span></a><span class="s0">to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her.</span>
<a name="l16820"><span class="ln">16820 </span></a><span class="s0">When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London,</span>
<a name="l16821"><span class="ln">16821 </span></a><span class="s0">and continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now,</span>
<a name="l16822"><span class="ln">16822 </span></a><span class="s0">I am at such a distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--</span>
<a name="l16823"><span class="ln">16823 </span></a><span class="s0">Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation.</span>
<a name="l16824"><span class="ln">16824 </span></a><span class="s0">Do not you pity me?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16825"><span class="ln">16825 </span></a>
<a name="l16826"><span class="ln">16826 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession</span>
<a name="l16827"><span class="ln">16827 </span></a><span class="s0">of gay thought, he cried,</span>
<a name="l16828"><span class="ln">16828 </span></a>
<a name="l16829"><span class="ln">16829 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Ah! by the bye,&quot; then sinking his voice, and looking demure for</span>
<a name="l16830"><span class="ln">16830 </span></a><span class="s0">the moment--&quot;I hope Mr. Knightley is well?&quot;  He paused.--She coloured</span>
<a name="l16831"><span class="ln">16831 </span></a><span class="s0">and laughed.--&quot;I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember</span>
<a name="l16832"><span class="ln">16832 </span></a><span class="s0">my wish in your favour.  Let me return your congratulations.--</span>
<a name="l16833"><span class="ln">16833 </span></a><span class="s0">I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest</span>
<a name="l16834"><span class="ln">16834 </span></a><span class="s0">and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16835"><span class="ln">16835 </span></a>
<a name="l16836"><span class="ln">16836 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;</span>
<a name="l16837"><span class="ln">16837 </span></a><span class="s0">but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his</span>
<a name="l16838"><span class="ln">16838 </span></a><span class="s0">own Jane, and his next words were,</span>
<a name="l16839"><span class="ln">16839 </span></a>
<a name="l16840"><span class="ln">16840 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--</span>
<a name="l16841"><span class="ln">16841 </span></a><span class="s0">and yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair.</span>
<a name="l16842"><span class="ln">16842 </span></a><span class="s0">It is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--</span>
<a name="l16843"><span class="ln">16843 </span></a><span class="s0">a most distinguishing complexion!  So peculiarly the lady in it.--</span>
<a name="l16844"><span class="ln">16844 </span></a><span class="s0">Just colour enough for beauty.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16845"><span class="ln">16845 </span></a>
<a name="l16846"><span class="ln">16846 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I have always admired her complexion,&quot; replied Emma, archly; &quot;but do not</span>
<a name="l16847"><span class="ln">16847 </span></a><span class="s0">I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?--</span>
<a name="l16848"><span class="ln">16848 </span></a><span class="s0">When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16849"><span class="ln">16849 </span></a>
<a name="l16850"><span class="ln">16850 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--&quot;</span>
<a name="l16851"><span class="ln">16851 </span></a>
<a name="l16852"><span class="ln">16852 </span></a><span class="s0">But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could</span>
<a name="l16853"><span class="ln">16853 </span></a><span class="s0">not help saying,</span>
<a name="l16854"><span class="ln">16854 </span></a>
<a name="l16855"><span class="ln">16855 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,</span>
<a name="l16856"><span class="ln">16856 </span></a><span class="s0">you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--</span>
<a name="l16857"><span class="ln">16857 </span></a><span class="s0">I am sure it was a consolation to you.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16858"><span class="ln">16858 </span></a>
<a name="l16859"><span class="ln">16859 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?</span>
<a name="l16860"><span class="ln">16860 </span></a><span class="s0">I was the most miserable wretch!&quot;</span>
<a name="l16861"><span class="ln">16861 </span></a>
<a name="l16862"><span class="ln">16862 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.  I am sure it</span>
<a name="l16863"><span class="ln">16863 </span></a><span class="s0">was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking</span>
<a name="l16864"><span class="ln">16864 </span></a><span class="s0">us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell</span>
<a name="l16865"><span class="ln">16865 </span></a><span class="s0">you the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself</span>
<a name="l16866"><span class="ln">16866 </span></a><span class="s0">in the same situation.  I think there is a little likeness between us.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16867"><span class="ln">16867 </span></a>
<a name="l16868"><span class="ln">16868 </span></a><span class="s0">He bowed.</span>
<a name="l16869"><span class="ln">16869 </span></a>
<a name="l16870"><span class="ln">16870 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;If not in our dispositions,&quot; she presently added, with a look of</span>
<a name="l16871"><span class="ln">16871 </span></a><span class="s0">true sensibility, &quot;there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny</span>
<a name="l16872"><span class="ln">16872 </span></a><span class="s0">which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior</span>
<a name="l16873"><span class="ln">16873 </span></a><span class="s0">to our own.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16874"><span class="ln">16874 </span></a>
<a name="l16875"><span class="ln">16875 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;True, true,&quot; he answered, warmly.  &quot;No, not true on your side.  You can</span>
<a name="l16876"><span class="ln">16876 </span></a><span class="s0">have no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel.</span>
<a name="l16877"><span class="ln">16877 </span></a><span class="s0">Look at her.  Is not she an angel in every gesture?  Observe the turn</span>
<a name="l16878"><span class="ln">16878 </span></a><span class="s0">of her throat.  Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--</span>
<a name="l16879"><span class="ln">16879 </span></a><span class="s0">You will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)</span>
<a name="l16880"><span class="ln">16880 </span></a><span class="s0">that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels.  They are to be</span>
<a name="l16881"><span class="ln">16881 </span></a><span class="s0">new set.  I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.</span>
<a name="l16882"><span class="ln">16882 </span></a><span class="s0">Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16883"><span class="ln">16883 </span></a>
<a name="l16884"><span class="ln">16884 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Very beautiful, indeed,&quot; replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,</span>
<a name="l16885"><span class="ln">16885 </span></a><span class="s0">that he gratefully burst out,</span>
<a name="l16886"><span class="ln">16886 </span></a>
<a name="l16887"><span class="ln">16887 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such</span>
<a name="l16888"><span class="ln">16888 </span></a><span class="s0">excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world.</span>
<a name="l16889"><span class="ln">16889 </span></a><span class="s0">I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16890"><span class="ln">16890 </span></a>
<a name="l16891"><span class="ln">16891 </span></a><span class="s0">The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an</span>
<a name="l16892"><span class="ln">16892 </span></a><span class="s0">account of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before,</span>
<a name="l16893"><span class="ln">16893 </span></a><span class="s0">from the infant's appearing not quite well.  She believed she had</span>
<a name="l16894"><span class="ln">16894 </span></a><span class="s0">been foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half</span>
<a name="l16895"><span class="ln">16895 </span></a><span class="s0">a minute of sending for Mr. Perry.  Perhaps she ought to be ashamed,</span>
<a name="l16896"><span class="ln">16896 </span></a><span class="s0">but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes,</span>
<a name="l16897"><span class="ln">16897 </span></a><span class="s0">however, the child had been perfectly well again.  This was</span>
<a name="l16898"><span class="ln">16898 </span></a><span class="s0">her history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse,</span>
<a name="l16899"><span class="ln">16899 </span></a><span class="s0">who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry,</span>
<a name="l16900"><span class="ln">16900 </span></a><span class="s0">and only regretted that she had not done it.  &quot;She should always send</span>
<a name="l16901"><span class="ln">16901 </span></a><span class="s0">for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered,</span>
<a name="l16902"><span class="ln">16902 </span></a><span class="s0">were it only for a moment.  She could not be too soon alarmed,</span>
<a name="l16903"><span class="ln">16903 </span></a><span class="s0">nor send for Perry too often.  It was a pity, perhaps, that he</span>
<a name="l16904"><span class="ln">16904 </span></a><span class="s0">had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,</span>
<a name="l16905"><span class="ln">16905 </span></a><span class="s0">very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry</span>
<a name="l16906"><span class="ln">16906 </span></a><span class="s0">had seen it.&quot;</span>
<a name="l16907"><span class="ln">16907 </span></a>
<a name="l16908"><span class="ln">16908 </span></a><span class="s0">Frank Churchill caught the name.</span>
<a name="l16909"><span class="ln">16909 </span></a>
<a name="l16910"><span class="ln">16910 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Perry!&quot; said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss</span>
<a name="l16911"><span class="ln">16911 </span></a><span class="s0">Fairfax's eye.  &quot;My friend Mr. Perry!  What are they saying</span>
<a name="l16912"><span class="ln">16912 </span></a><span class="s0">about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does</span>
<a name="l16913"><span class="ln">16913 </span></a><span class="s0">he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16914"><span class="ln">16914 </span></a>
<a name="l16915"><span class="ln">16915 </span></a><span class="s0">Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined</span>
<a name="l16916"><span class="ln">16916 </span></a><span class="s0">in the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she</span>
<a name="l16917"><span class="ln">16917 </span></a><span class="s0">too was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.</span>
<a name="l16918"><span class="ln">16918 </span></a>
<a name="l16919"><span class="ln">16919 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;Such an extraordinary dream of mine!&quot; he cried.  &quot;I can never think</span>
<a name="l16920"><span class="ln">16920 </span></a><span class="s0">of it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse.</span>
<a name="l16921"><span class="ln">16921 </span></a><span class="s0">I see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown.</span>
<a name="l16922"><span class="ln">16922 </span></a><span class="s0">Look at her.  Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage</span>
<a name="l16923"><span class="ln">16923 </span></a><span class="s0">of her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--</span>
<a name="l16924"><span class="ln">16924 </span></a><span class="s0">that the whole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to</span>
<a name="l16925"><span class="ln">16925 </span></a><span class="s0">nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?&quot;</span>
<a name="l16926"><span class="ln">16926 </span></a>
<a name="l16927"><span class="ln">16927 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile</span>
<a name="l16928"><span class="ln">16928 </span></a><span class="s0">partly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,</span>
<a name="l16929"><span class="ln">16929 </span></a><span class="s0">low, yet steady voice,</span>
<a name="l16930"><span class="ln">16930 </span></a>
<a name="l16931"><span class="ln">16931 </span></a><span class="s0">&quot;How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--</span>
<a name="l16932"><span class="ln">16932 </span></a><span class="s0">They _will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!&quot;</span>
<a name="l16933"><span class="ln">16933 </span></a>
<a name="l16934"><span class="ln">16934 </span></a><span class="s0">He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly;</span>
<a name="l16935"><span class="ln">16935 </span></a><span class="s0">but Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on</span>
<a name="l16936"><span class="ln">16936 </span></a><span class="s0">leaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men,</span>
<a name="l16937"><span class="ln">16937 </span></a><span class="s0">she felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill,</span>
<a name="l16938"><span class="ln">16938 </span></a><span class="s0">and really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never</span>
<a name="l16939"><span class="ln">16939 </span></a><span class="s0">been more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character.</span>
<a name="l16940"><span class="ln">16940 </span></a><span class="s0">The happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the</span>
<a name="l16941"><span class="ln">16941 </span></a><span class="s0">animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.</span>

<a name="l16946"><span class="ln">16946 </span></a>
<a name="l16947"><span class="ln">16947 </span></a>
<a name="l16948"><span class="ln">16948 </span></a><span class="s0">If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet,</span>
<a name="l16949"><span class="ln">16949 </span></a><span class="s0">a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured</span>
<a name="l16950"><span class="ln">16950 </span></a><span class="s0">of her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept</span>
<a name="l16951"><span class="ln">16951 </span></a><span class="s0">another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she</span>
<a name="l16952"><span class="ln">16952 </span></a><span class="s0">had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty.</span>
<a name="l16953"><span class="ln">16953 </span></a><span class="s0">A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no</span>
<a name="l16954"><span class="ln">16954 </span></a><span class="s0">sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,</span>
<a name="l16955"><span class="ln">16955 </span></a><span class="s0">than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!--</span>
<a name="l16956"><span class="ln">16956 </span></a><span class="s0">that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,</span>
<a name="l16957"><span class="ln">16957 </span></a><span class="s0">and was now forming all her views of happiness.</span>
<a name="l16958"><span class="ln">16958 </span></a>
<a name="l16959"><span class="ln">16959 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:</span>
<a name="l16960"><span class="ln">16960 </span></a><span class="s0">but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,</span>
<a name="l16961"><span class="ln">16961 </span></a><span class="s0">and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die</span>
<a name="l16962"><span class="ln">16962 </span></a><span class="s0">away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,</span>
<a name="l16963"><span class="ln">16963 </span></a><span class="s0">and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to</span>
<a name="l16964"><span class="ln">16964 </span></a><span class="s0">her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of</span>
<a name="l16965"><span class="ln">16965 </span></a><span class="s0">that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--</span>
<a name="l16966"><span class="ln">16966 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at</span>
<a name="l16967"><span class="ln">16967 </span></a><span class="s0">Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all</span>
<a name="l16968"><span class="ln">16968 </span></a><span class="s0">with the utmost delight.  But what did such particulars explain?--</span>
<a name="l16969"><span class="ln">16969 </span></a><span class="s0">The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had</span>
<a name="l16970"><span class="ln">16970 </span></a><span class="s0">always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had</span>
<a name="l16971"><span class="ln">16971 </span></a><span class="s0">been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible</span>
<a name="l16972"><span class="ln">16972 </span></a><span class="s0">to Emma.</span>
<a name="l16973"><span class="ln">16973 </span></a>
<a name="l16974"><span class="ln">16974 </span></a><span class="s0">The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her</span>
<a name="l16975"><span class="ln">16975 </span></a><span class="s0">fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.</span>
<a name="l16976"><span class="ln">16976 </span></a><span class="s0">She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford</span>
<a name="l16977"><span class="ln">16977 </span></a><span class="s0">her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent</span>
<a name="l16978"><span class="ln">16978 </span></a><span class="s0">enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood</span>
<a name="l16979"><span class="ln">16979 </span></a><span class="s0">of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--</span>
<a name="l16980"><span class="ln">16980 </span></a><span class="s0">It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many</span>
<a name="l16981"><span class="ln">16981 </span></a><span class="s0">a gentleman:  but what a connexion had she been preparing for</span>
<a name="l16982"><span class="ln">16982 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--</span>
<a name="l16983"><span class="ln">16983 </span></a><span class="s0">The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth,</span>
<a name="l16984"><span class="ln">16984 </span></a><span class="s0">would have been a stain indeed.</span>
<a name="l16985"><span class="ln">16985 </span></a>
<a name="l16986"><span class="ln">16986 </span></a><span class="s0">No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was</span>
<a name="l16987"><span class="ln">16987 </span></a><span class="s0">treated liberally; it was all as it should be:  and as Emma became</span>
<a name="l16988"><span class="ln">16988 </span></a><span class="s0">acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l16989"><span class="ln">16989 </span></a><span class="s0">she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth</span>
<a name="l16990"><span class="ln">16990 </span></a><span class="s0">which could bid fairest for her little friend.  She had no doubt</span>
<a name="l16991"><span class="ln">16991 </span></a><span class="s0">of Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him,</span>
<a name="l16992"><span class="ln">16992 </span></a><span class="s0">and in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more,</span>
<a name="l16993"><span class="ln">16993 </span></a><span class="s0">of security, stability, and improvement.  She would be placed in the</span>
<a name="l16994"><span class="ln">16994 </span></a><span class="s0">midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;</span>
<a name="l16995"><span class="ln">16995 </span></a><span class="s0">retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.</span>
<a name="l16996"><span class="ln">16996 </span></a><span class="s0">She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out.</span>
<a name="l16997"><span class="ln">16997 </span></a><span class="s0">She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be</span>
<a name="l16998"><span class="ln">16998 </span></a><span class="s0">the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and</span>
<a name="l16999"><span class="ln">16999 </span></a><span class="s0">persevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest,</span>
<a name="l17000"><span class="ln">17000 </span></a><span class="s0">to yield only to herself.</span>
<a name="l17001"><span class="ln">17001 </span></a>
<a name="l17002"><span class="ln">17002 </span></a><span class="s0">Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,</span>
<a name="l17003"><span class="ln">17003 </span></a><span class="s0">was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--</span>
<a name="l17004"><span class="ln">17004 </span></a><span class="s0">The intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must</span>
<a name="l17005"><span class="ln">17005 </span></a><span class="s0">change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought</span>
<a name="l17006"><span class="ln">17006 </span></a><span class="s0">to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual,</span>
<a name="l17007"><span class="ln">17007 </span></a><span class="s0">natural manner.</span>
<a name="l17008"><span class="ln">17008 </span></a>
<a name="l17009"><span class="ln">17009 </span></a><span class="s0">Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw</span>
<a name="l17010"><span class="ln">17010 </span></a><span class="s0">her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,</span>
<a name="l17011"><span class="ln">17011 </span></a><span class="s0">as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood</span>
<a name="l17012"><span class="ln">17012 </span></a><span class="s0">before them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she</span>
<a name="l17013"><span class="ln">17013 </span></a><span class="s0">scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the</span>
<a name="l17014"><span class="ln">17014 </span></a><span class="s0">altar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith,</span>
<a name="l17015"><span class="ln">17015 </span></a><span class="s0">the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.</span>
<a name="l17016"><span class="ln">17016 </span></a>
<a name="l17017"><span class="ln">17017 </span></a><span class="s0">Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the</span>
<a name="l17018"><span class="ln">17018 </span></a><span class="s0">comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills</span>
<a name="l17019"><span class="ln">17019 </span></a><span class="s0">were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.</span>
<a name="l17020"><span class="ln">17020 </span></a>
<a name="l17021"><span class="ln">17021 </span></a><span class="s0">The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,</span>
<a name="l17022"><span class="ln">17022 </span></a><span class="s0">by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage</span>
<a name="l17023"><span class="ln">17023 </span></a><span class="s0">ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,</span>
<a name="l17024"><span class="ln">17024 </span></a><span class="s0">to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside,</span>
<a name="l17025"><span class="ln">17025 </span></a><span class="s0">which was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend,</span>
<a name="l17026"><span class="ln">17026 </span></a><span class="s0">were agreed in approving it.  But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse</span>
<a name="l17027"><span class="ln">17027 </span></a><span class="s0">to be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their</span>
<a name="l17028"><span class="ln">17028 </span></a><span class="s0">marriage but as a distant event.</span>
<a name="l17029"><span class="ln">17029 </span></a>
<a name="l17030"><span class="ln">17030 </span></a><span class="s0">When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they</span>
<a name="l17031"><span class="ln">17031 </span></a><span class="s0">were almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--</span>
<a name="l17032"><span class="ln">17032 </span></a><span class="s0">He began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--</span>
<a name="l17033"><span class="ln">17033 </span></a><span class="s0">a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.</span>
<a name="l17034"><span class="ln">17034 </span></a><span class="s0">Still, however, he was not happy.  Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,</span>
<a name="l17035"><span class="ln">17035 </span></a><span class="s0">that his daughter's courage failed.  She could not bear to see</span>
<a name="l17036"><span class="ln">17036 </span></a><span class="s0">him suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though</span>
<a name="l17037"><span class="ln">17037 </span></a><span class="s0">her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the</span>
<a name="l17038"><span class="ln">17038 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress</span>
<a name="l17039"><span class="ln">17039 </span></a><span class="s0">would be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.</span>
<a name="l17040"><span class="ln">17040 </span></a>
<a name="l17041"><span class="ln">17041 </span></a><span class="s0">In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden</span>
<a name="l17042"><span class="ln">17042 </span></a><span class="s0">illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his</span>
<a name="l17043"><span class="ln">17043 </span></a><span class="s0">nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--</span>
<a name="l17044"><span class="ln">17044 </span></a><span class="s0">Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys--</span>
<a name="l17045"><span class="ln">17045 </span></a><span class="s0">evidently by the ingenuity of man.  Other poultry-yards in the</span>
<a name="l17046"><span class="ln">17046 </span></a><span class="s0">neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to</span>
<a name="l17047"><span class="ln">17047 </span></a><span class="s0">Mr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense</span>
<a name="l17048"><span class="ln">17048 </span></a><span class="s0">of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm</span>
<a name="l17049"><span class="ln">17049 </span></a><span class="s0">every night of his life.  The strength, resolution, and presence</span>
<a name="l17050"><span class="ln">17050 </span></a><span class="s0">of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.</span>
<a name="l17051"><span class="ln">17051 </span></a><span class="s0">While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--</span>
<a name="l17052"><span class="ln">17052 </span></a><span class="s0">But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the</span>
